**Publisher's Statement**

According to the Jain Shastra, the primary goal of a Jiva is to attain liberation (Moksha), which is the state of supreme bliss. To achieve this state, aspirants (Mumukṣus) must strive for spiritual development through the path of Yoga and Adhyatma.

The practice of acquiring knowledge is achieved through the study of rare texts and Yoga. To facilitate this, revered Acharyas have graciously provided numerous texts for self-study. Among these, the Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya, authored by the revered Acharya Haribhadrasuriśvara, stands as a pinnacle. This text outlines the path of gradual spiritual development for the benefit of aspirants.

To help seekers understand the essence of this text, the late Dr. Bhagvandas Man:sukhbhai Mehta had written a beautiful commentary many years ago. This was published in book form in 1950 (first edition) by Seth Shri Mansukh Bhai Tarachand Mehta in memory of the late Shrimati Lilavatiben.

The family of the commentator, the late Dr. Bhagvandas Man:sukhbhai Mehta, is currently without any members. The family of the publisher, the late Seth Shri Mansukh Bhai Tarachand Mehta, has agreed to republish the Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya text, recognizing its religious significance. This decision has been made by his daughter Kokilaben V. Parekh and Shrimati Arunaben. We wholeheartedly applaud their generous spirit.

This new edition is the auspicious result of the inspiration of the revered Kanakchandra Shah and the generous support of the Shri Jain Dharma Pedhi, Shri Shrimali Pol Jain Sangh, Bharuch. We are deeply grateful to the Sangh for this noble endeavor.

We express our gratitude to the learned Pandit Shri Pravinchandra Mataji, the commentator of many texts of the Shri Gitārtha Ganga, for granting permission to print the "Bhed Prabhed Vṛkṣa" table from his published work in this publication.

We are indebted to Shri Nautambhai Ratilal Shah for the beautiful printing work and to Shri Shrenikbhai Kirtibhai Shah for the equally beautiful work of proofreading.

The Shri Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya holds a unique position in the Jain community and educational institutions. Through the publication of numerous books related to Jinaagamas and Jain philosophy, the Shri Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya carries out the work of spreading knowledge as a manifestation of the influence of the Jinasasana.

We are delighted to publish the third edition of the Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya text. We have faith that this text will be a source of well-being in the lives of our devout student brothers and sisters, that it will foster the growth of spiritual aspirants, and that it will help everyone to develop inner qualities and achieve equality.

With faith,

Yours truly,

Hitesh Chimanlal Doshi, Mumbai.

##  Preface to the First Edition

66
**The first edition preface**

"He who has destroyed the roots of attachment, aversion, and delusion, like the sprout of a seed, is worthy of my salutations, whether he be a Brahmavadi or a Vishnuvadi." - Shri Hemachandracharya.

"...All that is external is the source of sorrow, all that is internal is the source of happiness;
This is the essence of the self, this is the true nature of the self. Tell me, what is happiness?" - Shri Yashavijayaji, January 26, 1950.

On this auspicious day, I begin writing this preface. Today, this land of Bharat, the sacred land of Shri Yageshvara, is celebrating the unprecedented festival of complete independence. This worldly independence reminds us of the transcendental, inner freedom of the soul. It makes us ponder: This soul, burdened by the heavy weight of the eternal ignorance, is bound by the chains of karma, and thus experiences the great suffering of dependence. How can this soul, by discarding the shackles of ignorance, the root cause of this suffering, attain the 'unprecedented opportunity' of self-rule, the kingdom of the soul, the abode of happiness? When will this soul-being, freed from the shackles of dependence, experience the unique joy of liberation? How can the soul attain the supreme bliss of complete inner freedom? When will the soul, dwelling in its own home, play and revel in its own home, filled with joy? When will this soul-ocean overflow with the nectar of joy, and the auspicious victory cry resound?"

66
"You will break through the barriers within my heart, the auspicious victory cry will resound;
The soul-ocean will overflow with joy, the nectar of bliss will flow..."
Padmaprabha Jin! What will break through the barriers within my heart, O Lord?" - Shri Anandghanaji.
"The soul dwells in its own home, its own home is filled with joy." - Shri Devchandraji.

The answer to all these questions lies in one single path. The one who liberates us from dependence and grants us the unparalleled achievement of inner freedom, who makes the soul Shiva, who grants the soul the 'true self' - the supreme self-realization, the 'self-state' - if there is anyone who can do this, it is Yaga. And the right way to this Yaga, the path to the true nature of the self, is the path of complete non-violence...

The science of yoga is that which is demonstrated step by step with rituals. And among them, this collection of yoga insights, a new form of yoga science, has an unparalleled place; it presents many new and original ideas, and its place is unique as it illuminates the pure, closed light of the divine eye in an unprecedented "Gadishta" form. Just as the gods churned the ocean and obtained nectar, so too did the great sage Haribhadracharya, a great sage, churned the ocean of scriptures and obtained this nectar - by partaking of it as desired, the soul-seeker "Jegi-jane" attains immortality.

And attaining and bestowing this nirvana-like immortality is the ultimate purpose of this age-guiding text, both for the speaker and the listener, as clearly stated in its auspicious introduction by these great age-teachers. This selfless scholar, free from the trivial desires of honor, worship, fame, etc., has engaged in this activity for the benefit of beings, for the ultimate good, with pure intention, solely for the sake of the soul - which is the seed of nirvana, the cause of liberation. And holding the great mantra "One is for the sake of the soul, the other is not for the mind's sake" in their heart, any true soul-seeker who studies this scripture will also engage in yoga appropriately, which will make them the seed of nirvana; because this Gadishti is a measure of the soul's spiritual development, a "thermometer" for the state of the soul. By knowing its form correctly, the discerning listener can infer from it their own spiritual progress, the state of their soul, and the quality of their soul. "In which vision am I superior?" "Do I have the qualities and characteristics mentioned in that vision?" "If not, how should I strive to attain them?" By introspecting in this way, this yoga insight will be extremely beneficial and helpful to the soul-seeker, and through appropriate conduct, it will become the sure cause of liberation. Thus, this sacred scripture is for the ultimate benefit of both the speaker and the listener, the sure remedy for self-liberation.

The first line is occupied by the great luminaries. The supreme mystery of the Hudshan, the renowned "Shatudana-vetta" Haribhadrasuri, who has sensed it, has shown a new direction of the Gamamarg, which challenges all doctrines and philosophies and harmonizes all philosophies with the "Shatu Darshan Jin Ang Bhanje". In his vast, ocean-like expanse, he has embraced all with ease, offering a supremely profound and generous "divine vision". This Tatvadrashta Gacharya has invited all philosophers to a universal, vast platform with love, bringing them together in a spirit of equality and brotherhood. He has condemned the false quarrels that are carried out in the name of religion with prejudice, and has connected the Gidh Dharma, which is imbued with the unique spirit of world brotherhood, to the eternal Atma Dharma. The discerning reader will be amazed to see how this divine visionary developed the noble spirit of equality towards all philosophies, devoid of attachment and aversion, on the philosophical platform twelve years ago! And this is the main characteristic among the many unique features of this gem of a book.

In the auspicious moment of the year 1943, I was fortunate enough to come across this excellent book. While studying it, I spontaneously felt the urge to write a detailed commentary on this true scripture. Therefore, I have decided to undertake this project to give concrete form to this inner inspiration to write a detailed commentary that would enhance the essence and glory of this scripture: (1) The original text in the Gujarati form of poetic translation. (2) The literal meaning for the people. (3) A literal translation of Sri Haribhadrasuriji's Paz Vritti in the footnotes. (4) A continuous and detailed commentary that encompasses and enriches the essence of the text and the Vritti (called "Sumanandani Bahutika"). (5) A new creation of Kalashka, which is the essence and support of each chapter in each chapter. - Thus, I have set a five-pronged plan and have been actively engaged in this sacred activity according to the above plan. With full enthusiasm, I have been moving forward, sometimes at a fast pace and sometimes at a slow pace, and I completed this work of commentary at the end of 1945. I am delighted to place this book in the hands of the discerning, intellectual, and philosophical readers. If any success is evident in this humble effort, which has been undertaken with a pure heart, it is solely due to the grace of the knowledgeable, virtuous men, without whose powerful support of the nectar of their words, this effort would have been like a cripple's attempt to reach the fruit, which is beyond his reach!

I have given some direction to the subject matter of this book in the introduction. Its detailed explanation in the form of a tree is discussed in the respective chapters of the vision. For guidance, there is no space here. * The knowledge of the ignorant is like a boat without a rudder. | The audience, therefore, should be aware of this.

No. (See Table of Contents). From the essence of each right, as well as from the new structure I have made of the essence and confirmation of that right, the wise reader will be able to understand the subject matter of this book. I have shown the detailed consideration of each subject specified here in the commentary - 'Sumananda's Bhatiatika'. Especially in it, Ichayaeg, Shastraag, Samarthyaweg, Ahimsaad, Yama, Nimitt and Upadaan, Gabija, Avachakatrayi, Samapatti, Vedya Sanvedya Pad, Adya Sanvedya Pad, Visham Kutka Graha, Sarvagna Tattva Abhed, Akshapak Gnan, Asang Anushthan, Dhyata Dhyan and Dhyeya, Samadhi, Mukta Tattva, Ichayamaadi, Kulgi, Pravritt Chakghi, etc. I have done a special Mimamsa on these extremely interesting and original new topics in my 'Sumananda's Tika', which will be interesting to the seeker of truth 'Sumana'. The original text on those topics is often in the form of a brief summary, only suggesting the ultimate purpose, but this book has become so voluminous! However, this voluminousness is forgivable in the face of the virtues and glory of this presented gem of a book. I have been given this 'unprecedented opportunity' to show my devotion to the scriptures as much as possible through self-study, so I feel blessed, and I invite every seeker of truth with love to immerse themselves in this devotional rasa and taste the nectar of truth.

" येनात्माऽबुध्यतात्मैव परत्वेनैव चापरम् ।
અક્ષયાનન્તવવાર, તબૈ સિદ્ધાત્મને નમઃ | ”—શ્રી પૂજ્યપાદસ્વામી

Before delving into the subject matter of this treatise, "Yoga-Dristi-Samuchaya Shastra," it is essential to understand the nature of bondage, the cause of suffering, and liberation, the cause of happiness. This will pave the way for a clear understanding of the essence of Yoga and the subject matter of this text. We will explore this in three main sections: (I) Introduction, (II) Subject Matter, (III) Significance.

**I. Introduction**

1. **The Nature of Bondage and Liberation:** All beings naturally desire happiness and abhor suffering. Everyone strives to avoid suffering and attain happiness, yet they fail to achieve this. Why? This question has led to profound philosophical inquiries by many wise thinkers. The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, the endless suffering of the "Bhava-Bhraanti" (delusion of existence), how can it be ended?  The profound contemplation of this truth led the enlightened beings like Lord Mahavira to discover the ultimate solution. This compassionate ocean of wisdom, for the welfare of the world, has revealed the truth. Through their own experience, they have established the true nature of reality: the eternal, imperishable soul, distinct from the body and all other material possessions. 

Page #12:
---------------------------
There is a thing called "Atma" which is 11 imperishable conscious form, and it has been afflicted by the suffering of this cycle of birth and death due to the association of inert matter (Tadanaya) with it. When this Atma gets separated from the association of this other thing called Karma, it will be freed from the suffering of this cycle of birth and death; it will be freed from the bondage of Karma, which is the abode of suffering, and attain liberation, which is the abode of happiness and self-independence.
"Kanako Palavat Padi Purush Tani, Jedi Anadi Swabhav; Anya Sagi Jya Lagi Atma, Sansari Kehvaay...Padma Prabh." Shri Anandghanaji.
A natural question arises here: Atma is conscious and Karma is inert, the result of consciousness is consciousness and the result of inertness is inertness. Thus, these two things are different, then how can there be a combination-bond between them? And how is that bond arranged? The solution is that the bond occurs due to the Karma-related maturity of the Atma, which is conducive to the Karma-relationship, and it does not occur without such suitability. This Karma-related maturity of the Atma is called "Mal" - Bhavamal*. It pollutes the pure nature of the Atma, makes it impure, that is why it is called "Mal". This Mal is inherent in the Atma, it is Anadi, therefore the Karma-bond arising from it is also Anadi - just as the moments of the past are Anadi in the flow of time. (See Gabindu).
And from this, the arrangement of the bond also occurs inevitably, because the Atma's interest-oriented maturity-enjoyment towards the external influence is the form of Bhavamal. Thus, this
- Bhavamal is the result of the Atma, therefore it is Bhavakam. Therefore, the Atma is the doer of this bond, which is the cause-effect of Bhavakam. Due to the arrangement of this conscious Bhavakarma, the inert Pudgal Dravya takes the form of Jeevviya and becomes eight types of Dravyakarma, namely Jnanavarniyaadi. As said in Shri Atmasiddhi, "Bhavkam Nij Kalpana, Mate Chetanarup; Jeevviriya Ni Kurana, Grahan Kare
* (1) This Atma is known as "Purush" by the Jains and Vedantins, Buddhists call it "Jnana", and Sankhya calls it "Kshetravid". (2) Tadanaya - Jain calls this other thing "Karma", Buddhists and Vedantins call it "Avidya", and Sankhya calls it "Prakriti". (3) And the association with it, which is called "Bond", is called "Bhrant" by Buddhists and Vedantins, and "Pravritti" by Sankhya. (4) This Karma-related suitability, which is Bhavamal, is called "Diksha" - the desire to see Prakriti Vikaran by Sankhya, "Bhavbeej" by Sho, "Avidya" which is Bhrant by Vedantins, and "Vasana" which is Anadi Klesh by Saumya. Thus, despite the difference in terminology due to the difference in views, the substance is not different. This is the truth of all Darshanas. "Atma Tanyatha Sanft Tadriyaora: I a gva Mu Ghani Ja Vastramaadyaachora zatha." (See Shri Haribhadrasuri's Gabindu)

**The Inert Group.** This means that the soul is the doer in a relative and conditional way, due to the material cause. Here, the example of a goldsmith is relevant. The goldsmith makes ornaments due to the relative and conditional nature of his thoughts, and he is the doer in a consequential way, due to his own happiness, joy, etc. From this material cause, the body and other things are produced, and the soul, residing in the body, experiences the arising of the material cause. When this arises, if the soul becomes involved in the emotions of attachment, aversion, and delusion, it becomes the cause of a new emotion, and due to this emotion, the material cause arises again. Thus, the cycle of rebirth and death continues. In Jain terminology, the emotion is called 'mal' and the material cause is called 'raj'. Just as dirt sticks to a sticky substance, similarly, due to the attachment and affection, which are like sticky substances, the material cause, which is like dirt, sticks to it. Thus, due to the mutual relative and conditional nature of the cause and effect, the emotion and the material cause are interdependent. The emotion gives rise to the material cause, and the material cause gives rise to the emotion, thus creating a vicious circle. Due to this, the cycle of birth and death, with its various forms, continues to revolve.

Thus, the emotion of attachment, which is the root cause of all suffering, is the cause of the cycle of rebirth. Therefore, the root cause of worldly existence is the ignorance of the true nature of the soul, which is the ignorance of the soul's true nature. The mistaken identification of the self with the body and other external objects is the biggest mistake of the soul, and this mistaken identification gives rise to the cycle of rebirth. Because, due to the imagination of the self in external objects, attachment, aversion, and delusion arise due to those objects. Therefore, due to the protection of those objects, passions arise, and in this way, the eighteen types of sins are born. Due to this fundamental delusion of identifying the self with the body, the activities of the mind, speech, and body become conducive to external objects and emotions. The path is lost, and the goal is missed. The mind becomes filled with thoughts about external objects and emotions, speech becomes filled with false words about external objects and emotions, and the body becomes involved in activities to obtain external objects and emotions. Thus, the evil activities of the mind, speech, and body, which are like 'sucintitra hummasim stuiti', give rise to 'suchyu', which is evil deeds.

"Due to the attachment to external objects, the mind becomes filled with passion, and the body becomes stained with the blood of others. Due to the desire to protect external objects, the soul becomes attached to them." - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, the delusion of identifying the self with external objects arises, the true knowledge becomes false, and the good conduct becomes bad conduct. Due to the delusion of the self, the delusion of conduct arises, and intense passions like 'anatanubandhi' etc. begin to arise. Due to these two types of delusions, the nature of the soul becomes corrupted, and its liberation becomes impossible.

The nature of the other, the killer, is knowledge-obscuring, vision-obscuring, and an obstacle, and it also begins to bind. Similarly, the painful, life, name, and body, these non-killer natures also begin to bind. And the liberated soul, originally pure in nature, becomes bound by the tight bonds of the eightfold karma, suffering in the cycle of existence, in an endless cycle of birth and death. Thus, when the commander of the army of vision-delusion (mithyatva) enters, the entire army of karma, following it, attacks the soul, makes a strong attack on the soul's territory, and destroys its field! The king of kings, delusion-king, entered the city of consciousness with great pomp, so the entire family of karma, shouting his victory, followed him and surrounded the soul's territory! And for the crime of transgressing the father's field of matter, the soul was imprisoned and thrown into the hell of the world! "The retribution for the enemy!"
"There are infinite types, of which the main eight, of which the main delusion, the killer, I say the lesson. Karma, delusion, two divisions, vision, character, name;
Two kill, non-attachment, the infallible remedy thus." Shri Atmasiddhi. The soul, having pierced its own nature, its own dharma, moved towards the other, therefore the other, the adharma, clung to it, and thus karma-Rahu eclipsed the soul-moon, causing terrible consequences, the soul was forced to join its father; for the sin of interfering in the other's field, the punishment is received, "What you do with your hands, you will suffer in your heart!" "The house is in turmoil!" This is a very big mistake of the living being, a serious mistake like "a mistake of a mountain in a sesame seed!" The father forgot the father, what other darkness is greater than this? "You forgot your own, what darkness is this!" With this fundamental mistake of the soul-consciousness in the body, a complex web of other incidental mistakes also arose. "The principal and the interest have increased greatly!" What a terrible consequence of a single mistake!
Or, in another way, consider that there are two divisions of the so-called delusion-karma that entangles the world in the web of delusion-maya. Vision-delusion and character-delusion. Of these, (1) due to the vision-delusion of the soul-consciousness in the body and other objects, the living being has mithyatva or false vision, and therefore character-delusion also arises. (2) Therefore, because of the soul-consciousness in the other, the living being does not become detached from the other and remains restless. (3) Thus, because of its movement and transformation towards the other, it attains the corruption of its form, the delusion. (4) And because of the attainment and non-attainment of the other, it performs the passions of anger, etc., and creates the emotions of attachment and aversion, etc.

He worships. (5) And thus, the activities of his mind, speech, and body, which are affected by it, also primarily act in accordance with that external influence for the attainment of that external influence. Thus, due to the original ignorance-like self-delusion, the five asrava-laden karma-influx channels of mithyatva, aviriti, pramada, kshaya, and vega remain open. Therefore, the soul is bound by karma due to these binding causes, and the bound soul experiences the suffering of transmigration. On the other hand, (1) when the self-delusion, which is the self-consciousness in the external influence, is abandoned, and the soul becomes self-conscious in the soul itself, then mithyatva is avoided, darshanamoha is destroyed, and samyagdarshan is revealed. (2) Then, the aviriti defect is avoided, and there is cessation from all external influences - bhavavirati occurs. (3) Therefore, the pramada defect, which is the corruption from the self-nature, is avoided, and there is a state of apramada-apramatta (non-negligence) in the self-nature. (4) Therefore, there is no kshaya due to external influence, no staining by raga-adi vibhava, and there is complete nishkshaya-purna vitraga. (5) And with the destruction of kshaya-generated agitation, the yoga of mind, speech, and body also becomes conducive to self-stability, and finally, the ayoga state is attained. Thus, there is sanvara, which is the closing of the asrava-doors for the influx of karma. With the destruction of darshanamoha, charitramoha is also destroyed in sequence; bodha is the sure remedy for destroying darshanamoha, and vitraga is the sure remedy for destroying charitramoha. This arrangement of the three types of mohaniya karma, the leading karma of darshanamoha-charitramoha, and the five binding causes, which are its subdivisions, clearly explains the entire arrangement of the fourteen gunasthanas, because the constitution of these gunasthanas is primarily based on the attainment and abandonment of these mohas. As the amount of moha decreases and the nishkshaya vitraga maturity of the soul increases, the true saadhutva-sadhakatva, which is the development of the soul's qualities, is revealed.
Thus, it is clear from the understanding of karma-bandha and its binding causes that self-delusion is the root of this suffering of transmigration. When does this self-delusion cease? The root cause, this self-delusion, ceases. Because, as we have seen, there is an arrangement in which bhavamokhsa is connected to dravyakarma, and dravyakarma is connected to bhavakarma, and the vicious circle of binding continues, and therefore, due to the principle of cyclical rotation, the cycle of births and deaths also continues. When does this chain of karma-bandha break? When does this vicious cycle end? When bhavakarma, which is self-delusion, ceases, then this chain breaks and this vicious cycle ends. In other words, when the soul refuses to have the feeling of self in the body and other external influences, when it "rejects" and abandons the vibhava that results in the opposite feeling of raga-dvesha-moha, then bhavakarma is not bound, and due to the absence of that cause, dravyakarma is also not bound, and this chain of karma-bandha...

##  English Translation:

15. The chain breaks. Thus, the reins of breaking this bondage are in the hands of the soul, not as a result of the feeling of detachment, but as a result of the effort to press the brake (Chui-k) of non-attachment, the secret key (Master-key) of effort is in the possession of the soul itself. The meaning is that the soul does not become attached to passion, aversion, or affection due to external influences, but remains detached, this is the key. Thus, the effort of the soul bound by karma is always open. It is only a matter of time before the soul abandons the false attachments of worldly existence and engages in true effort. This is the call to the lion-like soul, the master of infinite power, to roar and destroy the Shugal (evil). The soul only needs to rise. As Shrimad Rajchandraji has roared, "When the soul rises, then the color will be seen." 3tti Dottiz Sakar! The awakened soul, through the wisdom of discrimination, realizes the pure form of the father, abandons the inferior form of detachment, and embraces the eternal Dharma of the soul, then it will surely attain liberation, "The soul will reside in its true form."

"That which is the ultimate goal, is the true effort;
Do not abandon the soul's purpose, even if you take the name of worldly existence." Shri Atmasiddhi. From this arrangement of bondage and liberation, the nine principles enunciated by Lord Mahavira become clear. This soul is bound by karma, which is non-soul. There are two divisions of this non-soul karma: virtue and vice. The cause of karma is the five asravas (influx) of wrong belief, etc. When asravas occur, bondage happens. Asravas can be stopped by samvara, which is like closing the doors to new karma. Old karma can be destroyed by tapas (austerity) like meditation. By continuously destroying karma, the soul attains liberation, which is the pure state of the soul. Only the pure "Advaita" (non-dual) soul is the true form of liberation.

"Trishlata also contemplated in her mind, increased her knowledge, discrimination, and thought, and constantly emphasized the nine principles, with excellent understanding and many pronouncements." Shri Meksha Mala.

To understand these nine principles with proper discrimination, one should know the four aspects of the medical science: First, one should know what the disease (Disease) is. This is the disease that needs to be cured. Second, one should know the cause (Aetiology) of the disease. This is the cause of the disease. Third, one should know the cure (Normal healthy condition, cure). 
_* " हेयं दुःखमनागतम् । दृष्टश्ययोः संयोगो हेयहेतुः। तदभावात् संयोगाभावो हानं तद् દશે: ચૈત્રયમ્ ! વિવાહયાતિરવિજીવા દાનોપાય | પાતંજલ યંગસુત્ર, ૨.

What? One should know its form; this is the disease. And what is the fourth remedy for the disease (Therapeutic treatment)? One should know that; this is the purpose of the disease. Thus, here (1) the ajiva karma and the samsara arising from it are the disease, therefore they are to be avoided. (2) The purpose of this karma disease, which is to be avoided, is asrava and bandha, this is the purpose of the disease to be avoided. (3) The remedies for removing the purpose of this karma disease are samvara and nirjara. (4) And the removal of the karma disease is moksha, that is, the health of the soul. In this way, the Bhagwan Vitrag, the physician of the bhavyadhis, has shown the amegh chikitsa of this maha-bhavarega of the jiva, and by establishing this jagatarak tirtharup shuddha "dharmachakra", he has made his name "tirthankara" meaningful.

"Because of the cause, the bandha is bound, because of the cause, the mukti is released;
Asrava samvara, by name, in order, O Padeya, listen....Padma Prabhu 0" Shri Anandghanji.

Thus, samsara is the biggest disease of the soul, and its cause is karma, so being under the control of karma is the root of the bhavarega dukha. To be free from this karma parakhanti - karma bandha - is the ultimate happiness, that is, the pure nature of the soul, "healthy" state of health is the sukhadham moksha.

## 2. The main definition of yoga and the unity of the path of moksha

"This is the yogi, the form of infinite happiness; the original pure soul, the companion of the jina form. The jina pad and the nij pad are one, there is no difference.
To become the lakshya, they are called sukhadayi by the scriptures." - Shrimad Rajchandra. And this pure nature of the soul, "healthy" state of health, which is moksha, is called "yoga". The word yoga is derived from the root "yuj". Yuj means to go, to join (To unite). It is called "yoga" because it unites the jiva with moksha. "Mokshena roganatu chora" is its main definition. Thus, the process by which the soul attains the moksha pad or nirvana pad, which is the pure atmasiddhi, is called yoga. This moksha, which is the ultimate goal, may be known by any name, some call it shivpad, some call it jinapad, some call it buddhapada, some call it siddhapada, some call it ahanta, some call it parabrahma, some call it parameshthipada, some call it parmatmapada, some call it tathata, some call it siddhatma - but despite the difference in words, there is no difference in the ultimate meaning, in the natural form of the soul, in the pure atmaswarup pad. There is only one Ganga river, some call it Bhagirathi, some call it Surnadi, some call it Tripathga, some call it Mandakini, some call it Jahnavi...

Say, but in essence, there is no change in that thing. Similarly, even if this Nirvanu-jnata pada, which is infinite in its qualities, is known by any name that is a combination of its qualities, in essence, there is no difference from the Paramatma.
“What is the difference in words, O Kissoji? If the ultimate truth is one; whether you call it Ganga or Suraniji, the thing is not different.” — Shri Yashovijayji. The meaning is that this ‘Parantattva’, which is beyond the world and beyond which there is nothing, is the common, non-dualistic definition of this Yaga, which is connected to everything. And the fruit of this is that the soul’s union with its own pure nature—its innate nature—is the manifest, clear form of this Yaga. “What the yogi desires”—what the yogi yearns for. To attain this Atmapada, which is the pure form of infinite bliss, is the sole purpose of this Yaga. And this pure Atmasvarupa, the unity of the Jinapada and the Nijapatta, is without any difference, and to attain this is the purpose of all scriptures, which are conducive to happiness.

Thus, the path to attain the supreme peace, which is Moksha, is Yaga, and Moksha is the definite goal of all beings, so the means to attain it, this Yaga path, is also one, and it is only in the Shantima, for those who are Shmapa-rayana, Shmanishtha, those who are seeking liberation. This Shma means the ultimate self-evolution, the single Shmanishtha, the state of being free from attachment and aversion, equanimity. Shri Kundakundacharya has defined Shantima as the state of being free from the Ma-Aabha, the result of the soul, that is called Sama. Or Shma means samya, that is, to become equal to the Atmaguna, as it is, in its true form. That which is samya is Dharma, and ‘Vahyusaddavo Dhamma’ the nature of the thing is Dharma. This Dharma is Charitra, and ‘Svarupe Chala Pashtr’ to walk in the form—to dwell in the Atmasvarupa—is Charitra. Thus, Charitra=Dharma=Samya=Sama=Shma are synonymous words. The meaning is that to reside in samya, that is, in the Atmasvarupa, to understand the form and to dwell in the form, is Shma, to be free from the influence of others and to rest in the self-nature is Shanti, and that is the Shmanishtha path or the Shantima path. Mahagita Chougishwar Anandghanji has sung the unparalleled form of this Shantima. For example—
“Our Atmabhava, which is pure
Chetanadhar;
With the union of all beings, it is the essence of our own family... Shanti Jin.” Those who desire to go towards that Paratattva, all the Mumukhus, desire to attain that one Shantima, so they are one, like the waves on the shore of the ocean of time, even though there are differences in their states.

Due to the 18 distinctions, some are closer to the arrow-target and some are farther away.  Meaning, all are devotees-worshippers-adorers of the one undivided, indivisible, supreme, nectar-ocean, form of the Mokshamarg, they are all brothers in Dharma.
"एक एव तु मार्गोऽपि तेषां शमपरायणः ।
સવથમેમેસેડર ગઢવી તીમrian I” –Shri Agadashtisamucchya.
This supreme peaceful Mokshamarg, the jewel-triad, the supremely beautiful plan, has been shown by Jin Bhagwan. "સગવાનજ્ઞાનરાત્રિાણિ મોક્ષમા ' Samyagdarshan-Jnana-Charitra, the oneness of these three, is the "Moolamarg" of the Jins. "The soul is different from the body, etc., it is always useful, imperishable....
Listen to the Moolamarg of the Jins. As if the Sadguru has taught, the knowledge is called Moola. The knowledge that is known, its conduct is called pure Pratit Moola. Bhagwan has said that Darshan is called Moola. Its other name is Samyak....Moola. As this Pratit comes to the soul, it is known to be different from all, unattached....Moola. That stable nature which arises, its name is Charitra, it is called Analingam....Moola. These three are undivided, the result of which, when it conducts, is the soul-form....Moola. That path of the Jins is attained, or the self-form is attained....Moola."
–Shrimad Rajchandra.
Thus, this Shamaprayan, Shantimarg, Agammarg, Mokshamarg, "Jin's Moolamarg", which leads to the Paramatattva-Moksha, beyond the Bhavatit-Samsara.  Those who are truly Mumukhs, who have a selfless, inner desire to be free from the bondage of Bhava, are the ones who are eligible for this Mokshamarg.  Those who have attained the pacification of Kshaya, who have no other desire than Moksha, who have disgust and boredom towards the world, and who have compassion for all beings, such a soul-being is fit to attain this Yogmarg.  Until the soul attains this "G" state, it will not attain the Mokshamarg, nor will its inner disease be cured.
"Pacification of Kshaya, only Moksha desire;
Disgust towards Bhava, compassion for beings, there the soul resides. Until that state, the soul does not attain the Yog;
It does not attain the Mokshamarg, the inner disease is not cured." –Atmasiddhi.
On the contrary, those who are Bhava-abhinandi are ineligible. Those who are attached to the world, who hail Bhava, who are attached to objects, are ineligible.

Even a Bhava-abhinandi, who desires to attain liberation, cannot attain it. Moreover, as stated in the Gabindu, a Bhava-abhinandi being hungry for worldly gains and recognition, sits in the "Lokapankti," meaning he performs virtuous actions with a tainted mind to please worldly desires. This leads him to a disastrous and irreversible outcome. Because, to deceive the world and gain worldly benefits, the Bhava-abhinandi uses even Dharma-kriya (righteous actions), which are meant to be performed solely for the sake of the soul, for worldly purposes. He uses such great Dharma-kriya for trivial worldly gains like honor, worship, and respect, thus degrading it and ultimately insulting it. He then expects liberation. Such Lokapankti, which is driven by worldly desires, and Atma-kalyan (self-liberation), which is driven by the soul's true purpose, can never meet. And if we think about it from the ultimate perspective, the value of worldly gains compared to the soul's true purpose, which is liberation, is like a grain of sand compared to the vast ocean. Yet, it is a great wonder that a Bhava-abhinandi, for the sake of a fleeting, imagined benefit in this life, considers the infinite suffering of future lives as insignificant, thus living up to his name!

Similarly, those who are driven by desires for worldly gains and worship, yet speak of knowledge and "detached yoga," are like scholars without wisdom. As stated by Haribhadrasuri in the Gabindu, just as worldly possessions like children and spouses are the "samsara" (cycle of birth and death) for the ignorant, "Shastra-samsara" (cycle of knowledge) is the samsara for scholars without wisdom. Thus, whether ignorant or learned, those who cherish worldly suffering and whose hearts are filled with desires for worship, how can such Bhava-abhinandi be eligible to hear the path of liberation?

"Those who hear the path of liberation, let their minds be steadfast and unwavering. Those who are attached to worldly desires, their hearts are filled with the suffering of future lives."

"I have tried endlessly to deceive the world, but I have not succeeded. Because the cycle of birth and death and its causes are still evident. The suffering of one life will be eliminated, but it will be replaced by the suffering of countless future lives. I speak with humility, and this is my endeavor." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

"Infinite love, through which the world is illuminated, is the ultimate truth. It is the essence of the Supreme Being, and it reveals the unity of all beings." - Shri Devchandraji

*"For the sake of worldly gains, with a tainted mind, virtuous actions are performed, and this is called Lokapankti.
A Bhava-abhinandi, with a low view of great Dharma-kriya, uses it for worldly gains, and wise people know this."*

*"Worldly possessions like children and spouses are the samsara for the ignorant. For those without wisdom, the cycle of knowledge is their samsara."* 

Page #21:

## Translation:

20. The meaning is that only those who desire liberation from the cycle of birth and death can achieve it. How can those who desire bondage be liberated? Those who desire liberation, the *mumukṣu*, will serve this *mekṣamārga*, the path of liberation, and the path of yoga, and it will lead them to the right result. But if someone truly does not desire liberation and, like a fly trapped in a web, desires to be bound in the cycle of birth and death, whether they are learned or unlearned, such a *bha vābhīnandī* being, if they attempt to practice yoga, it will lead them to a contrary result, like food mixed with poison. Because their mind is filled with *viṣaya vikāra*, negative mental modifications, and their inner nature is rooted in *pariṇati vṛtti vibhāva*, the state of constant change, their results will be contrary. Therefore, even yoga becomes *ayoga* for them. Thus, the practice of yoga by a *bha vābhīnandī* is also unsuccessful, and because their knowledge is based on *vāsit bodha*, false knowledge, they are bound by ignorance. Therefore, since all the efforts of a *bha vābhīnandī* are unsuccessful, they are called *niṣphala ārambhī* in this text.

"The yoga of the mind that is filled with *viṣaya vikāra*, leads to contrary results, and for them, yoga becomes *ayoga*." - Śrīmad Rājacandra

"The *dravya*, *kriyā*, *sādhana*, and *vidhi* are all described in the Jaina scriptures. Those who are rooted in *pariṇati vṛtti vibhāva* will find the truth." - Śrī Devacandraji

Thus, it is established that *mokṣa* is the goal of this text, and its primary character is the *mumukṣu*. There is no difference in this regard in any school of yoga philosophy. But as stated in the *Gabindu*, we must diligently search with self-interest to determine whether the goal of this yoga is truly *sat*, pure, in terms of its object, form, and fruit, and whether the practices are pure. Purity means: (1) First, we must investigate the true nature of the soul, the object of this yoga, the one with whom all these yogic practices are related. The soul must be understood in its true, pure form, as it is. If the soul is considered to be merely impermanent and changing, or merely eternal and unchanging, then the path of yoga is not possible. Only if the soul is considered to be both eternal and changing is the path of yoga possible. Thus, we must ensure the purity of the object. (2) We must also investigate whether the means of yoga that we wish to practice are truly *sat*, pure. In other words, we must examine whether these practices are truly conducive to the liberation of the soul.

* "The petty, greedy, fearful, deceitful, and ignorant, who are attached to the cycle of birth and death, are engaged in fruitless endeavors. Their knowledge, tainted by false results, is not beautiful. They are like food mixed with poison, and they are bound by the laws of karma."
* "The goal of yoga is liberation, and there is no difference in this regard anywhere.

(3) Is this *chog* pure? In other words, what is the true nature of the pure fruit in the form of *meksha*? And is this *yag* pure, leading to *atmasiddhi* in the form of *sal* and *samapa*? This should be examined. Thus, the three types of *yagshuddhi* - *sadhya*, *sadhana*, and *siddhi* - must be observed here. Because, keeping the true *sadhya* in mind, serving the true *sadhana*, leads to true *siddhi*; keeping the pure *atmaswaroop* as the constant goal, serving the pure *atmasadhana*, leads to pure *atmasiddhi*. In other words, by achieving the *av'chak* *chog-chogav'chak* of the true *atmaswaroop*, performing the *av'chak* *yogakriya-kriyav'chak* that is conducive to the *atmaswaroop*, one attains the *av'chak* *ful-felav'chak* in the form of pure *atmasiddhi*. From this, it is concluded that for the soul who desires to perform *chogsadhana*, the practitioner must necessarily investigate whether the *sadhana* we are serving is truly conducive to *moksha*? Does it lead to the desired *atmasiddhi* in the form of the *sadhya* at the center? Are these *chog-kriya-kul* of mine not becoming empty, like a mine without a goal, missing the *sadhya* target? Does it remain *av'chak*?
Thus, only that *yag* which is endowed with *gacharsuddhi*, *swaroopsuddhi*, and *lasuddhi* has its true *mokshahetupanam*. If this is accepted, then there is no difference in the *chogshastra* of any *darshan* in *yagmag*. Because, there is no difference in the true *sadhya* in the form of the pure *atma*, there is no difference in the *sadhana* in the form of *shamparayan* *mokshamana*, and there is no difference in the *siddhi* in the form of the pure *atmisiddhi* - *meksha*, and therefore, there is no difference in all the *munimukhus* who are dedicated to achieving *atmasiddhi*. There may be differences in names, etc., but this does not create any difference in the *chog*’s *parama*. And thus, only that *yag* where the purity of the true *sadhya*, *sadhana*, and *siddhi* exists is the true *chog* - the real *chog*; and in it alone, the true characteristic of *yag* in the form of *mokshahetupanam* - *mokshelan cholanar yo* - is truly present. This *samyak* purity, where the aforementioned characteristics of *chog* are present, is the true touchstone of *yag*, and the other definitions of *chog* also have this as their foundation. Keeping this in mind, let us now examine the other definitions.
3. Examination and Reconciliation of Various *Chog* Definitions.
(1) All Pure *Dharmavyapar* is *Chog*
“All *dharmavyapar* that is pure due to its connection with *moksha* is *yag*” - this is the definition of *yag* given by Shri Haribhadrasuriji in Shri *Chogvishika*, which is also concluded from the

This is it. Dharma is the nature of things, "Valluraavo Gamo" according to this great profound sutra, the nature of the soul is its Atmadharma. Such pure, all-pervading pure Atmasvabhavaroop Dharma + activity-action-conduct is Yoga. The soul's conduct in the pure vision-knowledge-filled nature of the father is the true Dharma, it is the character, and it is the Yoga. This Atmadharma is inherent to the soul, it is eternal, it is everlasting, it is trikalaabadhit. This is the true "Sanatan Dharma". Jina Dharma is its synonym, because the pure soul that has attained the pure inherent nature, its true name is "Jin" meaning the Vitrag Prabhu. And such Jin-Vitrag's-pure soul's Dharma is the Jina Dharma or Atmadharma. This eternal Atmadharma, the conduct in one's own nature, is the soul's "Swadharma"-Swasamay, and conduct in other influences-divisions, different from the soul, is "Paradharma"-Parsamay. It is better to die in this "Swadharma" which is the nature of the soul, but "Paradharma" which is conduct in other influences is truly "fearful"! "Vadh Nidhanam Yah Paradharmo Machav:".

Everyone in the world wanders around doing Dharma, but they don't know Dharma; after taking refuge in the feet of Jineshwar, no one binds themselves to karma. The experience of the pure soul is always, it is the enjoyment of Swasamay,
The shadow that falls from the other, it is the dwelling of Parsamay." Shri Anandghanji. This Dharma resides in the soul of the father and it is to be manifested-revealed from it, or this soul itself is Dharma, they don't understand this simple straightforward thing, and they wander around with firmness in Dharma in other's homes, but they don't see that Dharma is in the father's home and they behave like the musk deer! This Dharmamoorti, the soul-like "Param Nidhan Pragat Mukh Aagal" is revealed, they have gone out in search of it, violating it!

You wander around doing Dharma in other's homes, there is no Dharma in your own home! Just like the musk deer doesn't know, the musk deer's fragrance is its essence." Shri Yashovijayji. "Param Nidhan Pragat Mukh Aagal, the world violates it! Without caste, see! Jagdish's, the blind flee!" Shri Anandghanji.

Just as purity is the nature of the crystal, it is its Dharma, similarly, the purity of the absence of passions is the pure nature of the soul, it is the soul's Dharma. Meaning,
+"Mukkhan Joyanaao Jogo Sambo Vi Dhammavaavaro. Parishuddho Vinego, Kaalarunaago Vishele II"

The pure soul is the only religion, self-purification is the only religion, therefore the opposite is irreligion. But just as a crystal gem, though inherently pure, becomes covered with an overlay due to external impurities like a red flower, similarly, the purity of the soul is obscured by the generation of raga-shreshtha-mahadi-vibhav, resulting from external impurities in the form of karma. When these impurities are removed, just as the crystal shines in its own pure, natural form, similarly, when raga-adi-vibhav impurities are removed, the soul shines in its own pure, natural form. The soul's pure, inherent nature is always present, unaffected by the three times (past, present, future), it is simply revealed when the covering is removed. Thus, the extent to which the covering is removed, the vibhav impurities are eliminated, and the state of being free from impurities is attained, to that extent the attainment of this soul-religion is achieved. And this state of being free from impurities manifests progressively, starting from the state of samyag-darshan and culminating in liberation. Therefore, this process of revealing the pure soul-nature is the essence of all pure religious practices, this definition is completely true.

Just as purity is the nature of the crystal, so is it the nature of the soul; just as the Jina-Vira illuminates the religion, so is the absence of strong passions. The extent to which Shri Simandhar is free from impurities, that is the religion; from the state of samyag-darshan, one attains liberation. - Shri Yashovijayaji.

"The way the soul attains its own nature is the way of religion. The way the soul attains another nature is the way of something else, not the way of religion." - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 329. (43)

The five-fold yoga, as described in Jain scriptures, is a shining example of this pure religious practice, where the main definition "the union with liberation" truly applies. This yoga, with its five stages, is described as adhyaya, bhavana, dhyana, samata, and vritti-kshaya, progressively becoming more excellent (see Babindu 358-367).

The action that is done with one's own nature is called adhyatma, the action that is done with another's nature is not called adhyatma... Shri Shreyansak's name is adhyatma, the essence of dhyana, the essence of dravya is adhyatma; the essence of bhavana is with one's own qualities, that is firm. - Shri Anandghanaji.

(2) The suppression of mental activities is yoga, according to the sage Patanjali, this definition also points to the same purpose, because when mental activities are suppressed...

**In the form of**

**Position**

**Dhyana** (of the Purusha-Atma) is to be understood as **Vedavasthanam** (Pa. Che.). Thus, this explanation also confirms the previous one. This explanation aims to include **Samprajñata** and **Asamprajñata** and **Samadhi** in the definition of **Yoga**. As mentioned earlier, the five types of **Yoga** according to Jain scriptures, this **Samprajñata** and **Asamprajñata** and **Samadhi** are easily attained in the fifth type, **Vrittikshaya**. These **Vrittis** are the activities of the Atma, which are **sthula** and **sukshma**. Their main purpose is to **karsha** (to attract) the **sache** (right) **gyan** (knowledge). The **Vrittikshaya** is the complete eradication of these **karsha** and **aksarsha** (attraction and repulsion) through **akarna niyam** (non-attachment). This specific **Vrittikshaya** occurs in the first two types of **Shuddhyana**, where **Samprajñata Samadhi** is attained, because there is **gyan** (knowledge) of the **Vritti** in the form of **samyak karsha**. The attainment of **kevalgyan** at the end of the **kshapka shreni** (series of karmas) is **Asamprajñata Samadhi**, because there is an absence of **samyak gyan** due to the **avagraha** (non-grasping) of the **bhavanavritti** (thought-waves) which have the nature of **graha** (grasping) and **grahana** (acceptance). 

Thus, this definition of **Yoga** from Patanjali aligns with the Jain definition. Not only that, but there is also a surprising similarity in some of the technical terms! The definition mentioned in the Gita, **"Samahan Yoga Uchyate"**, also aligns with the fourth type of **Yoga**, **Samata Yoga**.

The process of **Yoga** is as follows: When the **chitta** (mind) becomes **kshinavritti** (with diminished **Vrittis**), then the **parmatmaswaroop** (true nature of the soul) is attained. **Samapatti** (attainment) means **sparshan** (touching) through **dhyan** (meditation). The **sparshan** (touching) of the form of that which is being meditated upon, the **samyak aapatti** (attainment) of its form, becoming like that, is **samapatti**. Like a crystal... the **nil chitta ratna** (pure mind) reflects the image of that which it meditates upon. Because when the **chitta** becomes **nilkshanu** (without **Vrittis**), **paradarshak** (transparent), **swachchh** (pure) like a crystal, then it becomes **sthira** (stable) and **ekagrapashu** (focused) because it does not run towards other **Vrittis**. And when it is...

For more details, see **Shri Haridrasurisकृत Yagabindu** and the **Param Samviveka** commentary on **Patanjal Yoga Sutras** by **Shri Yovijayaji**. In these works, these great souls have shown the **vikramta** (excellence) of the definition of **Yoga** from **Patanjal Sutras** and have shown its **samanyava** (alignment) with **Jain Shastras** with their **gunamadi** (virtuous) and **vishal drishti** (broad vision). They have introduced us to their **kushatramudda** (skillful intellect) and **mahanubhav udarata** (greatness and generosity).

* **"Vitarkavicharananda smitaroopānugamātsambhajnataḥ |"** (Pa. Su.) This can be compared to the names of **Shukladhyan** (white meditation): (1) **Prithvitark** (earth-thought), (2) **Ekatvavitarak** (one-thought), etc.

'
When one attains one-pointedness, then only does one attain the state of being absorbed in the object of contemplation. When the mind becomes pure, it becomes steady, and when it becomes steady, it becomes absorbed in the object of contemplation, and only then does liberation occur. Abandoning the outward-looking attitude, one attains the inward-looking attitude, and with a steady mind, one contemplates, "The soul is the Supreme Soul." This contemplation becomes a reflection of the Supreme Soul in the mirror of the pure, unchanging mind, and liberation occurs. Thus, the process of liberation is: cessation of mental activities → liberation, spiritual grace → knowledge of the truth → the state of being beyond knowledge → liberation, the process of yoga.

Abandon the outward-looking attitude, attain the inward-looking attitude, become steady in the form of the Supreme Soul. Contemplate the Supreme Soul, surrender to the Supreme Soul. With a pure mind, surrender to the Supreme Soul, like a mirror, unchanging. '' Shri Anandghanji.

In Jain scriptures, the term 'eight yogas' is used for mind, speech, and body, which is indicative and conveys the same meaning. Similarly, 'usage' is a special term in Jain terminology. This usage is divided into two types: usage of knowledge and usage of action. 'Thirty-five yogas are essential' (Tattvartha Sutra). These eight yogas are closely related to each other. When the soul becomes steady in the state of pure knowledge and vision, its mind, speech, and body are steady, and when the mind, speech, and body are steady, the soul's instability is removed, and the usage also becomes steady.
The soul, in the form of usage, is in a state of being united with this body like milk and water, but it is different from the body like a sword from its sheath. How to attain it? How to make the usage not cease? Through the right yoga of mind, speech, and body. To practice such right yoga of mind, speech, and body, to demonstrate such skill, so that the soul does not become an obstacle in its self-realization but becomes a facilitator. 'Four: The skill of the mind' (Gita). And the method for this is to make the usage of mind, speech, and body so concise that the soul's form is primarily steady in relation to the body; and this steadiness of the soul is such that it does not end due to fear of any kind of danger or attack. Thus, to perfect, to shorten the usage of mind, speech, and body, they are given the names of mind-secrecy, speech-secrecy, and body-secrecy in Jain terminology. The usage of mind, speech, and body

To protect this skillful secrecy, to maintain effort, so that the soul, which is the object of use, becomes stable within its own form, becomes 'form-secret'. Now, as long as there is a body, there will be some activity of the mind, speech, and body. So how should it be done so that it does not affect the stability of the soul?

(4) Mental stability-Chittasamadhi, that yoga or steadiness, is also a definition of yoga. Because the meaning of the root word "yuuj" is to attain samadhi. Therefore, Chittasamadhi-mental stability is yoga. This is also true. As long as the thoughts of the mind wander here and there, the mind will not become stable, and until it becomes stable, it will not attain samadhi-self-absorption. When the mind becomes pure, it becomes stable, and when it becomes stable, it attains samadhi-self-absorption. In this yoga, conquering the mind, controlling the mind, is the main thing. This mind is truly "difficult to control, difficult to please-to subdue." The Gita says, "This fickle mind is restless and extremely powerful. It is very difficult to control it like the wind." The tricks of this mind-monkey are heavy! This "mind" is neuter, but it beats-pushes all men! On the other hand, it is "masculine" and capable, but this mind cannot be controlled by anything!
"The mind does not stop, O Kunthujin! The mind does not stop; as much as I try to keep it, it runs away. Kunthujin! I have known that it is neuter, it takes all men; on the other hand, the man is capable, but it cannot be controlled by anything." - Shri Anandghanji.
To subdue this mind-monkey, first it should be tied somewhere or given some work to do, so that this poor monkey can climb up and down! For example, the one who has conquered his mind, the Supreme Being, the Vitarag Prabhu, should be tied to the pillar of his feet with the chain of love, so that this child cannot move around. Or, let it loose to play in the Shruta-Skandha, so that it can climb up and down in it! Let it eat as much as it wants of the fruit of the soul! Let it pick the leaves of the vow! Let it swing on the branches of the knowledge! Let it dance and jump in the vast root part! Or, as Shri Pujyapadaswami has shown the easy and best method of mind-samadhi in Samadhishatak, it is this: "Separate the soul from the mind with speech and body, and abandon the actions of speech and body with the mind." etc. By the power of detachment-study

This adorable mind, which brings it to the 'place' where it is stable, connects it to the place of the soul, it cultivates this mind, and the mind is cultivated. It has cultivated everything. 'Thus, as the shadow merges in the vast expanse, so the soul attains samatva and enters its own nature, meaning the form of the mind also disappears, i.e., the citta attains samadhi, merging into the soul.

II The subject of this Chaugdashtasamucchya Shastra. 1. General guidance on Yagdashtin
'The ultimate cause and the ultimate result, the culmination of existence;
Faults disappear and vision opens, O Bhatti, the attainment of the teachings of the scriptures.' — Shri Anandghanji.
', '
Thus, here, generally, in the form of a foundation, having discussed the meaning of Yag, now we come to the subject of this Yagdashtasamucchya Shastra: — At the beginning of this text, in the form of an introduction, the ultimate heart-touching, interesting, and enlightening form of Ichchhayag, Shastrachhayag, and Samyag, which are described as having the purpose of liberation, has been mentioned. Without repeating it here, I recommend that the intelligent seeker should look at the entire introductory chapter (R, 12). Without directly relying on this triad of Ichchhayag, etc., especially the Chaugdashtin arising from them, is mentioned here: Mitra, Tara, Ala, Dipr, Stira, Kanta, Prabha, Pan. These are the true names of Chaugdashtin. For example, Mitra is the one who has a feeling of friendship towards the entire world, etc. To understand how these Yags are differentiated, an example of Chaugdashtin has been presented."
'I am dense and solid in the day, empty, weak, and bewildered;
Just as the eyes see differently, so are the different perspectives of Chaugdashtin.' — Ya. Sajjay,
Thus, even in the vision of a single worldly scene, just as different perspectives of Chaugdashtin arise due to the difference in the object of vision, food, and livelihood, so too in the transcendental realm, due to the peculiarity of the state of being, there are different types of attainment, different types of perception, and different types of knowledge. Just as the diaphragm of a camera opens less, so the field of vision increases or decreases; similarly, depending on the increase or decrease in the state of being, the more the covering is removed, the more the doors are opened, the less the knowledge is received by the person with Chaugdashtin.

The worldly vision of the worldly objects, which is the common vision of the layman, who is carried away by the flow of the world and who welcomes the world, is called **Oghdristi** (Vision of a layman); and the divine vision of the non-worldly objects, which is the divine vision of the liberated soul, the **Mumukṣu** with **Samyagdṛṣṭi**, is called **Gadṛṣṭi** (Vision of Yogi).

The method of **Oghdṛṣṭi** is worldly, practical, flowing, following the past, like the flow of a herd of cattle, and is according to the world; the method of **Gadṛṣṭi** is non-worldly, transcendental, according to the path of liberation, and is knowledge-seeking. Due to the peculiarity of the destruction of the **Kṣaya**, there is a difference in vision, which the **Oghdṛṣṭi** and the **Mithyāṣṭi** people argue about, but the **Samyagdṛṣṭi** **Gīpuruṣa** with **Yogadṛṣṭi** does not argue about it, this difference in vision does not reside in the minds of the great souls, they do not get carried away by the insistence of opinions and visions like the ordinary people. They see only one path of liberation, only **Yogadṛṣṭi**, only **Ātmadṛṣṭi**. All these visions are encompassed in the root of the one **Ātmatattva**, only the "**Dṛṣṭi**" is different, they believe this with a true heart. They know the six visions as parts of **Jīnādṛṣṭi** or as parts of pure **Ātmadṛṣṭi**, so they do not get involved in the debate of refutation and affirmation, on the contrary, they worship the six visions as relatives of the soul with **Samyagdṛṣṭi**. Because they are aware of the true limits of small expectations, they know how to divide the **Naya** appropriately, so these impartial, non-violent **Samyagdṛṣṭi** men with the ultimate liberal and **anekānta** vision, do not examine these visions in the middle, they see these visions as one **Jīnādṛṣṭi** or as parts of pure, **Ātmadṛṣṭi** man.

"Different opinions are seen, different visions are seen; in the root of one principle, all are encompassed, believe that." - **Śrīmad Rājacandrajī**. "The six visions are like the limbs of the **Jīn**, the **Naya** is the means with which they are connected; the devotees of the **Nami Jīnavara** worship the six visions." - **Śrī Ānandghanajī**

Similarly, the activities of these **Samyagdṛṣṭi** saints, who are pure, wise, non-violent, compassionate, etc., and who are inspired by compassion and have a very deep and liberal intention, are also for the sake of others, so these **Avadhūta** "impartial, rare ones" remain neutral to all visions, and remain absorbed in their own nature, and serve the pure purpose of guiding all beings to the right path with the "**Sanjīvanīcāra Nyāya**" which is beneficial to all.

This yogi, with pure selfless love that benefits both the soul and other souls, performs actions that are supremely blessed.
“All the visions of the world are embraced by the vision of the self, and it remains in its own nature. It is the life-giving force for all beings, and it nourishes all.” - Yo. Sajjay.
This Radudristi vision is of eight types. To explain it clearly, this analogy has been given, which makes the meaning of this vision easily understandable. These eight visions are (1) the vision of the fire of grass, (2) the vision of the fire of dung, (3) the vision of the fire of wood, (4) the vision of the light of a lamp, (5) the vision of the light of a gem, (6) the vision of the light of a star, (7) the vision of the light of the sun, and (8) the vision of the light of the moon. From the fire of grass to the light of the moon, there is an increasing intensity of light. Similarly, from the vision of a friend to the vision of the supreme, there is an increasing intensity of the light of knowledge. The author has explained how this analogy applies perfectly to each vision (see pp. 63-64). The great and powerful seer, Shrimad Rajchandraji, has compared this vision to a thermometer, which is also a very appropriate analogy. Just as a thermometer can measure the heat of the body, this vision can measure the spiritual progress of the soul, the state of the soul, and the level of the soul's qualities. The fourteen Gunasthanas are a well-known measure of the soul's development of qualities, and this development depends on the decrease of attachment. As the darkness of attachment decreases, the Gunasthanas increase. Similarly, this vision is also a measure of spiritual development, and it depends on the opening of the vision of knowledge. As the light of knowledge increases, the quality of the soul increases. These two are like two sides of the same coin. The decrease of attachment is the yardstick of the Gunasthanas, and the light of knowledge is the yardstick of the yogic vision. By observing the characteristics of this vision, a seeker can measure the state of their soul and receive inspiration to work for the development of qualities they have not yet attained and to maintain the qualities they have attained. Thus, this vision becomes a source of supreme nectar for the soul.
The first four visions correspond to the first Gunasthanaka, which is called "Nirupcharit." This Gunasthanaka is attained through the vision of the fire of grass, the vision of the fire of dung, the vision of the fire of wood, and the vision of the light of a lamp. Here...

‘Gunasthan’ means to understand the meaning of the true place of the qualities. It means that in the four perspectives of Mitra, etc., the proportion of Mithyatva decreases progressively, and therefore the proportion of the qualities that arise increases. After that, from the fifth perspective of Sthira, there is no Mithyatva, only Samyag Darshan. The Samyag Darshan in the fifth perspective, like the Medha Prakash Ratna Prabha, is stable, which is why it is rightly called ‘Sthira’. This Samyag Darshan Ratna Deepak has manifested in the temple of my mind, and the enemy of darkness is destroyed! The destruction of all darkness! And the brilliance of experience! The lamp of Samyag Darshan Ratna has been lit, it will never be extinguished! Not only that, but its brilliance, its radiance, and its peak, like the stars, the sun, and the moon, increase progressively, becoming more stable and more powerful!
“Sahelaan hai kuchh Jineshwar Dev! Ratna Deepak ati pata hai laal; Sa. Muj man darmahi, aave jo abil jipta hai. Laal, Sa. Mite te meh andhaar, anubhav teje jhalhale ho laal,
Sa. Dhum kshaya na rek, charan chitramnu nav chale hai. Laal.”—Shri Yashovijayji.
Thus, although the first four perspectives of Mitra, etc., are Mithyatva, why are they considered Sad-Dristi-Samyag Dristi? The solution is that the four perspectives of Mitra, etc., are the cause of the Amegh-Achuk of the Sabhyashti. Therefore, due to the effect in the cause, Mitra, etc., are also considered Samyag Dristi. To understand this, there is the example of the making of pure sugar from sugarcane: To reach the state of pure sugar (Refined crystallised sugar), one has to go through all the processes (Various processes) from sugarcane to pure sugar, only then can the production of granulated sugar take place. Similarly, for pure Atma Siddhi, the stages of gradual growth of the soul, like Mitra, etc., are also useful in thirteen ways, because they are the cause of Samyag Dristi. This Mitra, etc., state is truly like Itu, etc., because it results in the nectar-like sweetness of the supreme Samaveg. Therefore, those who are not like Itu, etc., are like the false, and therefore they never experience Samaveg, and they are all eager to attain the perspective of Mitra, etc. And on the other hand, even those who are Bhajya, until they experience Samaveg, the perspective of Mitra, etc., does not manifest; when they are dyed with Samaveg, only then does the perspective of Mitra, etc., manifest.
*
This perspective is consistent with all the teachings of the Chek-ing-dana. From the beginning, with the removal of the obstacles, the perspective of the Chek-ing-dana, which is full of Cheg, is consistent with the perspective of the Muni (Patanjali, etc.), who are the place of the qualities of Advesha, etc., in order. This is the eight perspectives! Here, in order, are Yama, Niyama, Asana, 


Page #33:
---------------------------
The text describes the eight limbs of yoga (Ashtanga Yoga) and their alignment with the eight yogic insights (Yogadristi). It explains that the first limb of yoga, Yama, corresponds to the first insight, Mitra Dristi, and so on. 

The text then lists eight mental afflictions (Chittadosha) that need to be overcome to attain the eight limbs and insights. These afflictions are: Khed (sorrow), Udveg (anxiety), Shep (greed), Utthan (arrogance), Bhrānti (delusion), Anyamud (attachment to others), Run (anger), and Asang (attachment). 

The text further explains that these eight insights are the foundation for eight virtues: Advesha (non-hatred), Jijñāsā (curiosity), Shushrusha (service), Shravan (listening), Bedha (understanding), Mimānsā (reflection), Pratipatti (realization), and Pravritti (action). 

The text emphasizes that these insights (Dristi) are like a vision that gradually unfolds, similar to how the physical eye opens and expands its field of vision. As the yogic vision (Yogadristi) develops, it reveals more and more of the truth, ultimately leading to complete enlightenment. 

The text also clarifies the meaning of the term "Dristi" as a true understanding (Bedha) that arises from the abandonment of false actions (Asatupravritti) and leads to the path of righteous actions (Sat Pravritti). It emphasizes that this understanding must be based on true faith (Satshrddha) and not on false beliefs (Asat Shrddha). 

Finally, the text compares the individual who lacks true faith to a person with eye disease, highlighting the importance of true understanding and the dangers of false beliefs. 

Page #34:
---------------------------
33
If a person with divine yogadristi, a discerning expert (Expert) in all types of medicine, is found, he will correctly diagnose the color of the eye and provide appropriate treatment. By applying the ointment of knowledge, the person's vision will gradually improve, the divine eye will open, and the eye disease will completely disappear. But if, by mistake, one encounters a blind quack, he will tear out the eye and create a situation like "half-blind".

This faith-based knowledge-illuminated yogadristi activity stops, and the sattvaprakruti state comes closer. The vaidya (doctor) and vaidya pad (self-realization, samyagdarshan) or yogadristi are both sattvaprakruti-related. Here, the word "avahu" (to bring) is very significant. Like a leech, the attraction of this yogadristi is so powerful that it draws the "padma" (makshapada) closer and closer. Once this yogadristi, the "divine eye", is touched, it's over! By the touch of this parashmani (touchstone) of vision, the iron of the body becomes pure gold!

It is said that the first four dristi (vision) - mitra, etc. - are either pratipati (receding) or apratipati (non-receding) in this mahamahimavan (greatly glorious) yogadristi. But the last four dristi - sthira, etc. - are always apratipati. This is the rule. The first four dristi, if they are pratipati, they recede and go back, and they can also lead to sapaach-naraka (hell) etc. If they are not pratipati, they do not recede after coming, and they do not lead to naridu:kha (suffering) etc. Therefore, when sthira, etc. dristi, which are not pratipati, are attained, the journey towards liberation continues uninterruptedly, and liberation is eventually attained.

The asat (non-being) sapravritti pad (state of activity) of the jiva (soul) is the shaileshi pad (state of being like a mountain). This
66
"In the four dristi, etc., the journey towards liberation does not break.
Like the sun's rays, it removes all suffering, and it gives happiness to both gods and humans." - Shri Che. Sajay.

Here, the form is a lotus with eight petals. This yogadristi is its petals, and the place where the petals meet is the yogakarnica, which is the nature of the self. In this karnica, which is the nature of the self, the Bhagavan (Lord) Atma-chaitanya (consciousness of the soul) Dev Parbrahma (Supreme Brahman) resides. As the yogadristi petals develop, the yogakamal (lotus of yoga) also develops. With the opening of each yogarupa (yoga-related) petal, one chittadoosha (mental defect) is eliminated, one guna (quality) develops, and one yoganga (limb of yoga) is revealed. Thus, as yogadristi unfolds, the yogarupa kamal (lotus of yoga) reaches full bloom.

The mitra dristi is like a spark of fire! The development of yogadristi, which began with this spark of light, continues to grow, and in the pada dristi, it blooms fully like a full moon. 

Page #35:

This young lotus, which has blossomed as if it has witnessed the gentle sight of the full, moon-like, knowledge-named world-illuminating, perfect,  *bedha-chandra*, appears to have attained full bloom! (See the figure on the front page.)
“Like the moon, the *gadashti* opens gradually;
Attaining full *yoga-kala*, it plays in the form of God.” – *Gadashtikalash* (self-composed) or *Garupurusha* is the one who has eight *gangas* as his eight limbs. Among them, *yama-niyama* are the two feet, *asana-pranayama* are the two hands, *pratyahara* is the abdomen, *dharana* is the chest, *dhyana* is the neck, and *samadhi* is the head. The fullness and non-duality of these eight limbs is the non-dual fullness of the *Garupurusha*, just as it is for a man with non-dual, complete limbs. Any deficiency or incompleteness in even one limb is a deficiency or incompleteness of the *Garupurusha*, just as it is for a man with a deficient limb, a cripple. Just as each limb in the human body has its proper place and usefulness, so too does each *ganga* in this *yoga-sharira* have its proper place and usefulness. Just as all the limbs and parts of the body work together in coordination to perform all the actions related to the body, so too do all the limbs of the *Garupurusha* work together in coordination (organic unit) to perform the actions of a *yoga-purusha*. Just as air is the body and the body and breath are one, so too is the soul the *Garupurusha* and the *gangas* are its essence. As the *gadashti* develops and each *ganga* manifests and becomes stronger, the soul becomes more and more established in its nature. When the eighth *gadashti* develops, the eight-limbed *yogapurusha* attains its peak development and the soul is fully active in its nature.
“The eighth *gadashti* is the essence of *samadhi*, its name is ‘*para*’ I know;
Its nature is fully active, like the moon, I praise it twice.” – Shri K.D. Saxena.
And thus, when the moon-like *gadashti* blooms in full bloom and the *Garupurusha* attains full development, the fullness of the *gachakra* leads to the “fullness” of this *bhavachakra*, that is, the end of this *bhavachakra*. The eight *gangas* are the spokes of this *gachakra*, they are closely connected to the *gana* which is the form of the soul, and they revolve around it, that is, they are active as the instruments of the soul’s nature. This *gachakra* is truly the invincible “*Sudarshan Chakra*” that raises the *bhavachakra*. This pure “*Dharmachakra*” that destroys the enemy of *bhavachakra* is called “*Arihant*” by the true name of the supreme *cheminath* who creates it, and by attaining the state of the soul, he makes the name “*Siddha*” meaningful.

Here, on the title page, by glancing at the main figure of this book, the wise reader will understand the complete subject of this book at first glance. Also, for the convenience of the inquisitive student, I have planned 21 other figures and 16 tables in their respective places, which will also be of some use to him.

## 2. Gabij: The Importance of Bhakti Yoga.
"जिनेषु कुशलं चित्तं तन्नमस्कार एव च । gTIમાઃિ ૫ સંગુઠું નવીનમનુત્તમ ” - Shri Haribhadracharya.
"जो जाणइ अरिहंते, दव्वगुणपज्जवेहि य ।। સો નાઇનિર પ્રણા, મોરે ૩ વાર તરસ ત્રયં ” - Shri Kundakundaacharya.

And this path is primarily based on devotion, as is indicated here by the special description of Gabij, which the sage, the author of this scripture, has called the foundation of the first friend's vision. This gives rise to some thought on this occasion. Prabhubhakti, Sadgurubhakti, Samrutbhakti, Sahaja Bhairagya, etc. are called the best Gabij here, which become the infallible means of Nirvana. These Amegh Gabij, projected in the mind of the seeker, sprout and successively give the fruit of the supreme nectar, which is liberation. And that

The first and foremost seed in Gabij is the supreme seed, the devotion to the supreme self, Shri Jinendra, the Vitaraga Deva. "To have a mind filled with good and auspicious feelings towards Shri Jin Bhagwan, to offer salutations and pure reverence, is the best Gabij." By establishing the Siddha Atma, who has attained liberation, the pure nature of the supreme Lord, in the ideal place, and by performing his single-minded worship, it becomes the main Gabij, there is no doubt about it. The example of a lion cub living in a flock of sheep for a long time is relevant here. By seeing the form of the Lord, the devotee becomes aware of his own form, and thinks, "How good it would be if I could manifest such a pure Atma form, full of bliss, like Jin Bhagwan?" With such an intense desire, which is a deep-seated taste, he becomes a pure, selfless soul in the end, turns towards self-realization, and practices the ideal form of the supreme self. The achievement is like the ideal that is worshipped. Just as a skilled sculptor, keeping the model constantly in front of his eyes, creates a work of art, so too the seeker, keeping the pure consciousness, the Lord, who is the ideal form of the established deity, constantly in front of his eyes, creates the complete artistic manifestation of his own self. But he sees his own form in the mirror of the unchanging form of the Lord.

The verse states that the pure devotion (Chegkhīj) is the devotion that is offered to the Jina Raja (the victorious one) with the feeling of a seeker, experiencing the state of Devchandra (the moon god) and the pure radiance. Shri Devchandraji here refers to pure devotion, not impure devotion. Shri Haribhadrasuriji says that we are talking about serving this extraordinary Lord in an extraordinary way. We are talking about serving this transcendental Lord by knowing and understanding the profound secrets and mysteries of his service, and by offering service that is a manifestation of spiritual qualities. Many beings serve this transcendental Lord in a worldly way without understanding his true nature. They serve him with the desire for worldly rewards, both in this life and the next. Or they serve him with the ten karmas (vices) like anger, pride, deceit, greed, etc. This kind of service offered to a transcendental Lord with worldly desires is not pure service, and it is not Chegkhīj. Pure service is that which is offered (1) with the understanding that the Lord is the ultimate object of worship, (2) without the ten karmas, and (3) without any desire for worldly or otherworldly rewards. This kind of pure service is what is called Chegkhīj.

Therefore, (1) first and foremost, we should develop the understanding that this Vitaraga (free from attachment) Supreme Being is the most worthy of respect, worship, and adoration in the entire universe. We should consider him as the ultimate object of worship, whose glory and virtues are infinitely greater than anything else in the universe. We should consider him as the ultimate teacher, the ultimate God, the ultimate beloved. "Serve him above all else!" This means that we should be more eager to serve this compassionate ocean of virtues, the "Arhat" (worthy one), who is infinitely more glorious than any other object in the universe, than we are to serve anyone else. (2) Second, pure devotion is characterized by the absence of the ten karmas, including the desire for food, anger, etc. In pure devotion, even the desire for food is forgotten, fear disappears, lust becomes useless, attachment dies, anger is pacified, pride is extinguished, deceit is abandoned, greed is eliminated, wrong belief is replaced by true understanding, and there is no concern for worldly praise. This is the kind of pure devotion that a seeker of liberation should practice. As Shri Yovijayaji said, "When one meets the cool Jina, one's mind becomes pure." (3) Third, pure devotion should be free from any desire for worldly or otherworldly rewards. Any action performed with the desire for worldly rewards like wealth, fame, or praise, destroys the true self and becomes a poisonous action, as it is motivated by hope. Similarly, any action performed with the desire for otherworldly rewards also becomes a poisonous action, as it is motivated by fear. Therefore, we should...

Abandoning the practice of poison, which is like the deadly poison Halahala, from afar, the seeker should practice only selfless devotion with a true understanding, and should tread the path of Amrita Anushthan, which transforms the soul into the form of nectar. Such pure devotion and other practices are the means to liberation. “The path of the nectar of the qualities of the Jinas… the means to the action of the nectar of the mind… the action of the nectar of the future… the mind becomes the nectar of the soul.” – Shri Devchandraji. “It is possible, O God, to remove the dust from the heart, to obtain the service of the Lord, the service is the first step, the fearless, the infinite. The fruit of worship is said to be the joy of the mind, the worship is unbroken, without deceit, the self becomes the treasure of joy.” – Shri Anandghanji.

Others, who are deluded and confused, believe that the service of the Lord is easy, beautiful, and convenient. “They think that by performing rituals, offerings, or making donations, the Lord is pleased! But the Lord is not so easily pleased, and His service is not easy, but very difficult; because until the “deceit of the heart” of the living being is gone, there will be no love with the Lord; therefore, the seeker should, as much as possible, abandon the pursuit of worldly things and should climb the ladder of pure contemplation of the devotion of the self-realized God, that is, the form of this God is the same as the form of this great soul. Thus, with pure conviction, all beings are equal to the liberated ones, but it happens as they understand it in the right way. And the cause of this happening is the command of the true Guru, the state of the Jinas, etc. But those who abandon this unparalleled cause by taking the name of the material cause, never attain liberation and remain in delusion.

“All beings are equal to the liberated ones, it happens as they understand it; the command of the true Guru, the state of the Jinas, are the causes. Those who abandon this cause by taking the name of the material cause, never attain liberation and remain in delusion.” – Shri Atmasiddhi.

Some people talk about the material cause without understanding, and unknowingly consider the cause to be secondary and make it a subject of debate. This is due to their misunderstanding, their false delusion; because the material cause and the cause are not contradictory or opposing, but are inseparable and cooperative. Awareness and purification of the material cause is certainly a duty, and the goal of pure devotion is also the same.

It is true, but these great souls forget that for the sake of purity and awareness of the *upādāna*, it is essential to manifest the *upādāna* as the cause of the *upādāna*, and for this, the indispensable need for the dependence on the *padma* (lotus) like *jinabhakti* (devotion to the Jinas) and other beneficial causes. The service of the Lord is the strong *lakshana* (sign) that manifests the *upādāna* (soul) as the cause of the *upādāna*. The scriptural scholars have repeatedly proclaimed that the *jinarāja* (king of the Jinas), the mine of the nectar of equality, is the ultimate cause, and his dependence is the attainment of *niyama* (discipline). The great soul, *matthātmā* (great soul) *daivacandraji* (a Jain saint) and others have sung with devotion:

“The *upādāna* is the soul, O friend, the strong *lakshana* is the Lord… worship the Jinas! The *upādāna* is the cause, O friend, the service of the Lord manifests it… worship the Jinas! The *jinarāja* is the ultimate cause, the mine of the nectar of equality; the dependence on the Lord is the attainment of *niyama*, this is the proclamation.” – *Śrī Daivacandraji*.

“If the work is done due to the cause, there is no argument in that; but to say that the cause is Vishnu and to accomplish the work, is the delusion of one’s own opinion.” – *Śrī Anandghanaji*.

It is extremely difficult to ascend directly (directly) through the series of forms without such a strong dependence on the cause. But for those who have manifested the *ātmasvarūpa* (true nature of the soul), it becomes easy to ascend through that series by depending on the meditation of the *sahujātmā* (one who is the same as the soul) *aham* (I) *ta-siddh* (self-realized) Lord. Because, as *Śrīmad Rājacandraji* has said, “To contemplate the form of the Lord is to contemplate the form of the *parama dṛṣṭivān puruṣa* (the man of supreme vision) from a secondary perspective. Just as the *ātmasvarūpa* of the perfected Lord is, so is the *ātmasvarūpa* of all beings; therefore, the noble being should have an interest in perfection.” If we look at it from the fundamental perspective, the worship of the Jinas is the worship of the *ātmasvarūpa*. *Śrī Daivacandra* has said, “The worship of the Jinas is the worship of oneself.” Someone might say, “What is the use of this cause? We should directly cling to the *upādāna* soul, and only contemplate the *adhyātmasvarūpa* (spiritual form).” But this belief is wrong, because such contemplation of the *adhyātmasvarūpa* without the *lakshana* is for the excellent *adhikārī* (qualified person) who has attained the very high, un-distracted state; but without such a high state of *adhikārī*, reading the *adhyātmashastra* (spiritual scriptures) with one’s own imagination, and talking about the contemplation of the *adhyātmasvarūpa* in the name of the *upādāna*, there are many dangers. For example, sometimes it causes *vyāmoha* (delusion) in the being. Even though one has not attained such a state of *śyātmā* (self-realized), one develops a delusion of such a state, and instead of “I am Brahman,” one becomes “I am delusion!” Sometimes, due to the lack of the sweetness of *bhaktirasa* (devotional feeling), dryness sets in, and one becomes a dry spiritualist, and in speech, one acts as if one is in a state of *mahāveśa* (great trance), and thus develops a dry intellectualism, and therefore…

plays, but pure *dandachāra* (conduct)

There is a possibility of delusion or a state of madness where knowledge is not fully realized or is expressed in an incoherent manner. If the attachment to the world is not completely relinquished, if the entire world is not seen as illusory or like a dream, and if such a state of detachment and knowledge is not attained, then one may still exhibit a false sense of knowledge, claiming, "I am a knower, not a fool, how can I be liberated?" This can lead to hypocrisy, pretense, and dualistic tendencies. In this way, various flaws can arise from mere intellectual contemplation of spirituality. However, through devotion, such flaws do not arise, and the soul naturally ascends through a series of spiritual qualities.

"The great souls who aspire to their true form have recognized the worship of the Jina Bhagwan and the Siddha Bhagwan as the means to attain that form. The state of diminished attachment (Kshina-meh) is a powerful support for the soul that contemplates its true form. ... However, mere intellectual contemplation of the spiritual self can lead to confusion in some, dryness in others, or even a state of madness. Contemplation of the form of the Bhagwan leads to a devotion-oriented vision, while the spiritual vision becomes secondary. This prevents dryness, indulgence, and madness. By becoming aware of one's true self, one naturally becomes more spiritual. The soul naturally embraces higher qualities, preventing the emergence of flaws like dryness, etc. It also prevents aversion to the path of devotion. The natural state of the soul gradually merges with its true form. Here, the mind, without relying on the contemplation of forms like Arjuna, etc., embraces its true nature as the soul." - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 692, (753)

Maharshi Kundakundacharya has said in Pravachansar that one who knows the Bhagwan through his form, his visible attributes, his qualities, and his transformations, knows his own soul, and by firmly establishing this knowledge, destroys attachment. Thus, on the path of devotional spirituality or spiritual devotion, one does not fall into the aforementioned flaws. With devotion as the primary focus, one gradually ascends through higher and higher spiritual states, and through the experience of the qualities of the manifested soul, one attains a state of pure spirituality, ultimately achieving complete self-realization. Thus, the contemplation of the form of the Lord, through firm faith, is an easy and effective means, a royal path, to attain one's true form. Just as a lamp, by worshipping a lamp, becomes a lamp itself, so too, the soul, by worshipping the Supreme Soul, becomes the Supreme Soul itself. By worshipping the object of worship, the worshipper becomes the object of worship. You, my friend, will attain the blessed state sung by Maha Gita Nadghanji. You will become the Supreme Soul by knowing your own soul, just as a tree, by striving for itself, becomes a tree. You, my friend, will become the Supreme Soul by knowing your own soul, just as a tree, by striving for itself, becomes a tree.

It is possible; but this is a one-pointed path suitable for a capable yogi, and it requires the use of extraordinary strength. Even dying after struggling is difficult to attain the supreme state without the support of the manifest Supreme Self; but with the support of that Supreme Person, it becomes very easy. The world, which is like a vast ocean, becomes like a small step with the support of the Lord! Therefore, great saints like Shri Devchandraji have sung: "By clinging to the Jin, we become free from clinging and become self-reliant, therefore, we will enjoy the pure garden of our own qualities by clinging to that capable Lord." To the extent that the self-essence, endowed with its own wealth, is not complete, I will always serve the feet of this Jagguru Dev, I will not abandon his support until the end of the 12th subtle-merit quality-state.
The world, which is like a vast ocean, becomes like a small step with the support of the Lord! "By clinging to the Jin, we become free from clinging and become self-reliant, therefore, we will enjoy the pure garden of our own qualities by clinging to that capable Lord."
"Until the pure essence of our own wealth is complete,
I will always serve the feet of this Jagguru Dev." - Shri Devchandraji. Thus, devotion has been praised by all the scriptural scholars with one voice. *The Gita also says: "Of all the devotees, the one who worships Me with faith, who has attained Me in his heart, is the most dear to Me." Devotion is the royal path to liberation. "Jinpati bhakti mukti ne marg" (Devotion to the Jin is the path to liberation), says the king of devotees, Devchandraji. "Without Jin-bhaav, one cannot escape from suffering," says the supreme soul, Shrimad Rajchandraji.
While studying the ocean of scriptures, I found this essence: "Devotion to God is the seed of supreme bliss and wealth," - this is the saying of Shri Yashvijayji, who is proficient in all scriptures.*
Just as Jin-bhakti is the best seed, so is Sadguru-bhakti the best yoga seed. Shri Haribhadrasuriji says: "To have pure skillful mind, etc., towards those who are full of devotion, such as the Acharya, Upadhyaya, Sadhu, Tapasvi, etc., is the seed, - not towards the Dravyaacharya, etc." Here, the scriptural scholar emphasizes the word "bhaav" (devotion). Devotion - the one whose soul has yoga as a result of the ultimate goal. The one who is truly devoted, who is a pure self-knower and is a true guru, who has the true ideal qualities of devotion as described in the scriptures, which should be present in the Acharya, etc., such a true Bhavaacharya - Bhavasadhu, etc., is the best character worthy of worship, - not the Dravyaacharya - Dravyasadhu, etc.; therefore,
"Like the names of the yonis,
The names of the faithful are also dear to Me." - Gita "Tamyat tadau shraddhapradano matim avato vike paramanandaula." Yes. Yes.

The supreme reverence and respect for the Bhavacharyas, etc., has been stated by Shri Haribhadrasuri. Therefore, what kind of extraordinary, detached, and calm state of being should be the self-state and the state of qualities of the Bhagwan Acharyas, etc., who have been given a glorious place in the Panch Parameshthis? A discerning seeker should carefully examine this with wisdom and understanding. He should perform pure service and devotion towards the Bhavacharyas, etc., who are like awakened Jinas, who are the embodiment of Yoga, and in whom the feeling of self-knowledge is manifested. This is the best seed.

"The self-knower is called a Shraman, others are material beings.
The one who illuminates the object in the past, is the treasure of bliss, the companion of the soul." - Shri Anandghanaji.

Constant devotion is also the best seed. Writing, worship, charity, listening, publication, and self-study of the scriptures are the young seeds. The knowers have left behind a priceless legacy of knowledge for us. How much is this world indebted to the person who removes the illusion of the world and enriches it with the wealth of the ultimate goal? How much are we indebted? How can we repay this debt of the ultimate goal? This is a matter of duty. "There is no one who is not a debtor." Similarly, the state of the wealth of the ultimate goal in the form of knowledge is the same. Either it is given away, accumulated, or it is destroyed. Only one who is a student of knowledge can give the gift of knowledge, only then the flow of knowledge continues. It can be achieved by enjoying the spiritual nectar of knowledge with relish and reaping the desired bliss. If that doesn't happen, then only the third state remains. Therefore, we should enjoy the legacy of the knower with utmost respect and honor. As the Vedic religionists say, we can repay the debt towards the living beings and the knowers only through continuous self-study. Therefore, to repay this debt, we should use the wonderful treasure of knowledge of the supremely benevolent knowers for the benefit of the self and the world, and spread the influence of the ultimate scriptures generously. In other words, we should constantly and regularly perform the continuous knowledge-sacrifice through self-study, and instill the essence of the scriptures in the soul. Only those who have such a soul, who are like diamonds, will be able to open the treasure of knowledge with the key of wisdom, and gradually spread it in the world. When the rich and the wise come together in this noble work, when the river of knowledge of the wise merges with the river of wealth of the rich, and creates the confluence of Saraswati, then by immersing oneself in this triveni sangam, the world will become pure. Then, the world will resound with the victory of the words of the knower, and the virtuous souls who have benefited from this seed will also be victorious. - This understanding is revealed here.

Thus, the scripture-makers emphasize devotion above all. Devotion to the Lord, ...

Devotion to the Sadguru (true teacher) and devotion to the Shrutis (sacred scriptures) are the primary means to attain liberation (Moksha). Because the Lord, the ultimate goal, who is the embodiment of perfection, always resides in the heart, constantly reminding the soul of its true nature and its ultimate goal. The Sadguru, the perfect guide, the embodiment of the path to liberation, is a virtuous soul, a true sage, a living embodiment of the awakened state, a living Yogi, who inspires the soul to become its true self. And in the absence of such a Sadguru, or in accordance with their teachings, the scriptures also become the ultimate guide, benefiting the soul that is worthy and capable of receiving their teachings. These two forms of devotion, like a stream of pure, detached consciousness, nourish the soul, leading to its gradual development and ultimately, to the attainment of liberation. 

Just as a branch cannot exist without a root, a tree cannot exist without a trunk, and a building cannot stand without a foundation, similarly, the edifice of liberation cannot be built without the foundation of devotion. This foundation is the "abhaya, advesha, akheda" (fearlessness, non-hatred, non-attachment) which is the first step in the path of liberation. 

If we wish to build this magnificent edifice of liberation, we must lay a strong foundation of universal compassion, and upon this foundation, we must plant the seed of devotion, which will grow into a strong pillar. Only then can the edifice be built, and only then can the higher stages of liberation be attained. Otherwise, it would be like building a house in the sky, without any support or foundation. 

Therefore, O noble souls, O seekers of liberation, first build this foundation of devotion, which will lead to the construction of the magnificent edifice of liberation. Then, you will be able to place the pot of liberation upon it, and achieve the ultimate goal of realizing your true nature. You will then be able to reside permanently in this magnificent abode of liberation. 

Thus, the scriptures, like a wise sage, are urging the seekers to embark on this journey of devotion.

Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion) is the best and the first among all paths to liberation. Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga (the path of action), and Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge) are not truly different or contradictory, but rather three facets of the same path, interconnected and complementary to each other. 

Because, devotion with understanding of the ultimate reality is Bhakti Yoga, action with devotion to the ultimate reality is Karma Yoga, and the practice of self-realization, which is the path to liberation, is Jnana Yoga. 

Jnana Yoga is the practice of knowledge, which is the ultimate realization of the self, achieved through devotion and action. 

Devotion without understanding is like a ritual without meaning.

Just as a form without substance is not fruitful, so too knowledge without devotional action is not fruitful. Thus, these three yagas are in harmony.
3. Knowledge Yoga and Action Yoga
And from this, the great mysterious formula, "Moksha is from knowledge-action, "Jnanashiyamyaam Moksha," is also revealed. That is, knowledge is primarily the knowledge of the pure self, the knowledge of the soul, and action is primarily the action of the soul, the action of the soul's character, the character of the soul, and when these two are in harmony, then moksha is attained. X Knowledge and action are like the two wheels of a chariot; if one of these wheels is missing, the chariot of dharma will not move. Action without knowledge is blind, and knowledge without action is useless. If a fire is burning, a blind person will be destroyed even if he sees it, and a useless person will be destroyed even if he runs. But if the useless person is placed on the shoulders of the blind person, and the blind person walks according to his instructions, both will cooperate and harmonize, and they will be saved. Similarly, in order to escape from the fire of the world, the seeker should harmonize knowledge and action accordingly. Here, knowledge is placed first and action is placed second, which suggests that action should be in accordance with knowledge, with a theoretical understanding, and that is why the practice of action is called "Anushthan." The first is knowledge and then compassion, "Vadamana Nal To Cha'e," the secret of this great formula is also the same.
(
The knowledge of substance and the action of substance also have their rightful place here. Because the knowledge of substance and the action of substance that cause the birth of emotion also become the cause of moksha by tradition, but the knowledge-action that does not cause such emotion is unsuccessful in terms of the fruit of moksha. Shri Haribhadrasuri has shown the meaning of the word "substance" in the Pancha-Sharkshastra, from which this ultimate meaning is revealed: (1) One substance is non-principal, without such emotion. For example, an acharya who is devoid of the qualities prescribed in the scriptures, such as being a good speaker, is called a "dravyacharya," and similarly, in the context of action, the action that is done mechanically, without any use, without any emotion, is also an example of non-principal substance. (2) The second meaning of substance is the ability to generate emotion; the substance that causes emotion, the substance from which emotion manifests, is the other type, which is the principal substance. It is the one that produces emotion. This principal substance is praised and is presented here in moksha. That is why the principal substance is praised -

Sri Haribhadrasuri has clearly stated that only those *mumukṣus* who have attained the special state of *apūnabhandhakādi* (and other such states) are entitled to the authority of *dravya ājñā*. These *mumukṣus* are characterized by qualities like lightness, mild passions, mild objects of attachment, extremely subtle results, deep-seated dispassion, true seekers of the path, intense thirst for the truth. This is because the primary *dravya* action itself is capable of generating the specific emotions. The state of *apūnabhandhakādi* is preceded by the state of *samṛdu-bhandhakādi*, which is a non-primary *dravya* action. This is because it performs the action of following *dravya ājñā* in a sluggish manner, and therefore, they are not even qualified for the path of liberation through *dravya*.

The definition of *dravya* as "non-use" - "being without use" - also confirms all the above. Thus, the scriptures have given a place in the path of liberation only to the primary *dravya* action that generates specific emotions, and not to the non-primary *dravya* action that is sluggish due to non-use. The secret behind considering *dravya* in the path of liberation even in the first four perspectives like *mitrādiṣṭi*, despite the *dravya* being praised, is that it involves the primary *dravya* action capable of generating emotions. Thus, such *dravya* action also has its rightful place here, because the ultimate goal of *dravya* is also emotion, and the support of *dravya* is also to climb onto emotion, and it is inevitable to reach emotion. This emotion is the emotion of the self, the manifestation of knowledge, perception, character, and other virtues in the self, the transformation of the nature of the self. The entire path of Jainism is primarily based on this emotion. Emotion is its life, without it, it remains empty and hollow.

"The pure emotion and the emotionless action are as far apart as the sun and the firefly." - Sri Gadadharasamucchayakara, comparing *dravya* and emotion. "Pure emotion and emotionless action, how vast is the distance between them? The blazing sun and the fireflies, their brilliance is incomparable." - *Daśaśāstra*.

"The *dravya* action awakens the interest, the emotion is devoid of interest; even the teacher is helpless, what can he do to the new soul? - *Chandranan*." - Sri Devchandraji.

"From *apūnabhandhak* to the ultimate virtues, the path is known through the language of emotion, depending on the emotion." - Sri Yashovijayaji.

Just as this is true for *dravya* action, it is also true for *dravyaśruta* knowledge. Because the scriptures are the best means and instruments for attaining knowledge, they are called knowledge by convention. Therefore, dry knowledge like the mere study of *dravyaśruta* knowledge does not lead to any knowledge. But when the soul attains its best means, it transforms itself into knowledge, that is, "These are not the *ahigarin* (those who have not attained liberation), here even the *dravya* is not the same." - *Sri Pañcāśaka*.

If someone claims to be a Keval-Shushkgyani and believes they are practicing the path to liberation, but their actions evoke compassion in others, it indicates a contradiction. They are likely focused on external practices, mistaking the means for the end, and forgetting the true goal. They engage in mechanical external actions without realizing the importance of internal self-transformation, the true essence of spiritual practice. They remain untouched by the experience of non-duality and even discourage the pursuit of knowledge. Such Shushkgyanis engage in dry, superficial discussions about Ad-meksha and other concepts, but remain trapped in their own ego and self-righteousness. They cling to words and reject all practical actions. They haven't attained true knowledge and have abandoned the path of practice. Association with such "name-only spiritual" Shushkgyanis leads to spiritual downfall.

t
Those who haven't attained knowledge and haven't engaged in practice,
Those who associate with them, drown in the ocean of existence.
Hearing the words of liberation, abandoning practice is a mistake;
Keeping liberation in mind, practice diligently. ''—Shri Atmasiddhi

Thus, those who are action-oriented are attached to external practices and lack true liberation. Similarly, Shushkgyanis are attached to knowledge and reject external practices, making them ineligible for liberation. Both action-oriented and Shushkgyanis are driven by the belief "My way is right," but lack the true understanding of "My way is the right way." The true self, however, harmonizes liberation with its means, the right practice. One should not abandon the right practice after hearing the words of liberation, but should constantly keep liberation in mind and engage in the right practice. This way, knowledge and action, both paths, become mutually supportive. The union of pure self-knowledge and action free from attachment and aversion, the pure self-transformation, leads to the attainment of liberation, the true nature of the self. As Shri Yashavijayji said in his teachings, one should practice action-yoga, embrace knowledge-yoga, ascend to meditation-yoga, and finally attain liberation-yoga.

“Those who reject external practices based on words are false, those who embrace external practices along with words are true. Those who reject external practices based on words are like flowers of the world, they may be admired but offer no real benefit.” —Shri Anandghanji.

"By practicing action-yoga, embracing knowledge-yoga, ascending to meditation-yoga, one attains liberation-yoga."
—Shri Adhyatmasar.

47 III The essence is the divine guidance of the right vision. Thus, the true vision of the path of devotion, knowledge, and action, as a proper system, is possible only through the right vision; only through this divine eye can the divine vision of the path of the Jinas be attained. Without this ultimate vision, everything is darkness. "Darkness without eyes, that is the state of affairs here in the path of ultimate truth, it seems quite true. Until blindness is avoided, the vision of the spiritual path of liberation or the original path of the Jinas cannot be attained; for the Jinas to see this spiritually dominant path of ultimate truth, this divine right vision must be opened, and the blindness of the soul must be avoided. The vision of this inner path cannot be attained through the external right vision like the Gadariya stream. Therefore, to remove the worldly right vision of the soul, which is like the Gadariya stream, and to give spiritual vision with the true vision of the divine path of the Jinas, and in the realm of Yoga-bindu, "O, stand firm, O seeker!" - as if to fulfill this fatherly blessing, the sage Maharshi Haribhadracharya has created this "Right Vision Collection" text, it seems. Because in the absence of such vision, even the supernatural spiritual path is seen through the worldly vision of the past, present, and future - through the right vision! Mahatma Anandghanji has said, "The path is like a blind eye, the whole world is lost."
But the Jinas - the liberated ones - have the original path in the form of the three jewels, which is primarily a spiritual path, a path of ultimate truth, an inner path of feeling. Whatever is in harmony with this path of liberation, which leads to the soul, regardless of caste or appearance, attains liberation. That is, knowing the pure soul, having faith, and practicing it, keeping this eternal, certain, attainable goal in mind, constantly fixing one's vision on the "Pure Light of Knowledge," which is the essence of all twelve categories, serving the pure conduct that is the means of its attainment, harmonizing determination and conduct, is the one who attains liberation. Because it is due to the corruption of the form that the soul has been revolving in the world, and the main purpose of all conduct is to bring the soul back to its form and establish it in its "own home." Therefore, conduct is the right vision - conduct in the form of knowledge and conduct - through the progressive purification of the three jewels, this form, which is our own, attains the first stage, the state of our own, the soul becomes the seeker and the practitioner of the path of liberation, which is the three jewels, and progressively touches the higher and higher stages - states - on the path of liberation, moving forward.
*"If one does not desire to abandon the worldly conduct, what is the use of the pilgrimage?" - an ancient saying. "The pure is to be explained to the pure, not to those who are not pure, who are not seekers of the ultimate truth." - Shri Samayasar, verse 12.

It keeps increasing and finally, attaining the ultimate peak of self-purification, that supreme yogi attains the ultimate liberation, the pure self-realization - becomes Siddha. This is what the Samat Yogashastra proves.
"Just as the fuel of pure Nay burns the bondage of ego and attachment, the lamp of pure Nay leads to the path of liberation, pure Nay is the foundation for the sadhu. Pure Nay meditation always leads to that which has pure conduct. Just as saffron is in the midst of dirt, so is the conduct of the mind free from the taint of the world." - Shri Yashovijayji
Thus, the true vision of the path leading to the ultimate goal can only be achieved through this divine Nayana, which is like a magnifying glass. As the supreme soul Anandghanji has said, "The Nayana that sees the path, that Nayana is divine thought." How is this divine Nayana attained? It is attained from one who has attained it. A lamp is lit from another lamp. What is in the well comes out into the air. One who sees shows the way. How can a blind person show the way? A blind person falls into a pit and causes others to fall. Therefore, this divine Nayana is attained only from a true seer, a Bhavagi Sadguru, who has attained this divine eye, which is like a magnifying glass, and not from an Asadguru, who is blind. To expect divine Nayana from a blind guru, who is like a blind man following another blind man, is like expecting flowers from the sky. In the words of Shri Anandghanji, "The blind man runs away from the experience of the guru lineage. Because as long as the Mithyatva is not removed, the vision is not clear, and the Samyagdasti is not opened, until then, blindness from the ultimate goal is appropriate. This Mithyatva-like blindness is worse than birth blindness; a birth-blind person does not see, but a Mithyatva-blind person sees evil! Therefore, such a blind Asadguru, being on the wrong path himself, leads others astray and throws them into the pit, into the abyss of evil; therefore, to go on the right path, one needs the guidance of the Sadguru's Nayana.
Moreover, if the vision is colored by the desire for vision, it is tainted, clouded, or if one wears colored glasses, then the vision is also colored (Coloured vision), it is not real. Similarly, if the vision of the soul is colored by the desire for vision, then its vision is also colored - distorted, it is not Samyag. Many times, people mistakenly believe that the affirmation of the desire for vision is also Samyagdasti, but it is a completely different thing, because the vision that arises from the desire for vision is colored by that desire and is tainted and therefore Asamyag, and the vision that arises from Samyagdasti is free from the desire for desire, pure and clean, and therefore Samyag. For example, the father's family duty...

It is a clear manifestation of *dristirag* (attachment to one's own view) to consider someone a Guru, even if they lack the qualities of self-knowledge, *vitragata* (freedom from attachment), etc., simply because of their adherence to their own sect or out of egoistic attachment to their lineage. Similarly, believing that only a particular individual is true and everything else is false is also a form of *dristirag*. It is very difficult to overcome this *dristirag*. Shri Hemchandracharya Ji has lamented, "Oh Lord! It is easy to give up *sneharag* (attachment to loved ones) and *kamrag* (attachment to desires), but this evil *dristirag* is difficult to overcome, it is very difficult." However, when one has a *sambhyashti* (right perception), there is no attachment, and one sees things as they truly are. One understands the true nature of the universe, the true nature of the *sadguru*, and the true nature of everything. This understanding leads to a true and unwavering belief. In *taap* (delusion) or *dristirag*, there is belief in one's own opinion, while in *samyagdristi* (right perception), there is belief in the truth. The *dristiragi* (one with attachment to their own view) believes that "mine" is true, while the *samyagdristi* believes that "true... is mine." There is a clear difference between the two. Therefore, the wise do not get confused.

"The nature of *dristirag* is like a mirror, it does not know its own nature, it does not know the way of *syadvad* (the doctrine of maybe)." - Shri Devchandraji

Therefore, the *mumukṣu* (seeker of liberation) who desires *samyagdristi* should abandon *dristirag* and *dristiadhapasu* (blind faith), and reject the ignorant and *asadguru* (false guru) who is blind to the truth. They should seek the guidance of a *samyagdristi* (right perception) possessing, knowledgeable, *vitrag* (free from attachment) *sadguru*. Because, what is invisible to the physical eye, "cannot be seen without the divine eye," "cannot be obtained without the divine eye," but "by serving the feet of the *sadguru*, one obtains it directly." - The scriptures also become inaccessible without the guidance of the *guru*. Because the scriptures are the words of the self-realized, knowledgeable person, only the *parmarthic* (spiritual) *sadguru*, who is a self-realized, experienced soul, can understand their meaning, their heart, and their secrets. And only they are capable of revealing them. Therefore, the *sadguru*, holding the *prajnarup* (wisdom) *shalaka* (measuring rod) and the *pravachanarup* (divine) *anjan* (collyrium), applies the "knowledge-collyrium measuring rod" to the soul, only then the *dristirag* of the soul is removed, only then the divine eye opens, only then the divine vision is revealed, and only then the pure soul, the *shushunidhan* (ultimate abode), the *madgadhimavan* (greatly powerful), the *meru* (mountain) like, is realized.

66
"The *sadguru* applies the *pravachan* (discourse) *anjan* (collyrium), and one sees the ultimate abode; the heart's eye beholds the Lord of the universe, whose glory is like Mount Meru." - Shri Anandghanaji

There is a great mystery in the scriptures considering the Gita as the ultimate authority on the *guru*. This confirms the same point. Because the Gita is not just a collection of verses, but it is a song of the ultimate truth, a song of the heart, a song that has been deeply internalized, like music, it is a song that resonates with the soul.

He who has done it, has done self-reflection, has done self-realization, is "Gitarth"; that is, he who has sung, experienced the ultimate decisive ultimate truth of the self, is Gitarth. Such a Gitarth self-realized wise man is eligible to become a Guru. Otherwise, an ignorant Guru without such Gitarth becomes "Guru" (heavy) due to his karma burden.
The ignorant walks according to his own will, wanders without any direction; the ignorant walks on the path he chooses, he is an endless samsari. Jinji! Just as many learned, many people agree, many disciples are nurtured; just as they follow the Jin Shaasan, they are those who are not firm in their resolve. Jinji! The Gitarth who speaks the truth, who finds it in the Agam, the wise man who is well-equipped with the meaning of the self, how can he remain silent without saying it? - Shri Yashovijayji.
Thus, the true Gitarth, the wise, the self-realized Sadguru, is the only one from whom the ultimate devotional Guru-grace is obtained. In this regard, there is a beautiful saying: There is a well of nectar in the middle of the sky-dome-consciousness, that is, the peaceful, virtuous, timeless soul resides there. He who has found the Sadguru, he alone drinks from that well of nectar, fills himself with peace and virtue, his thirst is quenched, that is, his worldly thirst is quenched, and by drinking that nectar, he attains that nectar-like state. Otherwise, he who has not found the Sadguru, he is deprived of the benefit of drinking nectar, he walks thirsty, that is, his worldly thirst is not quenched and he attains only death, that is, he continues to go through the cycle of birth and death, his birth and death do not end.
"There is a well in the middle of the sky-dome, there resides the nectar; he who has a Guru drinks it in abundance, he who does not have a Guru goes thirsty...
O Avadhu! Those hundred yogis are my Guru, I offer my salutations to their feet." - Shri Anandghanji. "He who shows the truth nectar, the four-armed one meets him, he drinks the nectar of the Nirjan, he lives for ages and ages." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
When Lord Mahavira gave Shri Gautam Swami the right vision, the meaning of the Vedas was also understood correctly. If the vision is right, even the wrong scriptures are interpreted correctly, and if the vision is wrong, even the right scriptures are interpreted wrongly. The secret of seeing is also understood if the vision is right. Therefore, the vision should be right. And its attainment is, as mentioned above, dependent on Shri Sadguru. Such a visionary man is able to show the true form of things by giving divine vision. But such people who speak the truth about things, who are knowledgeable by personal experience, are rare, they are like a famine in the world. Anandghanji has... 

Page #52:
---------------------------
As it has been said, "Rare are those who speak of things as they are, in accordance with their true nature." The rest, without any true, experiential knowledge of the object, merely speak of it in a hypothetical way. They are all dry and empty.

It is sad that in this country, in this community, where spirituality has been reduced to a mere material concept, without any real understanding of its true nature, there is a great deal of confusion. People are merely following their emotions and sentiments, without any real understanding of the true nature of spirituality. They are merely grasping at the tail of spirituality, without knowing its true essence. They are not seeking to know the soul, but are merely pursuing their own selfish interests. As a result, they will only harm the country and their own families. - Shri Mansukh Bhai Kirtuchanda Mehta.

Because the divine eye has been deprived of the ability to contemplate the true nature of things, "The divine eye has been deprived of the contemplation of things, and is left in a state of uncertainty." Therefore, there is no true contemplation of the true nature of things. Just as without right vision (eyesight), one cannot see external objects in their true form, so too, without right vision, one cannot see the true form of the soul and other subtle objects. Without this divine eye, no matter how many hypothetical and abstract thoughts one may have about the entire universe, they are all ultimately empty and meaningless. Because, who am I? What is my true nature? This fundamental and central question is rarely contemplated with peace and discernment. Therefore, one tries to know the entire lake, but does not even try to know the nature of the soul-god residing in the body-temple! This right vision of the contemplation of the true nature of the soul, which is the primary objective, is primarily dependent on the guidance of a true, knowledgeable, and virtuous guru. And it is through this spiritual yogic vision that one sees the divine path of yoga.

Therefore, as the saying goes, "As the vision is, so is the creation," and "As the vision is, so is the creation," the yogi, who has this vision, desires to walk the divine path of yoga (Ichcha Yoga). Therefore, according to the principle of "Chattaram Puran Darshan," the "Drista" man, with his unwavering determination, indomitable enthusiasm, and single-minded devotion, walks the path of righteousness (Pravritti). He faces the obstacles that come his way with extraordinary courage and continues to walk the path with peace and stability (Sthira Yoga). And finally, having reached his desired destination, he completes his journey on the path of yoga and achieves unparalleled success (Siddhi Yoga).

The meaning is that the "Jogi Jan," who walks the path of yoga, constantly remains vigilant and alert to prevent the distortion of the true nature of the soul by external influences. He observes the five restraints of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possessiveness, both in thought and deed. He also observes the five observances of purity, 

Page #53:

## English Translation:

**52**

He practices the five vows of non-violence, austerity, self-study, and devotion to God; abandoning the body-consciousness, which is the seat of the external, he establishes himself in the consciousness of the Self; he purges the external emotions and practices the breath-control of the inner consciousness, which is like the filling and emptying of a vessel; he withdraws the senses from the objects of sense and draws the soul back from the external, which is called *pratyahara*; he holds the soul in its own nature, which is called *dharana*; he becomes steady in mind and steady in wisdom, and meditates on the soul with one-pointed concentration, and experiences the supreme absorption in the pure Self, which is called *samadhi*. And thus, those who desire the infinite abode of bliss, the *susanta-gindras*, remain in its contemplation day and night, and they attain that supreme, pure, and blissful abode, where infinite peace flows, which is like the nectar of immortality. “The abode of bliss is infinite, the *susanta* desires it, he remains in its contemplation day and night; that supreme, infinite, blissful peace, I bow to that abode, I praise it, I celebrate it.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji.

**(2)** The author of this scripture, the great sage Haribhadracharya, has shown us the true nature of the path of yoga, which is full of ultimate purpose, with his divine yogic vision. Let us conclude with a few words about the holy character of this scripture writer: In this land of India, there have been a few true saints who have been above the insistence of different philosophies, and among them, Shri Haribhadracharya was a unique saint and a true knower of the truth, who shone with a different light; he was a great influencer, a sage with a vision, who truly embraced the all-embracing, impartial, and multi-faceted vision of *anekanta*, which harmonized all philosophies. This *yakini* (certain) great man, who lived in the 8th and 9th centuries, is well-known. According to the information available to us from the *Prabhavacharita* and other sources, he was a resident of Chitrakoot (Chittorgarh), a great scholar of all scriptures, and a learned Brahmin; he was also the honored priest of the king Jitarina. He had excelled in all fourteen types of knowledge, but he had become proud of his knowledge. This arrogant man, who did not respect his father, made a foolish vow, saying, “I will become a disciple of anyone whose words I cannot understand.” Thus, Haribhadra, the best of the twice-born, was proud but also a symbol of simplicity and a seeker of truth. One day, he was passing by the *upaashraya* (Jain temple) when he heard an old *sadhviji* (Jain nun) named *yakini* Mahottara reciting the following verse in a sweet voice:

"चक्की दुगं हरिपणगं पणगं चक्कोण केसवा चक्क । केसव चक्की केसव दुचक्की केसी य चक्की य ।।" 

Page #54:
---------------------------
53
Haribhadra tried hard to find the meaning of this verse, but he couldn't figure it out. So he went to the old woman and mockingly asked, "Hey, old lady! What are you doing, chirping like that?" The old woman replied, "Son, the newly learned chirp like this. 'Navahita viviayate.' (Meaning, you are also a new student in the field, a novice, so all this might seem like chirping to you, but it's not.)" With this poignant reply, Haribhadra's mockery was turned back on him, and he was left speechless. 

Seeing this miracle, the truthful and steadfast Sarlaazma Haribhadra became humble and respectfully asked, "Oh, mother! Please explain the meaning of this lesson you gave. I don't understand it. I am your disciple." The holy nun said, "Oh, Bhadra! We don't have the custom of taking a man as a disciple, but since you are curious, go to our Dharma Acharya." So Haribhadra went to the priest Jinbhaṭṭācārya, told him everything, and became his disciple. Then, upon touching the touchstone of Jinadana, the truth-testing Haribhadra's soul was dyed with its color. Thus, the yogini 'Yakini' who was the reason for his life's transformation and the ultimate benefactor who granted him the attainment of the ultimate goal, was considered by Haribhadra as his Dharma mother, the one who gave him the Dharma birth, the true 'Dwij' who made him a true seeker. He started identifying himself as 'Yakini Mahattasu' and even in his immortal works, he preserved this memory of her, which is still visible today. 

The sharp-witted Swami Haribhadra became proficient in all the Jina scriptures in a short time, and his Guru, recognizing his brilliance, established him in his own position. 

His nephew, Hansa and Paramhansa, took initiation from him. These two great intellectuals, proficient in logic, went to a Buddhist city in disguise to study Buddhist logic, even though their Guru had not permitted them to do so. Later, when their presence was discovered, the Buddhists killed Hansa, but Paramhansa barely escaped and reached his Guru. When he revealed the truth, he too died of grief. 

Thus, Haribhadra Suri, who was immersed in sorrow due to the loss of such excellent disciples, was overcome by a momentary fit of anger. But the three verses, 'Zulsail Shilamma', etc., which his Guru had taught him, immediately calmed him down. He deeply regretted his momentary outburst and sought atonement. 

Then, the great seeker, who was deeply affected by the loss of his disciples and who was seeking liberation from this sorrowful cycle of existence with intense detachment, was motivated by the unparalleled and astonishing efforts of the scholar 'Shastrasati' Sri Haribhadracharya. The three verses that his Guru had given him... 

Page #55:
---------------------------
Haribhadrasuri, known for his 54 melis, composed the extensive "Sangarangatarangini Sami Samraishchakaha" (Samradditya Katha).  Furthermore, this supremely fearful, liberated soul, seeking liberation, created a unique 1400-chapter text, solely for the purpose of mental or physical atonement.  The loss of his father, who was a scholar, and the longing for his father's presence in the next life, are immortalized in his father's lineage of scholarly descendants, "Virad," as a testament to his father's legacy.  For example, in the same text, "Bharavihelo," he restored the completely dilapidated Maha Nishita Shastra. (So far, only about 75 of his texts are available.)

Such a saintly character, with his virtuous conduct, has become immortal in his written form, his "Akshara Atma" (soul of letters) truly immortal.  The saying of Sri Bhatruhari, "Those poets who are not afraid of the fear of decay, are victorious," is literally true in the context of this saintly poet's immortal words.  Haribhadrasuri, the creator of 1400 great texts, like Hemachandracharya, the creator of 350 million verses of literature, the omniscient of the Kali Yuga, became an extraordinary literary giant, a colossal poet-Brahma, a seer, a great sage.  His immortal works, each more beautiful than the last, resonate with a divine sound, filled with such nectarous sweetness that one never tires of reading them.  Haribhadrasuri, the tranquil, virtuous, ocean of knowledge, is a treasure trove of inexhaustible, divine sound and nectar.  This divine sound is the inner voice of this seer, and the unwavering devotion that flows through each verse is a reflection of his supremely devoted heart.  Each text, woven together in a beautiful word-picture, with a refined, elegant, and perfect style, demonstrates the extraordinary skill of this great sage in composing texts.

Furthermore, his intention is so profound that it is impossible to measure or fathom, like the ocean.  Because behind each of his words lies an immense knowledge of scriptures, unique philosophical thought, and the strong support of supreme spiritual experience.  Therefore, to truly understand the intention of the work of such a great soul, who has attained such a high state of yoga, is the task of a great soul like him, who has attained a similar state.  Only they can do justice to it, only they can truly evaluate it, just as only a skilled gem expert can test a true gem.  Because Sri Haribhadracharya, a master of the unique art of weaving texts with concise, sutra-like, profound intentions, has condensed an ocean of discourse into a single point, with his extraordinary power of synthesis.

“From a single drop of water, the Shruta Sagar expands;
Blessed are the Jinas, who, like the ocean, are vast, yet contained in a single drop”—Shri Chidanandji.

Therefore, it is the task of insightful critics, who are bold in their thinking, to delve into the depths of such profound discourses.  “Is this the essence of the three-fold heroism?”  Such critics, with their insightful minds, have, to the best of their ability, attempted to dive into this collection of Yaga-Dristi, the jewel of literature, and to understand the essence of “Sumananand’s” critique.  May this effort bring joy to the minds of the noble!
Virtues, whatever they may be, are the essence of the holy, and faults, whatever they may be, are mine, a mere mortal.
May the swan of good sense, with its pure vision, discard the faults and embrace the virtues!  With this humble request, I, Bhagwandas, offer my heartfelt gratitude.

##  Translation:

**Commencement of the Commentary on the Collection of Gadaṣṭi Sūtras**

It is a customary practice to mention auspiciousness, purpose, subject, and relationship at the beginning of a commentary. Following this tradition, these learned Ācāryas have presented this first sūtra.  

This sūtra has the following objectives:

1. To uphold the tradition of the learned community.
2. To pacify obstacles.
3. To encourage the activity of the discerning.
4. To reveal the three aspects of purpose, subject, and relationship.

(See the commentary below)

In this sūtra, the learned Ācārya, with a desire to honor the victorious ones who are worthy of being known and who have attained liberation, has offered a salutation to the supreme deity (auspiciousness).  And then, by considering the different perspectives of the Gadaṣṭi, the Ācārya has briefly mentioned the three aspects of purpose, subject, and relationship. This is the overall meaning of this collection of sūtras. 

Here is the specific meaning:

**Translation of the Commentary by Śrīharibhadra Ācārya:**

The objectives of this collection of sūtras are as follows:

1. **To uphold the tradition of the learned community:** The learned community always engages in auspicious activities and reverently salutes the supreme deity. This Ācārya is also a learned person, and therefore, this sūtra is presented to uphold the tradition of the learned community.  It is said, "Learned people always engage in auspicious activities and reverently salute the supreme deity."

2. **To pacify obstacles:**  Auspicious actions are often fraught with obstacles. It is said, "Even great people face many obstacles in auspicious actions, while those engaged in inauspicious actions may find their obstacles easily overcome." This chapter is intended to guide towards right knowledge and is therefore auspicious and beneficial.  Therefore, this sūtra is presented to pacify obstacles.

3. **To encourage the activity of the discerning:** This sūtra is intended to encourage the activity of those who are discerning and who contemplate and act accordingly.

4. **To reveal the three aspects of purpose, subject, and relationship:**  It is said, "How can one understand any scripture or any action without knowing its purpose?"  It is impossible to state the purpose of something that does not exist, and it is impossible to state the purpose of something that has no subject.

Here, as soon as we say "Nami" (bowing), all the souls (atma-pradesh) are completely bowed down (parinamana), all the souls are completely bowed down in devotion, and the mind, speech, and body become the same, that is true "naman" (bowing). If even one such true namaskar (salutation) happens, then there is liberation (kalyana). Regarding this, it is said: *"Ikkovi namukkaroo jinavaravasahass vadhmaanass. Sansanasagaroo taroo na va naari va"* - Shri Pratikramana Sutra *Ekkovi namokaro sammakato sammbhavato cheva / Tare vadhostam nimel EUR yudishriharibhadrasurrikrutshri dharmasangrahni ga, 888* One time bowing to the Lord, according to the Agam, happens; because the truth is the work, the achievement is realized. By knowing the Lord, the pure qualities are realized; with the vision of the goal, the means are also realized, the blessed person is praised... Shri Sambhava. - Shri Devchandraji and the scholars have also bowed down with the same supreme feeling here. - This "ichcha" (desire) means - Jinavarvrushabha = Vardhamana (Mahavira) even one namaskar (salutation) saves a man or woman from the ocean of samsara (worldly existence). It means that even one namaskar (salutation) done with samyaktva (right faith, right knowledge, right conduct) is enough to save you from the cycle of birth and death (apaadha-pul-paravarta), then what to say about praise? (This is the extraordinary greatness of devotion to the Lord). Regarding this, the inquisitive should read the "Lalit Vistara Granth" by Shri Haribhadracharya, who, with extraordinary devotion, sings the divine song of the extraordinary greatness of the Lord and devotion to the Lord. - This writer-critic has been fortunate to offer a small offering of devotion in the form of a critical commentary on this entire book, "Chihemvidhi ni tika". - He sings the immortal glory of Shri Haribhadracharya, "Lalitvistara" is a unique book of devotion. How can it be called an attempt? Because, like the examination of a crow's teeth, its experiment cannot be achieved, it is impossible. [This is called "Kakadanta Pariksha Nyaya". Where anything is impossible, improbable, pointless, this applies. From the word "Adi", "Poora naati to Rana" etc.]. This is called the "fal" (result) relationship. And in that statement, the subject of the statement is implied, it is contained; therefore, no one says that relationship, etc." In it, "Navechhalatodo chonchi vinottammam viran - A yogi, gigamy, jinettmam such a hero, bowing down with desire, - above that, the praise of the desired deity is said.

---------------------------
The word "**Icchayog**" has been used. The inner desire, the true, innocent devotion, the supreme love that is primarily needed in bowing down to the Lord, is definitely present in us, our conscience bears witness to it, therefore the word "**Icchayog**" has been boldly used. Because, being captivated by the supreme wonderful qualities of the Lord, and having supreme love for him, a natural desire to bow down to the beloved Lord arose in them. "**Hasa bha Jineshwar Pritam Maro Re, Aer Na Chahun Re Kant; Rizayo Sahib Sang Na Parihare Re, Bhage Saadi Anant.**" Shri Anandghanji has used the word "**Icchayog**" here intentionally. Therefore, the **Shastrayog** and **Samarthayog** have been excluded. This author, being a great soul, a great scholar, a great **Samarthayog** man, the word "**Icchayog**" that is used for the father, reveals his supreme humility along with his supreme, serious, generous intention. Because, he says that such **Shastrayog** and **Samarthayog** are not entitled to it, therefore, specifically, "**Icchayog**" is used, and in brief, I will say it according to the vision - above that, three things have been said - purpose, etc. Thus, the meaning of the **Glak Sutra** is collective, and the meaning of the parts (the meaning of each word separately) is as follows: **Naty** - bowing down, **Pranami** - bowing down, **Vi** - the hero, **Pranami** - bowing down. In what way is he bowing down? It is said - **Icchayog** - with **Icchayog**, that is, as if there is **Icchayog**. This adjective is for the exclusion of **Shastrayog** and **Samarthayog**, and it is desirable to exclude them because of their lack of entitlement. At the beginning of the chapter, by abandoning falsehood, this exclusion has been said by demonstrating the activity of universal propriety (appropriate-suitable) at the beginning. And the form of these three (**Icchayog**, **Shastrayog**, and **Samarthayog**) will be said immediately after this. To whom is he bowing down, what kind of hero? For that, it is said - **Vinottam Jinottam** - this is an adjective for a specific thing. Here, all those who are victorious over **Ragadi** (victorious) are called **Jin** like **Ritajin**, **Avadhijin**, **Man:paryayajnana Jin**, and **Kevali Jin**. Among them, that hero is superior because of his **Kevalipana** and **Tirthankarpana**. This adjective "**Jinottam**" refers to the **Karmakaya** state, which is the result of the **Tirthankar** name-karma, which is the result of the **Bhagavant**'s actions, and which is the ultimate purpose. The **TathaBhavya** attracted **Var Badhilaabh** is within him, and the **Tirthankar** name-karma is the result of the **Anuttar Punya** form earned from the **Ahndavastha**. This is given the adjective - **Ayog** - such a hero. **Shavvaaman Jarm Cho:** The karma of mind, speech, and body is **Yog**. He who does not have **Yog** is **Ag** - such a hero. And from this, the **Bhagavant**'s **Shaileshi** state, which is to be in the future, the removal of all karma, the **TathaBhavya**'s **Parikshay** from which the supreme knowledge-bliss arises, and the **Kritakritayata** from which the **Nishkitarth** form arises, is the ultimate fruit-like **Tavakaya** state. Therefore, it is said -

---------------------------
I would not deviate from the word "Mangalacharan" or speak in a way that would make it seem like I am defeated, for that would be false speech, and that is not right to do, it should be avoided. Otherwise, how could the great "Munimunu" remain if even one false word is uttered without thinking? Therefore, this word usage is appropriate, it is the right thing to do. And this is said to show an example of how a seeker should act appropriately with their soul in all places. Wherever, whatever, however it may be, if it is appropriate, then understand and act accordingly, that is called "aucitya" or appropriateness. What a wonderful creation! What a depth of meaning! What sincerity! "Wherever, whatever is appropriate, understand it there, act accordingly there, with your soul, oh people." Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi. Thus, by using a single word, the author, the great sage, has skillfully and subtly indicated many purposes. (1) He has shown supreme love and devotion with a desire-driven approach. (2) He has indicated the father's knowledge of the scriptures, including right understanding, according to the characteristics of the desire-body. (3) He has asserted his own authority to weave the science of Yoga-understanding from above. (4) He has frankly stated his own lack of authority in the scriptures and the strength of the scriptures, introducing the father's supreme humility, effortless simplicity, and the truthfulness of the ultimate goal. (5) He has set an example of acting appropriately everywhere, encouraging others to do the same. "Sonche - Chogigamyune. It is understandable to those who are yogis, to those who are virtuous. Yogis here have accepted the principles of righteousness, etc. From above, again, the false-sighted ones have been told about the understanding of the Lord (negation). Because their curiosity also lies in the final realization of their own nature, therefore, their absence is there (it does not diminish). And - "Veeran" - the virtuous, this is a proper name (a name according to the exact meaning of the word). The one who is valiant, who is powerful through his great strength, who has conquered his enemies like passions, etc., through penance and the destruction of karma, and who has attained the supreme state of enlightenment, that is the virtuous one. Thus, from above, the description of these qualities, which are extraordinary to others, is the form of the true feeling - the praise of the beloved deity. And the belovedness is due to the excellence of the Lord's qualities (his extraordinary nature), and the divinity is due to the attainment of the supreme state. In between, the same four, the same: - I will briefly explain it according to their different perspectives - from above, three things have been said. How? It is said: "V" - I will say, "Cho" - the yoga with the characteristics of friendship, etc.

Here, with salutations, we inquire about the true nature of the revered Lord Vira. The three epithets applied to this Vira Bhagavan are (1) Jinottma, (2) Ag, (3) Gigamya. Their true meaning is as follows: Jinottma - the most excellent among Jinas. The one who has conquered the internal enemies like raga, dvesha, maha, etc. is called a Jin (Arihant-Vitrag). There are different stages of Jinas based on the progressive manifestation of their inner qualities: Kritajin, Avadhijin, Man:paryaya-jnana Jin, and Kevali Jin. And among them, Vira Bhagavan is the most excellent, the most sublime, the most supreme, because he is a Kevali, and also a Tirthankara. The process of attaining the Tirthankara state is as follows: Attracted by the inherent potential (Tathabhavya) of the being, the excellent Badhi-bija was obtained by him in a previous birth. At that time, he served the excellent Sthanakas with devotion, preaching, affection, etc., and performed excellent worship. He thought with the feeling of a Bodhisattva: "I will deliver these unfortunate beings who are suffering in this deep, dark world of Samsara, by the light of this Dharma, and I will make all beings enjoy the taste of the righteous Dharma." Then, with the qualities of Karuna, etc., in a concise and detailed manner, it has been described by the previous teachers in Uttaraadhyaayan-Yoganirnay, etc. You too, through the different perspectives of Yoga. Here, the immediate purpose of the Yoga discourse is to explain the Yoga, while the ultimate purpose is Nirvana. Because, with pure intention, this is a type of activity for the benefit of beings, and this activity is the seed of Nirvana, which is unhindered and certain. The subject of Abhidheya is the same, it is the relationship with the characteristics of Sadhu-Sadhana. This path is clear, well-cultivated, and well-known. And the immediate purpose of the listeners is to understand the meaning of the discourse; the ultimate purpose is also Nirvana, because due to the understanding of the meaning of the discourse, there is appropriate activity here, and this activity is also the unhindered and certain seed of Nirvana. 

"मोहान्धकारगहने संसारे दुःखिता बत  /  सत्त्वाः परिभ्रमन्त्युच्चैः सत्यस्मिन्धर्मतेजसि  //  अहमेतानतः कृच्छ्राद्यथायोगं कथंचन  /  अनेनोत्तारयामीति वरबोधिसमन्वितः  /  /  करुणादिगुणोपेतः परार्थव्यसनी सदा  /  तथैव चेष्टते धीमान्वर्धमानमहोदयः  /  /  तत्तत्कल्याणयोगेन कुर्वन्सत्त्वार्थमेव सः। तीर्थकृत्वमवाप्नोति परं सत्वार्थसाधनम्  // "

"Mangalacharan" endowed, that Supreme Merciful, Great Soul, always bound by selfless service and benevolence, acts in such a way. And by doing so, his great compassion and supreme store of merit and virtues increase. Thus, by performing benevolence towards all beings, he attains the state of a Tirthankara, which is the ultimate means of conquering life. The great devotees have sung: "In the third existence, he performed austerities, and attained the name of Jin; O future beings! He attained the Siddhachakra-pad." - Shri Yashvijayji (Shri Shri Palras) "In the third existence, he played with virtues, with Jin-bhakti as the chief virtue; abandoning the desires for sensual pleasures, he served the Staanaka for twenty years. With great passion, he was attracted to the feelings of the mind; I will rule over all beings, such feelings arose in his mind." - Shri Devchandraji's Snana Puja. This "Jinettma" epithet is used to describe the state of karma-kaya, that is, the state of the embodied form born of karma, where the Tirthankara-nama-karma arises. And despite this embodied state, the state of supreme knowledge, which is the inherent nature of the Lord, is so extraordinary that it is as if he is beyond the body! "Even with a body, his state is beyond the body; to the feet of that Knower, countless salutations." - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi. The karma of mind, speech, and body is yoga, which is not yoga is ayoga. This epithet is used to describe the state of Siddha, that is, the state where the pure self is the only body. This state of pure self, which arises immediately after the shedding of the physical body, is free from all karma, and the supreme bliss of knowledge is experienced beyond the cycle of births and deaths. Having performed all actions, there is a feeling of fulfillment, and by attaining the supreme fruit, it is a state of complete fulfillment and Siddha. This state of karma-free, formless, and pure self is described by the epithet "Ag" to praise the Lord's state of Siddha. "He who is truly self-reliant, becomes Ag." - Shri Anandghanji.

The **Gadashisuchya** is comprehensible only to those who have **Samyagjnana** (right knowledge) - those who have attained **Samyam** (self-control) and **Jnana** (knowledge) like **Shramana** (ascetic) and **Jina** (conqueror). It is not comprehensible to those who have not yet attained **Samyam** and are still in **Mithyadristi** (false perception). This is because the desire to know and inquire arises only in the final stage of **Yathapravrittakaran** (right conduct) and not at any other time. Therefore, the question of understanding the nature of **Jineshwara** (the Jina) is far away. Thus, it is comprehensible only to those who have **Samyagjnana**, hence the epithet **Gigamya**.

Such **Bhagwan** (Lord) are **Veer** (heroic). This is an **Anvartha** (secondary meaning) name, meaning that the word **Veer** is derived from its meaning and is truly applicable. They are truly **Veer** because they are **Bhagwan** (Lord) who are **Parmatmaveer** (supremely heroic). They have **Veer** (heroically) overcome **Karma** (action) through **Tap** (austerity), conquered **Kashaya** (passions) and other internal enemies, and **Kevallakshmi** (supreme fortune) has chosen them, the **Purushottama** (supreme man), because of their **Uttama Guna** (excellent qualities). Thus, because they possess all the qualities of **Vikramvant** (brave) and **Atmaparakramvant** (heroic), the name **Veer** is truly fitting for **Bhagwan**.

Because **Veerapan** (heroism) is **Atma Thane** (within oneself), **Janyun Tumchi Vane Re** (known through your own wisdom). **Kam Veeraya Vashye Jim Bhogi, Tim Thaye Atma Bhogi Re** (Just as one enjoys through the power of heroism, so one becomes a true enjoyer). **Veerji Ne Charane Lagun, Veerapan Te Magun Re** (I seek refuge at the feet of the heroic, I seek heroism). **Mithya Moh Timir Bhay Bhagun, Jit Nagaroo Vanun Re** (I overcome the darkness of false attachment and fear, I proclaim the victory of the Jina). - **Shri Anandghanaji**

**Shuddhata Ekata Tinata Bhavthi, Moh Ripu Jiti Jay Padha Vayo** (With purity, unity, and intensity, the enemy of attachment is conquered, and victory is proclaimed). - **Shri Devchandraji**

**Namo Durvara Ragadaivairivaranivarine / Gate Yoninath Mahaviraaya Ta** (Salutations to the one who overcomes the enemies of attachment and other passions, the Lord of all beings, the great Mahavir). - **Shri Hemchandracharya**'s **Shri Yogashastra**

This style of narration, where each word is explained in detail and its relationship to the whole is shown, is worth contemplating. It is very useful for the student of knowledge. **Shri Haribhadrasuriji** has written this text with great care, weighing each word and syllable, and with deep philosophical contemplation. Even the meter is purposeful. Therefore, keeping this style of narration in mind, one should read and contemplate this **Satashastra** (true scripture) patiently and calmly, and one will experience greater joy. This intention of the text is also mentioned at the beginning of each chapter, usually in the first paragraph, and then elaborated upon in the subsequent commentary.

**Mangalacharan**

Salutation to the **Ishtadeva** (beloved deity).  Here, at the beginning of the scripture, we offer a devotional salutation to the **Ishtadeva**, because it is considered appropriate to sing the praises of the extraordinary and unique qualities of the **Vira** (hero), who is not ordinary. Here, too, the **Ishtadeva** is being praised with the epithet **Ishtadeva** **stava** (hymn), which signifies the qualities of the **Ishtadeva**. The **Ishtadeva** is considered **Ishta** (beloved) due to the supreme qualities of the **Parmatma** (Supreme Soul), and **deva** (deity) due to the attainment of the supreme divine state of **moksha** (liberation). Thus, the **Vira** is truly the **Ishtadeva**.

Furthermore, this **Vira** **Prabhu** (Lord) has taught the **yoga** **dristi** (yogic perspective), which is the cause of **moksha** **sukha** (liberation bliss). In remembrance of this favor, we offer salutations to the **Vira** **Prabhu**.

“**Shiva** **sukha** **karan** **upadishi**, **gat** **ad** **diththi** **re**; **te** **gun** **thani** **jin** **viran**, **karashu** **dharma** **ni** **puththi** **re........vira** **jinesar** **desh** **na**.” – **Shri** **Yashovijayaji** **krit** **yoga** **dristi** **szaya** -11 **prajna** **adi**

Thus, after offering the **mangalacharan**, we have mentioned the three aspects: **prajna** (knowledge), **vishaya** (subject), and **sambandha** (relationship). Here, the subject of discussion is **yoga**. The relationship is that of **sadhya** (goal) and **sadhana** (means). The immediate objective of the author is to briefly describe **yoga**, and the ultimate objective is **moksha**. This is because the author engages in this altruistic activity of **sattva** **hita** (welfare of beings) with pure intention, devoid of any desire for honor, worship, fame, etc. Such pure activity, performed with a pure heart, is the seed of **moksha**, which is inevitable and certain. Just as a seed, when planted, grows into a tree over time, similarly, the seed of this altruistic activity, in the form of this scripture, will inevitably lead to the fruit of **nirvana** (liberation) – **moksha**. This is the ultimate objective of the author.

The immediate objective of the listeners is to understand the meaning of this chapter on **yoga**. Their ultimate objective is also **moksha**. This is because, as the knowledge of the meaning of the chapter increases, so does the appropriate activity in **yoga**. This activity is also the seed of **moksha**, which is inevitable and certain. From this seed, the fruit of **moksha** will inevitably be obtained over time.

“**Eh** **nu** **phal** **dey** **bhed** **sunije**, **anantar** **ne** **parampra** **re**; **anapalana** **chitt** **prasanni**, **mugati** **gati** **suramndir** **re......suvidhi** **jinesar**” – **Shri** **Anandghanaji**

(10) The collection of Gadasthi thus praises the Ishta Devata, and explains the Prajan etc., and in the chapter, it tells a relevant story that is beneficial - इहैवेच्छादियोगानां, स्वरूपमभिधीयते  /  योगिनामुपकाराय, व्यक्तं योगप्रसङ्गतः  // 2 //  The nature of the Yoga of Iccha etc. is described here; for the benefit of the Yogis, it is clearly stated in the context of Yoga. 2, Meaning - Here, the nature of the Yoga of Iccha etc. is clearly stated for the benefit of the Yogis, in the context of Yoga. The discussion now focuses on the nature of Iccha, Shastra, and Samvega, which are the heart of the Yoga, and are beneficial to the current topic. Mitra etc. Gadasthis have a close relationship with it, they are included in it, therefore, it is necessary to mention it in this context. Therefore, it has been said for the benefit of the two types of Yogis, Kulagi and Pravrittachakra, and that too clearly, explicitly, openly, and openly. But the accomplished Siddha Yogis may not benefit from this. The nature that has been described is for the benefit of the Yogis, so that they may know the secret-mystery of Yoga, which is the essence of all Yoga, etc. Here, Yogis are to be understood as the two types of Yogis, Kulagi and Pravrittachakra, not the accomplished Siddhas; because their work is already complete, they have attained the heart of Yoga, and their nature is here, in the process, in the current topic. What? That is - the nature of the Yoga of Iccha etc., Shastra, and Samarthya. What is the reason for this? That is - it is described for the benefit of the Yogis. The Yogis here are Kulagis and Pravrittachakra Yogis (whose nature will be described), not the accomplished Siddhas (whose nature will also be described). Because they do not benefit from this, therefore, it is for the benefit of other Kulagi and Pravrittachakra Yogis. And the benefit from this is to understand the heart of Yoga (its secret-mystery). How is it described? That is - clearly, explicitly (openly), and it is not irrelevant (out of place), therefore, it is said - in the context of Mitra etc. Yoga. It means that it has been attracted and drawn in by the Tantra technique called "Prasanga". The diseases, the Iccha

The 11 *Irchayaagadi* (liberated souls) have already become *Siddhahasta Yogis* (perfect yogis) and have mounted their *Garuda* (mythical bird) on *Jag-Girig* (the mountain of the world). Therefore, such great souls do not need any benefit from this. What is the use of attaining something for someone who has already attained it? What is the use of climbing for someone who has already climbed? Only those who are capable of benefiting from this are the *Kulgi* (born yogis) and the *Pravrittachakra Yogis* (active yogis). "The *Kulgi* and the *Pravrittachakra* are the ones who benefit from this." This is what the *Gadasti* text says. "Those who have climbed the mountain, their path is different." - Shri K.D. Saksay. The author, the great sage, will explain the nature of these three types of *GIs* in detail later. But in brief, "A *Kulgi* is one who is born into the lineage of *Yogis*, that is, one who has attained the *Yogi* dharma from birth, one who is a *GI* from birth (Born Yogis), and others who are naturally inclined to the *GI* dharma, who follow it, are also *Kulgi*, but no one else. Those who perform *havan* (fire sacrifice) in the fire of knowledge, who are experts in spiritual scriptures, and who are residents of the village of the Supreme Brahman, who are constantly immersed in the principle of "Ekamevadvitiyam" (one without a second) and rule the three worlds, and who make sweet sounds like cuckoos in the forest of contentment, and who sit at the root of the tree of thought and constantly eat the fruit of Brahman, such *GIs* are born into the lineage of *GIs*." - *Jnanaeshwari Gita* by Saint Jnanaeshwar Maharaj. "Those who go to the *GI* school, those who follow the dharma, are *Kulgi*; such *Gurus*, *Devas*, and *Dvijas* are beloved, compassionate, and helpful." - Shri K.D. Saksay. *"Or, the mother who gives birth to a son is also considered to be a *GI*. This birth is very rare in the world. If one is fortunate enough to be born in such a lineage, then one gets the association of wisdom from the previous life." - *Gita* Chapter 6.

The introduction states the form of *Iccha Yoga*, *Shastra Yoga* and *Samarthy Yoga* - "The one who desires to perform the Dharma, and who has heard the meaning of the scriptures, even the knowledgeable one, due to negligence, the incomplete Dharma Yoga is called *Iccha Yoga*." 3.

##  Icchayog (13)

The predominance of desire is called "Icchayog". A man with Icchayog is a scholar and a Samyagjnani, but despite that, due to Vikatha (delusion) and other distractions, his Dharmavyapar (religious practice) is incomplete and flawed. 

Here are the main characteristics of a man with Icchayog:

1. **Desire to practice Dharma:** Firstly, he must have a true, genuine, selfless, innocent, and disinterested desire to practice Dharma. Just as in worldly affairs, any action begins with a desire, similarly, in the pursuit of liberation, the first step is to cultivate a true desire to practice Dharma. This deep desire, intense interest, love, devotion, and noble attachment are essential for genuine interest in Dharma. Without them, Dharma practice becomes a dry, mechanical, and lifeless activity like "plastering on mud". It lacks the joy and satisfaction. Just as the sweetness of a pond filled with nectar is only experienced by the thirsty, the true sweetness of Dharma is only experienced by those who are truly hungry for it. Therefore, a genuine desire, longing, and attraction for Dharma are essential. This is the first requirement for a true seeker. 
2. **Kritarth-Shrutajnani:** He is a knower of the scriptures and has achieved his goal.
3. **Samyagjnani and Samyagrusti:** He is a perfect knower and has attained perfect faith.
4. **Vikalpa due to distractions:** Despite all this, he still experiences distractions and delusions.

**Desire to practice Dharma:** The first requirement is that the seeker must have a true, genuine, selfless, innocent, and disinterested desire to practice Dharma. Just as in worldly affairs, any action begins with a desire, similarly, in the pursuit of liberation, the first step is to cultivate a true desire to practice Dharma. This deep desire, intense interest, love, devotion, and noble attachment are essential for genuine interest in Dharma. Without them, Dharma practice becomes a dry, mechanical, and lifeless activity like "plastering on mud". It lacks the joy and satisfaction. Just as the sweetness of a pond filled with nectar is only experienced by the thirsty, the true sweetness of Dharma is only experienced by those who are truly hungry for it. Therefore, a genuine desire, longing, and attraction for Dharma are essential. This is the first requirement for a true seeker. 

What is the desire of a true seeker? "Their desire is for the pure, original Atmapad (Self-realization) and the pure Dharma and liberation. A seeker does not have any other desire. Their only goal is the Self. They have no other mental desires. The seeker desires the infinite bliss of the original, pure Atmapad, the true form of the Jina." "Their desire is for the Self, not for anything else."

"My dear friend, I urge you to cultivate a desire to become a seeker. Make the thirsty thirsty. Arouse the curiosity of the non-thirsty to become thirsty." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

(14) The Gadakitasamudaya, Shri Pratikraman, and other sutras, many of them begin with the word "chchhami" or "ra" which are indicative of desire. The reason behind this is that every religious action should begin with desire. For example, "Suchchhami varamalo, suzazarena sanhisadu mavan" etc. Similarly, the mangalacharan of this text also mentions this desire, implicitly suggesting that desire is the mangalacharan of yoga, the first step of yoga, the gateway to yoga. And this religious desire should be completely innocent, free from Maya; it should not be hypocritical, deceitful, or pretentious, it should not be a facade for personal gain. Only then can it be called true religious desire or liberation. "Free from deceit, surrender yourself, the path of Anandghan..." - Shri Anandghanji. "The weak, the naked, and the fasting, who are colored by Maya; they too will take infinite births, they are another limb." - Shri Yashovijayji's "Saada Tinsoo Gatha" Stotra. "Aatmarthina tatas tyajyo dambho'narthanibandhanam // Shudva yadanumootchettyan pratipaditam" - Shri Yashovijayji's Adhyatmasar. Meaning - Therefore, one should abandon hypocrisy, which is the cause of evil, for the sake of the soul. The pure, simple man is pure, as stated in the scriptures. 2. Shrutagyan - Secondly, one should have Shrutagyan. One should have heard the meaning of the scriptures from a Sadguru or a Saltamra. One should have knowledge of the scriptures, Shrutagyan. Here, "Shravan" does not mean merely listening to the words through the ears, but also understanding the meaning with feeling. This is true Shravan. Because the name of that which reveals the truth is Artha or Agama-Shruta. Therefore, one who listens to this Artha-Agama-Shruta also listens to its meaning, which is easily understood. "Kayotsargadisatraanam shraddhaamedhadibhavatha // Ichchadiyogesa phalayam deshasarvavrataspruasam //" - Shri Adhyatmasar. "Hiassa jaha khanam avi vicchijjai nev bhoane ichcha. Evam mokkhatthina chhijjai ichcha na kajjam mi." - Shri Yashovijayji's Yatilkshanasamucchya.

##  Translation:

**Icchayag (15) 3.**  Even though one may possess Samyagdasti (right faith), Jnana (knowledge) and Shastrajnana (scriptural knowledge), and know all the Agamas, they may still be ignorant. Therefore, the term "Jnani" (knowledgeable) is specifically used for Icchayag, emphasizing the importance of Samyagdasti. An Icchayag is a Samyagudashti (right faith) purusha (man), an Atmajnan (self-realized) individual who has attained Samyagjnana (right knowledge). Without Samyagdarshan (right vision), all knowledge is considered ignorance.  

Even though one may have crossed the ocean of scriptures and become a learned Vibudh (wise), if they do not know the true nature of the Ishta (the object of worship) that is worthy of being practiced, they are still considered ignorant.  

Just as the Vibudh (deity) churned the ocean with Mount Mandara to obtain the precious jewel and the nectar of immortality, as described in the Puranas, similarly, in the context of Adhyatma (spiritual knowledge), the Vibudh (learned) churns the ocean of scriptures with the Mandarachal (Mount Mandara) of Adhyatma Shastra (spiritual scriptures). If they do not attain the Atmatattva (self-realization), the nectar of immortality, their wisdom remains ignorance. 

The fifth Anga (scripture), Shri Bhagavati Sutra, clearly states: "Even if one has studied for nine previous births, but does not know the Jiva (soul), they are ignorant."  

"Even if one has studied for nine previous births, but does not know the Jiva, they are considered ignorant, as the Agamas testify. This is a special statement about all the previous scriptures. To purify the Jiva, the Jina (liberated soul) calls it knowledge, let all the noble ones listen. Knowledge is not found in scriptures, nor in the cleverness of poets, nor in mantras and tantras, nor in language. Knowledge is not found in any other place. Knowledge is an art in the Jnani (knowledgeable), the Jina calls it knowledge, let all the noble ones listen." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. 

Therefore, an Icchayag "Jnani" purusha must possess Atmajnan (self-realization). An Icchayag purusha is a Samyagdasti, Samyagdarshni, and Atmajnan.

**4.**  **Pramadjanaya Vikalata (Disturbance due to carelessness):**  Although an Icchayag Samyagdrushti Atmajnan has overcome the obstacle of Darshan (vision), there is still a possibility of Charitra (conduct) being affected. Therefore, they do not yet possess a completely undisturbed state of Atmasthiti (self-stability) and an unbroken Charitra (conduct) that is in harmony with the Atma (soul). This is because Pramad (carelessness) can lead to a deviation from the Atmaswaroop (true nature of the soul), and occasions of Vikatha (idle talk) and other forms of Pramad can affect their Charitra. 

* "Adhyatmashastra Namamithivara: Muya Kulnarne Prant Vivurdharna Vim Shri Yashovijayajikrit Adhyatmasar"

(16) The collection of right views (Samyagdrishti) is prone to flaws, and therefore it is called a flaw-ridden practice of yoga-dharma. Due to this flaw, it is affected by excesses and faults in the form of time-discipline (Kaal-Vinaya), knowledge-conduct (Jnanaachar), etc. Here, "pramad" does not simply mean laziness; rather, it refers to anything that causes a living being to deviate from its true self (Atmaswaroop) and leads to corruption. This is a broad meaning. There are five main types of "pramad" that corrupt the true nature of a living being: (1) Pride (Mad), (2) Objects of attachment (Vishay), (3) Passions (Kashaya), (4) Sleep (Nidra), (5) Idle talk (Vikatha). Alternatively, there are eight categories: (1) Ignorance (Ajnan), (2) Doubt (Sanshay), (3) False knowledge (Mithyajnan), (4) Attachment (Raag), (5) Aversion (Dvesha), (6) Delusion (Matibhramsha), (7) Disrespect for Dharma, (8) Misuse of mind, speech, and body. Due to this "pramad," there is a possibility of damage to the proper observance of the five conducts (Panchaachar) of knowledge-conduct (Jnanaachar), etc. However, for a seeker (Mumukshu) who desires liberation, this desire is essential. Therefore, they constantly have an inner desire to perform the duties of the path (Dharma-Kartavya), and they also engage in activities based on that desire. Their pursuit of Dharma continues. Because others, who are of a common nature, are lazy and prone to "pramad," a wise person does not indulge in such laziness. They do not sit idly like a creeper. They have gone far beyond ordinary people because their passions (Kashaya) have become subtle, their interest in and attachment to objects of attachment (Vishay) have weakened, and their attachment, aversion, and other forms of "pramad" have diminished. After knowing and understanding their true self, a wise person with right views (Samyagdrishti) strives to eliminate "pramad" through effort and pursuit. However, as long as there is even a trace of "pramad" arising due to the aforementioned reasons, they are still considered "pramadi" (prone to "pramad"). As the faults of "pramad" are eliminated, their true state (Atmasthiti) and self-awareness (Atmadasha) increase, and their desire (Ichcha) becomes stronger. Thus, based on the gradual reduction of "pramad," a seeker with right views (Samyagdrishti) and self-knowledge (Atmajnan) is categorized into three stages: (1) Avirati Samyagdrishti, (2) Deshvirati Samyagdrishti (Bhavasravak), (3) Sarvavirati Samyagdrishti (Bhavasadhu).

**Icchaag (17)** “Pamaayam karmamaa hansu appamaayam tahaavaram / Tadmaavaano vaari vaaru uchiv va” – Shri Sutrakrutanga, Pramada is called karma by Tirthankaradeva, and Apramada is called Atmaswaroop, which is the other, i.e., Akarma. The ignorant and the knowledgeable are of this type of distinction.” – Shrimati Rajchandra. Thus, the four characteristics of Icchaag are mentioned, these characteristics are interconnected. (1) First, it generates the desire for Dharma, (2) then, to know its form, it is heard from the mouth of Shri Sadguru, (3) after hearing the correct meaning, knowledge is gained, (4) even after gaining knowledge, due to Pramada, there is a deviation in character. And thus, this Icchaayeegi Purush – (1) is truly a Dharma seeker, a true Mumukshu, from the soul, (2) is a Shastrashrota-Shrutajna, (1) is a Samyagdristi Atmajnaani, (4) yet is still Pramadawant-Pramatt. Moreover, here, with the excellence of words, the Shastrakar Maharshi has included the karmachang bhakti and the aspect of knowledge in ‘Icchaag’ with great skill. It is of this type – (1) the word ‘katum’ signifies the acceptance of karmavega, (2) the word ‘Iccha’ indicates bhaktiyoga, (3) and the word ‘jnaani’ indicates jnanag. In addition, it is also to be understood that – if one has taken up the main task of Maaksasadhan, which is pervasive, even if one is Pramadawant, if one does it even a little bit with karma-sange, with feet, without deviation, with purity, then he is also included in this Icchaag. And here, the main thing is Iccha, so it is to be understood from above, by implication, that – even if there is a true, unblemished desire to do pure Dharma-karma, then it is also included in Icchaayeegi, by way of treatment, in practice. x “Saangamapyek karma pratipanne pramadinah / Naazayogi rut vaatr mate 1 – Shri Yashovijayajikrit Katrishat Dwaarvishika. * “Tattpanchamagunastanaadaarabhyaivaitadiच्छति / Nishchay kayavaharattu poorvamgavaavarat chhe”—-Shri Adhyatmasar, etc.

(18) With the desire to know the form of the *Yogadrishtisamurchya Shastra*, it is said - *Shastrayoga* is to be known here as much as possible by the non-negligent / The *Shraddhakya* there is intense, with the *Vachana* (scripture) / 4 / The second *Shraddha* is according to the ability of the non-negligent, with intense *Mrutbedha* (understanding of the scriptures), and it is also *Avikala* (unbroken), 4 / Meaning: - And *Shastrayoga* is to be known here by the *Shraddhavant* (devotee) who is non-negligent as much as possible; and it is done by the intense *Mrutbedha* of the *Agam* (scripture) and (by the *Avikala* of time etc.) it is *Avikala* (unbroken). In this commentary, the form of the second "Shastrayoga" has been clearly stated in the terminology of the *Gashashtra*. *Shastrapradhan* is *Shastrayoga*. Where the *Shastra* is the main thing, that *Shastra* is called *Shastrayoga*. In this *Shastrayoga*, there is so much intensity - sharpness of *Agam* knowledge - *Mrutbedha*, so much skill - expertise - proficiency, that it is *Avikala* (unbroken) by *Shastra* knowledge. And due to such *Shastra* proficiency, there is also knowledge of even the most subtle *Atichara* (transgression) *Dosha* (fault) here, and that *Dosha* is removed with subtle *Upga* (effort) and self-awareness. Therefore, *Jnanaachar* (conduct of knowledge), *Darshanaachar* (conduct of vision), *Charitraachar* (conduct of character), *Tapaachar* (conduct of austerity), and *Vichar* (conduct of thought) - these five *Aachar* (conduct) are followed properly, even in their subtle forms like time, *Vinaya* (discipline) etc. Therefore, this *Shastrayoga* is also *Avikala* (unbroken), without any defect, *Niratichar* (without transgression). 

**Explanation of the terms:**

* **Yogadrishtisamurchya Shastra:** A Jain scripture that deals with the principles of *Yoga* and *Drisht* (vision).
* **Shastrayoga:** The practice of *Yoga* based on the teachings of the scriptures.
* **Shraddhakya:** A person who has *Shraddha* (faith) in the scriptures.
* **Avikala:** Unbroken, continuous, without any interruption.
* **Mrutbedha:** Understanding of the scriptures.
* **Agam:** The Jain scriptures.

(19) To whom does this Shastra belong? What kind of person possesses it? It belongs to the one who is devoted to the Shraddha, who is diligent to the best of their ability. Thus, a Shastri Purusha (1) is one who has a deep understanding of the Shastra, (2) is devoted to the Shraddha, (3) is diligent to the best of their ability. In this way, one who has a deep understanding of the Shastra, has a sharp understanding of the principles of this Shastra. Due to their sharp intellect, they have a deep understanding of the subtle and profound secrets of the Shastra. Shastra is the word of the Shastra Purusha, the authoritative person. The Shastra is that which governs the Jiva, giving them instructions regarding actions and their consequences, and through its pure governance, protects the Jiva from the fear of the world. This is the etymological meaning of "Shastra," and such a Shastra can only be the word of the pure, non-attached, omniscient being, and not of anyone else. "Shaananaatraalaraajesh: Raann Nikr | Vachanam Veetaraagasy Tacha Naanyasya Kasyachit //" - Shri Yashovijayji Kaniit Adhyatma Panishad. It is very difficult to cross this ocean of Shastra. Even the greatest minds get tired in it, or get lost and fall into delusion. This ocean of Shastra is the "difficulty of the Jina's teachings." Through the grace and support of the Shri Sadguru, through the Guru's guidance, this difficult Agam becomes easy. "Jina Pravachan Dugamyaata, Thaake Ati Matimaan; Avalamban Shri Sashuru, Sugam Ane Sukh Khaan." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. "Mahamaatibhinishaeshasiddhantapathpaaragai:.। Kriyate Yatra Digmohastatra Ko'nyah Prasarpati  /  / " - Shri Shubhachandraacharyaji's Shri Gyaanarnava. Even this difficult Agam-Sagar, through the grace of the Shri Sadguru, has been crossed, its profound knowledge has been attained, and the secret of all Shrautas is to know and recognize the pure soul. "Dvaadashaangi 4 Shri Jineshvare Kahi Chhe, Temaan Pan Ek Aatma J Aadey-Grahan Karva Yogya Chhe, Ane Baaki Beeju Badhu Hey-Tyajva Gya Chhe." This is the ultimate essence, the main point. Such knowledge of Bhava-Shruta, "Vatta Ninaitkramen, Shratan Todayanemeant Tasminnupadeyataya Chidaatma, Sheshan Tu Heyatvadhiyaaabhyadhaayi //" - Padhi Panchvinshatika.

The collection of scriptures, or *Gadasti Samuchaya*, is the pure knowledge of the self, which constantly plays in the heart of the scripture-knower, and has become extremely fruitful. Thus, with the intense penetration of the material-emotional condition, this scripture-knower is a man of *Samyagudashti*, a knower of scriptures. "He who goes to the good, only his self is pure / The Lekapradeepkar Rishis call him *Shrutakevali* // He who knows all the good knowledge, the Jin Bhagwan calls him *Shrutakevali*. Knowledge is all his self, therefore he is *Shrutakevali*." - Shri Kundakundaacharya's Shri Samyasar. "If you don't have the *nadu*, then you have all the knowledge, if you don't have all the *nadu*, then you have a lot of *gajaru*." - Shri Acharangasutra.  He who knows the pure self through *kritavada*, is called *Shrutakevali* by the Lekapradeepkar Rishis. And he who knows all the *shruta* knowledge is called *Shrutakevali* by the Jin Bhagwan, because all knowledge is his self, therefore he is *Shrutakevali*. He who knows one (the self) knows all, he who knows all, knows one (the self)." And thus, because of the intense penetration of *shruta* knowledge, this scripture-knower, a wise man, can act with subtle *amepag* and *paga* - constantly with self-awareness, without any doubt. And that is why this scripture is called *avikal* and *akhand*. *Shraddha* - *Shraddhanant* - This scripture-knower is *shraddhavant*, he has faith. What is the use of knowledge if there is no faith? But this scripture-knower has intense perception, he has faith in the ultimate goal, the truth, the self, the *apta* *agama*, and the faith in the true *sadguru* and the true *satpurusha*. Thus, it is clear that he is a man of *Samyagdarshan*. And the faith of the scripture-knower is *sampraatyayatmika* - *samyag* truth perception, or other types of *ajnapradhan*. *Sampraatyayatmika* faith is the faith that arises from the *samyag* perception of the truth, from true certainty. Such faith arises from the proper examination and testing of the truth (searching investigation), like gold is tested. *Kash-ched* - "Faith is the mother of the nectar of immortality! The eight-limbed *samyagdarshan* is free from the three types of ignorance." - Shri Samantabhadracharya's Shri Ratnakarandi Shravakachar.

**(21) Just as gold is tested by heat, so the eternal form of the Suvarna is examined by discerning men. And since this scholar is a man of sharp intellect, strong in his ability to understand, and endowed with great brilliance, he is extremely suitable for carrying out such an examination. This is the type of cross-section-heat test - just as an army is first tested on a touchstone, so he examines whether a particular scriptural injunction is valid (whether it is a true principle) or not. This is the cross-section test. Perhaps the gold may appear fine on the surface, but there may be deception or adulteration inside, perhaps the army is gold on the outside but brass inside, how would one know? Therefore, it is cross-sectioned, cut open, and in doing so, any flaws are revealed. Similarly, this examining man verifies whether the scriptural injunctions presented are truly reflected in the actions described within. This is the cross-section test. Perhaps the gold passes the initial test, but its examination is not yet complete, because those who adulterate are so cunning that they mix another metal (alloy) with the gold, atom by atom. This is tested by heating the gold; by the heat of fire, the gold is melted, and its impurities are revealed. Similarly, the examiner, relying on all knowledge, with a strong intellect like fire, scrutinizes the scriptures, tests the scriptures, and examines whether there are any impurities or flaws in the meaning. This is the heat test. Thus, through cross-section and heat, this discerning man examines the gold of the scriptures; and he does so without any attachment to any particular opinion or view, with utmost impartiality, solely based on the principles. Like an honest judge, upholding justice, he examines without any bias, with a pure heart. By carrying out such an examination, he arrives at the true conclusion - the principle - "क्षति वछेर्ता: सा वथा ज्ञनाः | शws वलवाशुद्धि पलंत तथा वुधाः " etc. (For details, see) - Shri Yashovijayji-krit Adhyatma Upanishad, क "साक्षात् वत्तविवारेy निषत्रावनिमः | विभजन्ति गुणान् दोषान् धन्याः स्वच्छेन चेतसा  // " - Shri Shubhachandracharya-krit Shri Gnanarnava. "पक्षपात न मे वीरे. न दृष' पाgि त्तिम वरनं , ता # guहा" - Paramnaya-murti Shri Haribhadrasuri.**

(22) The collection of **gadapshti** is determined, and thus it generates a precise inner faith that is firmly established in the heart, with **samyak praiti** (right perception) and real conviction. This is called **sampraatyayatmika shraddha** (faith based on understanding). Alternatively, this faith can also be of another type, **aajna pradhan** (based on command). Some individuals are **apt** (worthy), trustworthy, and reliable. This faith arises from the **purusha praman** (authority of the person) of such **aajna pradhan** individuals. And this **apt shraddha** (faith in the worthy) can only be from a **nirdosh** (blameless), **nirvikar** (passionless), **vitrag** (free from attachments) individual, who is free from **rag** (attachment), **dvesh** (aversion), **meh** (affection), and other **doshas** (faults). Therefore, the word of such a **apt purusha** (worthy person) is the ultimate authority, worthy of ultimate faith, and deserving of **tahatti** (acceptance). This is because it is believed that the truth spoken by a **vitrag** is **tatvasum** (true and complete), cannot be refuted by any arguments, and is **aajna grahya** (worthy of acceptance based on command), because a **vitrag** would not speak otherwise. Therefore, it is not appropriate to allow even a seed of doubt to sprout in the word of a **vitrag**. Due to the limitations of time, the severance of excellent knowledge, the dullness of intellect, or any other reason, this truth may not be understood by me. However, the **ahant bhagvant** (the enlightened one) has not spoken even a fraction of anything that is **maya yukta** (illusory) or false. Because they were **niragi** (free from attachment), **tyagi** (renouncer), and **nisprihi** (devoid of desire). They had no reason to speak falsely. Moreover, being **sarvagya** (omniscient) and **sarvadashi** (all-pervasive), they would not speak falsely even out of ignorance. "Whose word is true to be accepted? Believe the statement of the blameless person who has experienced it." The seed of doubt will not sprout within, for those who understand the words of the **Jina**, their kingdom is always my desire, I will strive to attain liberation. - **Shrimad Rajchandraji**'s **Shri Moksha Mala**. This is also the firm conviction of Rajchandra's mind; "We will become the form that is commanded by the Lord... a unique opportunity." - **Shrimad Rajchandraji**. "Without **aajna aradhana** (worship of the command), how can **guna siddhi** (spiritual perfection) be attained?" "Charity, austerity, conduct, and vows, without the grace of the Lord, become obstacles and cause worldly attachments." "Devchandra plays in the **aanama** (formless), his excellence is known throughout the world." - **Shri Devchandraji**. *"The subtle truth revealed by the **Jina** cannot be refuted by any arguments. It is worthy of acceptance based on command, because the **Jina** would not speak otherwise."* - **Alap Padhdhati**. *"That alone is the truth, without any doubt, which is spoken by the **Jina**."* - **Shri Acharangasutra**.

(23) Thus, the man who is devoted to the command considers the command of the Lord as the most important, placing it on his head, and that is the way, he believes. And this devotion to the command is not just any ordinary thing, it is "Sarvasampakari" - fulfilling all purposes. It destroys self-will, brings about the strong support of the Supreme Being, and has many other benefits. Also, it is not that there is a lack of examination in it, it is also present in it to the best of one's ability. Although the devotion of the one who is devoted to the examination is stronger, the ability to examine in that way is not the goal of everyone. Only a rare, capable, and self-controlled man can do it, and even they do not abandon the reliance on the command, they only try to make it known while keeping it in mind. In any case, the scholar must have true faith (Sampratyayatmak) in the correct principle. And this is extremely essential. Because until such faith is established, true faith does not arise, an indelible "impression" is not made in the soul, until then, knowing and doing everything becomes like "plastering on mud." What is the purity of God, Guru, and Dharma? What is it? It does not bring pure faith; without pure faith, whatever actions are performed, they are like plastering on mud. The beauty of the sword, the beauty of the fourteenth Tirthankara's feet." - Shri Anandghanji And this faith is extremely rare. Shri Uttaradhyayanasutra says, "Faith is extremely rare. Humanity, action, faith, and restraint - these four are increasingly rare in beings." "Sadhdhan Parmahurja!" "Chattari paramanghani dullhahaniha jantune / Manunatt guru dhdha sanayammi virachan" - Shri Uttaradhyayanasutra Here, the scholar has already attained faith and faith, which is shown here by the two adjectives "Tivra Mrutbedhaval" and "Shraddha." Now, to show how his self-power shines in restraint, it is said that - to the best of his ability, he is diligent - and it is because he is faithful that this scholar is diligent. True, unwavering faith that has spread throughout the bones and marrow, after that, he acts with indomitable enthusiasm, full zeal, and diligence in that way, what is surprising? Because -

---------------------------
(24) The faith and knowledge that are grasped by the *Gadastisamuccaya*, those are the actions that are performed...O merciful one! When the action, the interest, and the doer become one, the cause and effect are reversed...O merciful one! The soul dwells in its own home, and its own home becomes auspicious...O merciful one, I pray to the *Yugamandhar*... - As Shri Devchandraji and the above explanation have stated, the state of the soul being corrupted and distracted from its true nature is called " *pramad* ". The one who is not *pramad*, who remains in the state of the soul's true nature, is called *apramat* or *apramadi*. This *apramat* soul is free from *mad*, *vishaya*, *kashaya*, *vikath*, *raga-dvesha*, etc., types of *pramad*. Because it resides in the high, *nilenpa*, *udasina*, pure state of the soul, which *pramad* cannot touch; and in that state, it is eternally immersed, eternally satisfied and content, and in that state, it attains supreme happiness. Where can there be *prasad* for such a soul-contented soul? The worldly, sensual, *indriya-rami* is bound, the *muni* is *atma-rami* in virtue; the one who is primarily *atma-rami* is called *nishkama*... - Shri Shreyansth, Shri Anandghanji. This *atma-rami* soul is extremely *atma-payagavant*, constantly in self-awareness, and does not allow anything to interfere with the pure substance-emotion observance of the five great vows, does not allow even a trace of transgression in the five conducts, behaves without *raga-dvesha* in the five objects, properly observes the five *samiti-trigupti*, etc., defeats the four *kashayas* of anger, etc., keeps all *pramad* conduct far away, and remains in a state of equanimity everywhere, performing all actions according to the scriptures. According to the scriptures, the one who performs *bhavik* actions is known by his pure character... - Shri Anandghanji. And how this ideal substance-emotion *nirgath* *apramat* yogi acts with great courage in destroying the *charitra-meha*, the previous poem, which presents a very beautiful word-picture of this, cannot be resisted from being quoted here: "With all emotions, he makes the attitude of *udasinya*, only the body is for the purpose of restraint, nothing else is conceived for any other reason, even in the body, not even a little bit of *mooch* is accepted... When will such an unprecedented opportunity come? When will we become *bahiyantrar* *nigranth*? When the *darshan-meha* is overcome and the *upa-bodh* is attained, the knowledge of the pure consciousness that is different from the body; therefore, by rejecting the *charitra-meha*, the contemplation of the pure form is practiced... - *aprava*

##  Scriptural Self-Stability: Three Concise Points

**Firstly**, observe this stability in the body: even in the face of severe trials or fearsome obstacles, it remains unshaken. This stability is the result of unwavering restraint, fueled by the pursuit of the ultimate goal, and guided by the teachings of the Jinas. It is a state that, moment by moment, gradually diminishes, ultimately merging into one's true nature.

**Secondly**, observe this stability in the five senses: free from attachment and aversion, it remains undisturbed by the five distractions. It transcends the limitations of matter, space, and time, and is characterized by a constant state of equanimity.

**Thirdly**, observe this stability in one's nature: towards anger, it exhibits a gentle disposition; towards pride, it displays humility; towards delusion, it maintains a state of witnessing; towards greed, it remains free from greed itself. Towards those who inflict suffering, it harbors no ill will; even towards the cycle of birth and death, it remains unattached. It transcends the limitations of the body, and is characterized by a strong foundation of unwavering determination.

**Furthermore**, observe this stability in one's actions: it is characterized by nakedness, shaved head, and abstinence from bathing, tooth-brushing, etc. It is free from hair, beard, nails, or any other bodily adornment, and is a testament to the restraint and discipline of the Nigrantha.

**Moreover**, observe this stability in one's attitude: towards enemies and friends alike, it maintains equanimity. It remains unaffected by honor or dishonor, and is characterized by a pure and unwavering equanimity in the face of life and death, and throughout the cycle of existence.

**Finally**, observe this stability in one's conduct: it is characterized by solitude, wandering in cremation grounds, or dwelling in mountains alongside tigers and lions. It is characterized by a steady posture and a mind free from agitation, and is a testament to the attainment of the ultimate friend.

**Furthermore**, observe this stability in one's inner state: it is characterized by a mind free from agitation, both in the midst of austerity and in the face of pleasure. It views dust particles and celestial beings, as well as the riches and flying chariots of the gods, with the same equanimity, recognizing them all as mere particles of matter.

**Ultimately**, observe this stability in one's resolve: it is characterized by the complete eradication of the attachment to virtue, and is a testament to the attainment of an extraordinary state of being. It is characterized by a pure and unwavering focus, and is a testament to the attainment of the highest state of being.

**Srimad Rajchandraji**, with unwavering determination, strives to overcome the attachment to virtue, utilizing all his strength and resources. He is committed to the destruction of the enemy of joy, with unwavering dedication and determination. He is fully engaged in this endeavor, with unwavering resolve. The phrase "to the best of one's ability" is used here with a specific purpose. It signifies acting according to one's capacity, without exceeding it. It implies two things:

1. **Not exceeding one's capacity:** This means not acting beyond one's limits, and not exceeding one's capabilities. It implies refraining from impossible actions, and acting within the limits of one's mental, verbal, and physical capabilities.
2. **Acting according to one's capacity:** This means utilizing all one's available strength and resources. It implies acting in accordance with one's capabilities, and utilizing all one's potential.

---------------------------
(26) Having spent all the accumulated wealth, one should perform [spiritual practices] with all one's soul, without hiding any strength. To perform without hiding the strength and vigor of the father, the non-destructive, is to perform to the best of one's ability. Thus, this scriptural man is (1) sharp-witted, (2) faithful, (3) diligent to the best of his ability. Here, "sharp-witted" implies right knowledge, "faithful" implies right faith, and "diligent" implies right conduct. Thus, this scriptural man is the best devotee-practitioner of the path to liberation, which is in the form of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. And such a man's scripture is unwavering and unbroken. The characteristic of *samarthyayoga* is stated: 

"The means indicated by the scripture, and that which goes beyond it, 
Due to the strength of the power, especially, this is the best, 
Called *samarthyayoga*." (5)

Meaning: That which is indicated as a means by the scripture, and which is beyond even that scripture, due to the strength of the power, is this *samarthyayoga*, which is the best.

**Commentary:** Now, the form of the third *samaga* is described here. *Samaga* means the *samarthyayoga*-dominant stage. It is said that the *atmasamarthya* - the strength of the soul - is the main thing in this stage. The scripture states that the *samarthyayoga* is the means, because its statement in the scripture is general. 

**Explanation:** That which is beyond the scripture, due to the strength of the power, is beyond the scripture. (That which goes beyond even the scripture. Why? It is said that due to the strength of the power, it is beyond the scripture, due to its strength and power. It is beyond the scripture, especially, not generally. Because the scripture is general in its nature. This *samarthyayoga* is the best, the most important. Because due to its being the cause of liberation, it quickly and directly leads to the fruit of liberation.

---------------------------
There are 27 **Saachdhyog** (auspicious conjunctions), and their name is **Samarthya** (power). This **Yug** (era) is the best of all **Yugs**. There are two characteristics of this **Yug**: (1) The remedy is generally shown in the scriptures, (2) This **Yug** is more focused on the subject than the scriptures themselves, due to the strength of power. This is how it is: The scriptures show the remedy for this **Samarthya**, but they only show it generally, not specifically. In this, the purpose of the scriptures is only guidance and direction. Just as a knowledgeable person who asks for directions on a road, the one who shows the way points with a general finger, but does not guide them all the way, similarly, the scriptures also guide the **Mumukṣu** (aspirant) in this **Yogmarg** (path of yoga) generally, saying, "Look! If you do this remedy, you will achieve the desired goal." But it is the **Mumukṣu** with a pure mind who walks on that path according to the instructions and makes the effort to travel. And because they do this, they continue to progress further and further on the **Yogmarg**, attaining higher and higher states of self-realization. And as they do this, they also surpass the limitations of the scriptures, and they continue to move forward, attaining subjects that are beyond the scriptures, subjects that are not known to the scriptures. Because the scriptures only show the path generally up to a certain point, saying, "Go in this direction with this **Atmasamarthya** (self-power)." Then, it is up to the **Samarthya** to progress further, to know the form of the path with their own **Atmasamarthya**. And this kind of ability to progress, this **Samarthya**, this power, has come to this **Yogi**. This **Vihang** (bird) who flies freely in the sky has developed so much **Atmabal** (inner strength) that it is able to fly high at will on its own. Therefore, it moves rapidly on the path of progress, and as it progresses further, it sees the path ahead directly, the path that was visible from afar becomes clear as it approaches, and what is directly perceived through **Atmaanubhav** (self-experience) is clearly visible. In this, what other help does it need besides **Atmasamarthya**? Thus, this **Samarth** (powerful) **Yogi** has found the true path directly, and doubt has been removed, so they move forward fearlessly, without any doubt, with firm determination, with the **Atmabal** that they have cultivated through their own efforts, conquering the peaks of the mountains one by one, and climbing higher and higher. * "**Vifa Varṇita Śāśanamati: Pathi .. Jñānavō Yugota Iśeṣoparapa – Śrī Yaśovijayajīkṛta Adhyātmapaniṣad**"

---------------------------
(28) The collection of virtues, the *gadashtis*, ultimately reaches the peak of the *yoga-giri* (mountain of yoga), and a sound arises within its soul, saying, "The path is found, doubts are dispelled; those waters are gone, the self is distinct." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. Such a *samarthya-yogi* (capable yogi) has the strength to move forward due to his self-power. He possesses such immense self-power, cultivated through restraint, that it overflows. The source of this overflowing power, this accumulation of energy, is his consistent practice of *yoga* according to the ideal *shakti* (power) method. He has accumulated immense power through the *yoga* of self-restraint. Because before reaching this stage of *samarthya-yogi*, he first became truly desirous. He attained *ichchha* (desire), *shravana* (hearing), etc., achieved *samyagdarshan* (right vision), and attained self-knowledge. But he still had a degree of *pramada* (distraction) in his character and restraint. He was a *pramatt yogi* (distracted yogi). Then he became a *shastra-yogi* (scriptural yogi). Having known the complete secrets of the scriptures, he became extremely devout and free from distraction, a *samyat yogi* (restrained yogi). Thus, he progressively increased his restraint. He stopped the dissipation of the soul's energy, which was being wasted by the *pramatt yoga* of mind, speech, and body. He restrained the soul as much as possible in its true form, keeping it restrained, and thus accumulated immense self-power (mobilization). Even now, as he journeys on the path of *yoga* in this *samarthya-yogi* stage, he remains intensely self-confident, continuously increasing his infinite restraint and accumulating intense self-power. This generates an outburst of power within him, and the power that does not fit within his body propels him forward. "The power of restraint, you said, is the mark of a wise and skillful person; the seeker, with a heart full of the object of attainment, plays his own role. Our mind is captivated by the Lord's qualities. Unbound by desire, he becomes unbound by non-desire; abiding in the one principle, he contains the perishable power..." - Shri Devchandraji. "Gradually, restraint touches him, he attains the perishable state; the series of restraints blossoms, he worships the liberated state." - Shri Yashovijayaji. And such a *samarthya-yogi* is the best, the chief, in all ages. 

Page #95:
---------------------------
**Samarthya Yoga (29) is the best. Because the definition of the word Yoga is that which is with Moksha. Accordingly, this Samarthya Yoga, without delay, without wasting time, is with the best fruit, which is Moksha, and quickly becomes the cause of liberation. Therefore, this Samarthya Yoga is the supreme Yoga, the Jagat Shiromani, the peak of the Agapravata. In support of this, it is said - Siddhyakhyapad-samprapti-hetu-bheda na tattvatah / Shastradeva-avagamyante, sarvathaiva-iha yogibhih // 6 // Siddhi-pad-prapti-hetu-bheda, tattvatah, ahi; matra shastra-thi ja sarvatha, gamya gine nahi, 6. Meaning - The differences in the causes of attaining the state called Siddhi are not known to the Yogis from the scriptures, but only from the scriptures. In support of the above discussion, it is said here that - the causes of attaining the state of Siddhi, such as Samyak-darshan, knowledge, and conduct, are not known to the Yogis, the true saints, and the virtuous, only through the scriptures. The limitation of the scriptures is that some types can be known from the scriptures, but not all. Because the differences in these causes of Samyak-darshan, etc., are infinite, which is beyond speech, "where speech returns from." Therefore, the scriptures are not all-powerful in relation to attaining liberation, nor are they useless. Some types of Samyak-darshan, etc., which are the causes of Moksha, can be known from the scriptures, but not all. Thus, the scriptures are not useless, nor are they all-powerful, they are a guide to a certain extent. Therefore, further, one has to grow through experience, the friend, and the self-power, which is Samarthya Yoga. That is the meaning. Where the scriptures end, Samarthya Yoga begins. Because, Kriti Siddhi-yara Karitu-mera - the differences in the causes of attaining the state called Siddhi, the special causes of attaining the state called Moksha - Samyak-darshan, etc. What? That is - tattvatah - not from the true nature, from the ultimate truth. Ratri Desavakyant - from the scriptures only. And yet, the scriptures are not useless, not useless, not useless, therefore it is said - sarvave chommi - all here, to the Yogis, that is, all types here - in this world, to the saints, are not known; because the differences in these causes of Samyak-darshan, etc., are infinite.** 

Page #96:
---------------------------
(30) The collection of scriptures known as *Gadasti* does not go beyond providing direction. It simply says, "Brother, go in this direction in this way."  This is the extent of the guidance that the scriptures offer to the capable *yogi*. They cannot speak of the unspeakable. Therefore, the capable *yogi* must rely on the power of *jnanayoga* - the knowledge gained through self-realization. This *yoga* alone can lead him to the state of *kaivalya* (liberation). This experience, this friend, makes him a pure being, a pure consciousness, a true self.

"The scriptures only point the way, they do not go beyond that. It is *jnanayoga* that takes me to the other shore, not mere words!" - *Shri Adhyatma Panishad*

"The knowledge that remains only as experience... is a rare opportunity." - *Shrimad Rajchandraji*

"The scriptures show the way, but they cannot speak of the unspeakable. The path is clear, free from obstacles. Experience is the true guide." - *Veer Jineshwar Parmeshwar*

"Oh, the cleverness of experience! Oh, the joy of realization! The inner knowing, the divine within, keeps the path clear." - *Veer*

"Through experience, one finds the Lord. All desires are fulfilled. The state of liberation is attained through experience. The great *Mahavira* is a treasure of joy." - *Ogirāj Anandghanaji*

It is believed that all knowledge is ultimately derived from scriptures. This is a fallacy. 

"All knowledge is ultimately derived from direct experience, not from scriptures. The scriptures only serve as a guide. The realization of the true self, the knowledge of the all-knowing, and the attainment of liberation are all achieved through direct experience." - *Verse 7*

In other words, the scriptures are only a means to an end. The true goal is to achieve direct experience. This is the only way to attain liberation. 

Page #97:
---------------------------
(31) Therefore, when omniscience is attained, the attainment of the Siddhi-pad (state of liberation) also happens. 7, Meaning - The knowledge of Samyakdarshan (right faith) etc. is attained through scriptures, and this will be combined with the direct experience of the realization of the self. And when this happens, due to the attainment of the state of omniscience, the attainment of the Siddhi-pad will happen. (Thus, a contradiction arises).

Now, the contradiction arises when it is assumed that the knowledge of the cause of the attainment of the Siddhi-pad is attained through scriptures. This is explained here - 1) When this happens, there will be direct experience of all the emotions, (2) Therefore, omniscience will be attained, (3) And in the same way, liberation will also be attained by simply listening. (1) When all the types of Samyakdarshan etc. are known through scriptures, then all the emotions are realized, all the emotions are seen directly. (2) Therefore, after listening, the listener Yogi will attain omniscience! Knowing from scriptures - listening, immediately Kevalgyan! All other five-fold activities and confusion disappear! (3) And when this happens, at the time of listening, the attainment of the Siddhi-pad will also happen! Direct liberation will be attained! Because, the scriptures provide the opportunity to know the Ayogik-Kevali (liberated without effort). Therefore, according to the above logic, Siddhi should happen as soon as one knows! But this is not seen happening, and all this is directly contradictory, undesirable, and affected by the obstacles of the eight karmas. Because (1) All the emotions are not seen directly through scriptures, they are seen indirectly. The subject of Shrutagyan (scriptural knowledge) is indirect, not direct. (2) Thus, direct knowledge is not attained through scriptures, therefore, omniscience is not attained through them. (3) Similarly, the attainment of the Siddhi-pad is also not seen happening. Therefore, the principle is established that the objects of Samyakdarshan etc. cannot be known in all ways through scriptures. This is not derived from the knowledge of scriptures etc., but from experiential knowledge.

"It may be that Shrimad Rajchandraji will say this, but what is the harm in that? Therefore, it is said here - 

Page #98:
---------------------------
(32) **Gadastisamuccaya**  Not this way, because it is not possible to say that the **Samarthyayoga** is **avachy** (indescribable) which is associated with **Pratibhajnana** (intuitive knowledge) and is the means for **Sarvajnatva** (omniscience) etc. 8 //

**Meaning:**  This is not the case, because the **Samarthyayoga** which is associated with **Pratibhajnana** cannot be described as **avachy** (indescribable), as it is the means for **Sarvajnatva** (omniscience) etc. 

**Commentary:** Someone might say, "Well, if **siddhi** (liberation) is achieved through **shastra** (scripture) alone, what is the problem?" The answer is given here: "Brother, that is not the case. If **siddhi** were achieved through **shastra** alone, what problem would we have? What is more obvious than the direct contradiction? What is more crude than that? But it does not appear to be so, there is a contradiction in direct evidence. Because indirect knowledge of **agipana** (non-attachment) comes from **shastra**, but no one becomes truly **agipana** through it. This is because **agipana** and **kevalapana** (omniscience) are not achieved through **shastra** alone, but through **siddhi** (liberation). And because this is the case, the **Samarthyayoga** which is associated with **Pratibhajnana** (intuitive knowledge) and is **marganusari** (according to the path) and **prakrusht** (excellent) is **avachy** (indescribable). It is **samarthyapradhan** (powerful) and **yog** (practice). This is because the **kshayapashreni** (series of destruction) of **dharmavyapar** (religious activity) continues. This **Samarthyayoga** is **avachy** (indescribable), it cannot be described, it is **sanvedanasiddha** (experienced through the senses) and **atmanubhavgamya** (understandable through self-experience) for the **yogi** (practitioner). It is the means for **sarveshwasaadhan** (all-pervasive means) and **sarvajnatva** (omniscience) etc. It leads to **sarvottapana** (highest liberation) without delay. 

**Doubt:** Someone might doubt, "This **Pratibhajnana** (intuitive knowledge) is also **shrautjnana** (scriptural knowledge)." No, it is not **shrautjnana**, because it is a different kind of knowledge. And it is not **keval** (omniscience), because it is the result of **samayoga** (coincidence). 

**Conclusion:** The **siddhi** (liberation) is achieved through **shastra** (scripture) alone. This is not **shrautjnana** (scriptural knowledge), nor **keval** (omniscience), nor any other kind of knowledge. It is like the night, day, and dawn. Dawn is not different from night and day, nor is it one of the two. Similarly, this **Pratibhajnana** (intuitive knowledge) is not one of the two, nor is it one of the two. Because of the **utkrusht** (excellent) **kshayapashma** (destruction of karma) at that moment, it is **asambavyavaharya** (incomprehensible) in terms of **shrautjnana** (scriptural knowledge). And because of the **kshayopashma** (destruction of karma), it is not **keval** (omniscience) because it is not the subject of **ashesh** (all) **dravya-paryaya** (categories of matter). And this **Pratibhajnana** (intuitive knowledge) is **vachya** (describable) through words like **tarakjnana** (liberating knowledge) and **nirikshanjnana** (observational knowledge). It is also **ishta** (desirable) for others. Therefore, it is **adosh** (faultless). 

Page #99:
---------------------------
(23) I have not seen or heard of anyone attaining the state of liberation without a body, or reaching the state of Siddhi. And if there were a scripture through which direct knowledge of the past could be obtained, then that person should have directly attained the state of Siddhi. But that does not seem to be happening. And this is why the Samarthya Yoga is indescribable, cannot be spoken of, and is beyond the reach of scriptures. Because the subject of scriptures is indirect, and the subject of Samarthya Yoga is direct, that is, it is experienced by the soul, it is an indescribable realization. That is why this Samarthya Yoga has been called self-realized, experienced by the soul. This "G" refers to the category of Kshapaka, which is the Dharmavyapar, that is, the Dharmavyapar of the Samarthayogi who has initiated the Kshapaka series, who is engaged in the Dharma, which is the nature of the soul, is called Samarthya Yoga. In it, there is a predominance of self-realization, knowledge of self-awareness, which is why it is called Samarthya Yoga. "Revealed experience, taste of the essence." "The experience of the past, the garden of joy, the treasure of joy." - Shri Devchandraji

This Samarthya Yoga is "associated with, combined with, Pratijnaan, and it becomes the means, the cause, of omniscience, etc. It is as follows: Pratijnaan is the knowledge that arises from Pratibha, knowledge that is endowed with Pratibha. Pratibha is extraordinary light, brilliance, radiance. In which the extraordinary experience of the soul shines, radiates, glows, that is Pratijnaan. In which the power of consciousness is extraordinarily intense, Pratijnaan, wonder, unique experience, light, brilliance, is revealed, is experienced, is called "Pratijnaan". Such Pratijnaan is present in Samarthya Yoga. It is also called "Uha" (unique philosophical contemplation) according to the path, because according to the path, it is the unique philosophical contemplation of the "Drshtanta" who is walking on the path of liberation, following the pure path. For example - the inert becomes conscious, the nature of matter is different, both are understood clearly; the form of consciousness is itself inert, it is only a relationship, or it is also in matter; that experience is illuminated, the inert becomes detached, it becomes self-awareness; the body is forgotten, Maya is pacified in the form of Maya, for the Nigrantha, this is the path, the end of existence, the remedy." - Shrimad Rajchandraji 

Page #100:
---------------------------
(3) **Gadashtīsamuccaya** - This **pratibhajñāna**-like, great, luminous lamp (Search-Light) illuminates the path ahead, making it self-luminous and radiant. Thus, with the strength of **yogi**, the path becomes visible and the **yogi** progresses forward, ascending the **kṛpaśreṇī** and gradually destroying the **karma** nature. “Thus, by conquering the **chāritrameha**, reaching that state where the **karaṇa** is devoid of previous **bhāva**, ascending the **śreṇī** with the **kṣepaka** of **āruḍhatā**, with unique contemplation and extremely pure nature... an unprecedented opportunity. The **meha** swims like a self-born ocean, reaching a state where the **guṇasthāna** is diminished, at that time, becoming completely **vītarāga**, revealing the treasure of **kevalajñāna**... an unprecedented opportunity.” – **Śrīmad Rājacandrajī**. Further, this **sāmavega** is the means and cause of **sarvajñapana**-**siddhapada**, etc. Because, through it, without any will, the attainment of **sarvajñāna**-**kevalajñāna**, etc., occurs. This **yogi**, endowed with **prātibhājñāna**, ascends the **kṣepakaśreṇī** and at the end of the **śreṇī**, attains **kevalajñāna**. With the rise of the **kevalajñāna** sun, the **yogi** becomes **sarvajña**-**sarvadashī**. And then, when the lifespan of this last body is complete, the **yogi** becomes **ayogi kevalī-siddha**, the physical form is destroyed.” The four **karma** are completely destroyed, the seeds of **bhavana** are completely destroyed, the **sarvabhāva** knower becomes completely pure, the **kṛtakṛtya** **prabhu** has infinite light... an unprecedented opportunity. The four **karma** of **vedanā**, etc., are destroyed, leaving only the form like a burnt cinder; the state of the body is dependent on the lifespan, when the lifespan is complete, the physical form is destroyed... unprecedented.” – **Śrīmad Rājacandrajī**. And perhaps one may doubt, from where does this sixth knowledge, **prātibhājñāna**, come? It does not diminish, because knowledge is only of five types. And this **prātibhājñāna** is not **kevalajñāna**, because **kevalajñāna** is like the result of the work of **sāmagāna**, it is the form-fruit, the result, because the work and the result are not one. Therefore, this **prātibhājñāna** is **śruta-jñāna**.

## Translation:

**Samarthyoga (35)**

Its resolution is this: This pratibha-jnana is not shruta-jnana, nor is it kevala-jnana, nor is it any other knowledge. Just as the dawn is distinct from night and day, yet it is not one of the two; similarly, this pratibha-jnana is the knowledge of the junction between shruta and kevala, it is distinct from both, yet it is not one of the two. (1) It cannot be called shruta-jnana, because it has such an excellent pratibha-sampanna lopa-shma, that it cannot be dealt with as shruta-jnana. (2) Nor can it be called kevala-jnana, because pratibha-jnana is lapa-shmik-upa-shma bhavarupa, and kevala-jnana is kshayik bhavarupa. And in pratibha-jnana, all dravya-paryaya cannot be known, while in kevala they can be known. Thus, there is a clear distinction between the two. 

"Chenaiznitah sa tu katimëjnit: Ladya vinatrikhya vghu thai chhe" - Shri Adhyatma Upanishad and other darshanas also agree with this "pratibha-jnana". They call it "tarak-nirikshan" etc. Tarak means the one that saves from the ocean of births. Nirīkṣaṇa means the direct vision of the dṛṣṭa puruṣa. Thus, there is no fault in believing this pratibha-jnana, that is, it is true and right.

To explain the difference in samarthyoga, it is said:

"Dvidhayam dharmasannnyasayogasannnyasasangnitaha / Kshayopa-shamika dharmaha, yogah kayadi karma tu // 9 //"

This samarthyoga has two types: first, dharma-sannnyasa, and second, yoga-sannnyasa. Those dharmas which are kshapa-shmik are called dharma-sannnyasa; karma like kaya etc. is called yoga-sannnyasa. 9

**Vritti:**

These two types are called samarthyoga. How? Because the name "dharma-sannnyasa" arises from the combination of dharma-sannnyasa and sannnyasa. Similarly, the name "yoga-sannnyasa" arises from the combination of yoga and sannnyasa. And here, it is recognized in such a way that it is clearly identified, therefore it is considered as such. What are these dharmas? It is said that they are kshapa-shmik dharmas. These are dharmas like kshama etc. which arise from kshaya and upashma. And yoga is the activity of kaya etc. - karma like sarvakaran etc.

(3) **Gadashtīsamuccaya** meaning - There are two types of this Samag-Dharma-Sannyasa and Yoga-Sannyasa, named as such. Those which are Kshapashmik (arising from Kshayopaśama भाव) are Dharmas, and the karma of Kaya etc. is "Ga". There are two divisions of this Samag - (1) Dharma-Sannyasa, named as such, (2) "Gasbhyasa", named as such. Here, Dharmas are Kshayopaśama भावs, and Go is the karma-vyāpār of man-vacan-kāya, kāyothsarga-karaṇa etc. Here, the word "Sanjna" is used intentionally, because that by which something becomes known in its form - is known correctly, is recognized properly - that is Sanjna. Dharma-Sannyasa-yoga - in which there is Sannyasa, i.e. renunciation of Dharmas, is Dharma-Sannyasa. Here, "Dharmas" are to be understood as all types of Kshapashmik भावs - भावs arising from Kshapashma. The भावs which arise from Kshayopaśama भाव, like Kshama etc., are those Dharmas. Here, there is Sannyasa - renunciation of these Kshayopaśama-rupa Dharmas, because these Mahatmas, being Samarthya-yogi, are established on Kshapanī, and as they consume - consume - destroy - destroy the karmas, they progress, hence they produce Kshavik भावs arising from karma-kshaya, Kshavik Samyaktva-darshan-jnana-charitra etc. qualities manifest. Thus, as Kshavik भावs arise, Kshayopaśama भावs are abandoned. "Kshavik Darshan Jnana, Charan Guna Upannya Re; Adik Bahu Guna Sasy, Atamghar Nipjya Re....Shri Nami Jinavar Sev, Ghanaghan Unmyo Chhe." - Shri Devchandraji Gasannyasa Yoga - Gasannyasa is that in which there is Sannyasa - renunciation of Yogas, i.e. of the karmas of man-vacan-kāya. Where there is absence of the Yogas of man-vacan-kāya, where that Agi अवस्था is, that is Yugasannyasa. "Man Vachan Kaya Ne Kamni Vagan, Chute Jahan Sakal Pudgal Sambandh Chhe; Evu "Agi" Gunasthanak Tyahan Vartatu, Mahabhagya Sukhdayak Purna Bandh Je...Apurva." - Shrimad Rajchandraji Thus, these two names are given, which is true. When that is there, then it is said, thus, to show that these Samarthya-yogas are of two types:

## Dharma Sannyasa Yoga (37)

**Verse 10:** In the second pre-action, the first is tattvika; after the initiation, the second, so say the knowers.

**Explanation:** In the second pre-action, the first Dharma Sannyasa Yoga is tattvika; and after the initiation, the second Dharma Sannyasa Yoga is present, so say the knowers. In the second pre-action, the second is accepted as an exception to the first pre-action, which is the cause of the bondage, because the first pre-action lacks the ability to achieve the goal. "Pre-action" is that auspicious pre-result which is not present in the beings of the infinite cycle of births and deaths, even in the Dharma-sthana, and whose fruit is the bondage, etc. In this first pre-action, the bondage is present, and the fruit of this bondage is right faith. And right faith is the first self-realization with the initial sign of the linga. It is said: "**"Atha pramanjanikana pustiyam, vyarthila tarvayeshradhanam sabhyapuranam!"** - Right faith, whose object is the manifestation of calmness, enthusiasm, detachment, compassion, and faith, is right faith. According to the order of importance, this explanation is arranged, and it is beautiful in reverse order, so say the scriptures. And this second pre-action, which is present in the state of karma, which is like the ocean of countless births, what is it? It is tattvika in the second pre-action. The first is tattvika, which is known as Dharma Sannyasa Yoga, which is transcendental. And it is present in the yogi who has the series of destructions, because he has renounced the Dharma like forgiveness, etc., which are destructive. (The Dharma like forgiveness, etc., have been destroyed in the form of destruction.) Therefore, this is the explanation. The Dharma Sannyasa Yoga, which is tattvika, is also present during the time of initiation, because there is renunciation of the Dharma, which is characterized by activity, and this initiation is the acceptance of the knowledge yoga. Therefore, this initiation is said to be the right of the one who is detached from the world. It is said: "**"Atha pravrajjyaai aaryadeshotpanna, vishistajatikulanvita, kshina prayakarmamala, ata eva vimala buddhi"** -

---------------------------
(38) The text divides the ability to contemplate the collection of yogic practices into two sections: Dharma-Sannyasa (renunciation of worldly duties) and Sannyasa (renunciation of all attachments). Here, we will explain when each occurs: (1) The first type, Dharma-Sannyasa, is characterized by a detachment from worldly desires and occurs during the second stage of the spiritual journey (Dvitiya Apurvakarana). (2) The second type, Sannyasa, is characterized by a complete detachment from all attachments and occurs after the stage of Ayojyakarana (the stage of self-control and purification). 

The text then quotes a passage from the scriptures: "Rare is the human birth, birth and death are inevitable, wealth is fleeting, worldly pleasures are the cause of suffering, union is followed by separation, death is imminent, and the consequences of karma are severe." This understanding of the impermanence and suffering of the world leads to detachment from it. This detachment is further characterized by the following qualities: 

* **Pratanukashaya:**  A gradual reduction of karmic tendencies.
* **Alpahasya:**  A decrease in laughter and amusement.
* **Kritagnya:**  Gratitude.
* **Vinit:**  Humility.
* **Kari:**  Diligence.
* **Jnanyajnanavaddhuta:**  One who is devoted to the knowledge of the self.
* **Gova:**  One who is free from attachment to possessions.
* **Vala:**  One who is free from attachment to the body.
* **Shraddha:**  Faith.
* **Samupana:**  One who is devoted to the practice of meditation.

The text then explains that this type of person is the one who is capable of practicing Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge). It is impossible for someone who does not possess these qualities to practice Jnana Yoga, and it is equally impossible for someone who does possess these qualities to not practice Jnana Yoga. This is the clear message of the scriptures. 

The text then explains the meaning of Ayojyakarana: It is the stage where, through the power of Kevala Jnana (omniscience), one is able to completely destroy the karmic tendencies that bind them to the cycle of birth and death. This is achieved through a complete detachment from all attachments and a complete surrender to the divine. The result of this stage is the attainment of the state of Shashi (a state of complete liberation). 

The text then explains the meaning of Sannyasa: It is the state of complete detachment from all attachments, which is achieved after the stage of Ayojyakarana. This state is characterized by a complete absence of any desire or attachment to the world. This is the true meaning of Sannyasa, as explained by the scriptures. 

The text then quotes a passage from the scriptures that further explains the meaning of Sannyasa: "The first stage of the spiritual journey is characterized by the destruction of the karmic tendencies that bind us to the cycle of birth and death. The second stage is characterized by the complete destruction of all karmic tendencies. The third stage is characterized by the complete liberation of the soul from the cycle of birth and death. This is the true meaning of Sannyasa." 

The text concludes by stating that this is the true meaning of Sannyasa, as explained by the scriptures.

## Dharma-Sannyasa Yoga (39) - Tatvik Dharma-Sannyasa Yoga

This yoga, first, involves Dharma-Sannyasa, and that too of the Tatvik-Paramarthik kind. Second, it manifests at the time of the second A-poorvakarana. Here, what is said about the second A-poorvakarana is purposeful. Because the first A-poorvakarana, which is the cause of Granthi-bhed, cannot be this presented Dharma-Sannyasa, therefore, it is mentioned as an exception in the second A-poorvakarana. These A-poorvakaranas are two: (1) the cause of Granthi-bhed, (2) the time of the Kshapaka-shreni. What is this A-poorvakarana? "A-poorva" means the auspicious and excellent Atma-parinam which has never been attained before in the endless cycle of births and deaths. Granthi-bhed etc. are the fruits of this A-poorvakarana. The fruit of the first A-poorvakarana is Granthi-bhed, and the fruit of that Granthi-bhed is Samyag-darshan.

Granthi-bhed - Granthi means knot. Like the hard knot of a bamboo, which is difficult to break, so too is the dense knot of Karma, which is the result of Raga-dvesha, where it breaks, that is called Granthi-bhed. "And when this powerful mountain of Karma-granthi is broken by the sharp weapon of A-poorvakarana-rupa Bhava-vajra, then this great soul experiences immense Tatvik joy - just as a sick person experiences joy when their illness is controlled by excellent medicine. And this breaking of the Granthi is such that it does not happen again in the same way. Once it breaks, that's it! It will never rise again in that form, it will never be tied again, that is called bhed, because after such Granthi-bhed, there is no rise of intense Kshaya etc. "This Granthi-bhed always leads to the goal of Nirvana. Just as a blind man, when he gets the auspicious merit of sight, experiences the benefit of sight (he sees clearly), so too, when this Granthi is broken, he experiences Samyag-darshan - he sees the true nature of things."

* " तथा च भिन्ने दुर्भेदे कर्मग्रन्थिमहाबले । तीक्ष्णेन भाववज्रेग बहुसंक्लेशकारिणि ॥ आनन्दो जायतेऽत्यन्तं तात्त्विकोऽस्य महात्मनः । सद्वथाध्यभिभवे यद्वद् व्याधितस्य महौषधात् ॥ भेदोऽपि चास्य विज्ञेयो न भूयो भवनं तथा । तीव्रसंक्लेशविगमात्सदा निःश्रेयसावहः ॥ जात्यन्धस्य यथा पुसश्चक्षुर्लाभे शुभोदये । सद्दर्शनं तथैवास्य ग्रथिभेदेऽपरे जगुः "
– Maharshi Haribhadracharya's Gabindu 

Page #106:
---------------------------
(40)
The collection of right views (Samyag Darshan) arises as the fruit and result of the separation of the knot (Granthi Bhed). Faith in the meaning (Tarth) is Samyag Darshan. The knowledge of the nine principles - Jiva, Ajeeva, Pushya, Pap, Aav, Sanvar, Nirjara, Bandh, and Moksha - and their true nature is Samyag Darshan. "In the garland of many beads representing these nine principles, there is a golden thread of the soul (Atma Tattva) hidden for a long time. The person with right views (Samyag Drishti Purush) discovers and experiences this pure soul." Jiva and Ajeeva are bound by karma, the cause of which is punya and papa. The cause of the arrival of punya and papa is asrava. Asrava leads to bondage. Sanvar can stop the arrival of new karma, and Nirjara can remove old karma. By continuously practicing Nirjara, all karma is destroyed, leading to Moksha, the state of pure soul consciousness. Only the pure soul attains Moksha. This understanding of the principles is what arises in the person with right views. Thus, the knowledge and experience of the pure soul, distinct from the body and other external objects, as eternal and indestructible, is Samyag Darshan. Its other name is Samkiti. 

"There is nothing in the three realms, in the three times, that is equal to right views (Samyaktva) in terms of benefit, and nothing is equal to wrong views (Mithyatva) in terms of harm." - Shri Samantabhadracharya

"Like gold submerged in a garland of pearls, the nine principles are hidden. But when they are seen clearly, they appear as one." - Shri Amritchandracharya, Samyatsar Kalash

## Dharma-Sannyasa Yoga

(41) And thus, with the breaking of the knots (granthi-bhed) and the attainment of Samyak Darshan, the realization of the soul, which brings supreme bliss, the following spontaneous expressions of the Samyak Darshi Yogi arise:

“It is certain that the soul has attained knowledge; the breaking of the knots is a truth in all three times. All knowers have also accepted this.”

“Salutations to the auspicious Samyak Darshan, which transformed the knowledge that was destined for endless cycles of birth and death into a single moment, making it the cessation of birth and death.”

- Shrimad Rajchandraji says that this auspicious Samyak Darshan is attained after the breaking of the knots through the unique (apuurvakaran) means. And this Samyak Darshan has five signs (ling), which are its manifest characteristics: (1) Prasham (tranquility), (2) Sanveg (zeal), (3) Nirved (dispassion), (4) Anukampa (compassion), (5) Astikya (faith).

According to their primary importance, these characteristics of Samyaktava have this sequential order, but according to their reverse order, they are beautiful and radiant, say those who know the secrets of the scriptures. Because,

If there is no Astikya, then Prasham, etc., will not appear beautiful or good, they will not be attractive, etc. This should be understood in reverse order. And it should be understood that the first characteristic leads to the next characteristic in reverse order. It is like this:

First, there is Prasham, the cessation of passions, which gives space for the thought of discrimination (viveka), then Sanveg, the desire for liberation alone, arises, from which Nirved, the weariness of the world, arises, and Anukampa, compassion for oneself and others, arises. When these four qualities manifest in the soul, the capacity and eligibility to attain the fifth quality, Astikya, is revealed. (This is the reverse order.)

Cessation of passions, desire for liberation alone; sorrow for birth, compassion for beings, dwelling in the self, such a state is not there until, the soul does not get the right path; it does not attain the path of liberation, the disease of the heart does not subside.”

- Shrimad Rajchandraji’s Shri Atmasiddhi

Or, in reverse order, Astikya, the faith in the existence of the soul, the principle of life, etc., arises, the true nature is known, then Anukampa arises, knowing this soul, etc., a tremor arises in the soul, which is compassion for oneself, compassion for the soul of the father, arises, that - Oh! 

Page #108:
---------------------------
(42)
I have been playing in the world of objects, due to the contact with objects, until now! I did not go to play. Such a feeling of sorrow and trembling arises in the soul, that is compassion. For example -
"I left my own form and played on the bridge,
I turned back and wandered in the water of the object of desire" - Shri Devchandraji Such true compassion arises, then there is extreme disgust with the world of objects. In this world, which is like a cage of charcoal, I do not want to stay even for a moment with the feeling of the soul, so he gets up from the world. And from that disgust, which arises from detachment, the emotion, that is, the intense desire for liberation, arises, when will I be free from this worldly bondage, such a pure feeling arises, he becomes a firm seeker of liberation, and as a result, calmness manifests, the calmness of the object-passions, detachment from the other, non-attachment comes and he merges in the self-nature.
Such a five-characteristic right faith is obtained by the living being first due to the power of the previous karma. And then, after crossing countless oceans like the number of karmas, this second
Previous karma - the previous self-result is obtained, then this is the essential dharma. It is for the capable one who is climbing the series of renunciation in the dharma-renunciation. Renunciation because he is free from the dharmas of forgiveness, etc., which are in the form of renunciation, and
It tends towards the destructive feeling of destroying all the karma-natures like anger, etc., from the root. And such a "dharma-renunciation" is called, it is truly the essential, transcendental "dharma-renunciation".
"Essential dharma-renunciation" also occurs at the time of the initiation of the ascetic, because in which there is renunciation of the dharmas in the form of activity, it is called the initiation of renunciation. Sin
To go from there to the pure feet, that is "initiation". The shaving of the evil feelings like the object-passions, etc., is called "initiation". Dharma-renunciation (initiation-renunciation) is the acceptance of the knowledge-yoga, therefore
Only the one who is truly disgusted with the world from the inner result, who has become extremely detached in the mind, is said to be the eligible candidate for such initiation, which is the attainment of knowledge. To go to initiation, to go to accept the monk's dharma, what kind of special characteristics should the living being have, it is said here -
(1) who was born in the Aryan country, (2) who has a special caste-family, (3) whose karma is almost exhausted, (4) therefore, who is pure

Those who are wise, (5) · human existence is rare, birth and death are the cause, the desire for wealth is fickle, objects are the cause of suffering, attachment leads to separation, death is imminent, the consequences of karma are terrible - whoever has known the futility, the negativity, the worthlessness, the triviality of the world, (6) therefore, he who has become detached from the world, (7) whose passions have become extremely subtle, thin, weak - who is free from passions, (8) in whom laughter, attraction, aversion, etc. are minimal, (9) who is grateful, who knows the favors

whose weight was felt even in society, who was prestigious and honorable, (12) who is not a traitor, who does not betray gods, gurus, religion, kings, country, society, etc., (13) who is blessed with

The **Yoga-darsti-samuccaya** is completely destroyed, making it extremely **a-upapanna**. Thus, due to the **prakrushta-pana** of **vishuddhi**, this **sthiti-ghat-rasa-ghat** is **aparva** compared to the previous two **guna-sthana**. (3) Also, here, due to the immense power of **vishuddhi**, the creation of the **guna-shreni** is **aparva**, as if the **kama-dali** are arranged to be thrown away quickly. (4) And the **shubha-prakruti** that is bound, taking away the **ashubha-dali** with countless **guna-vridhi** in anticipation, this **guna-sankrama** is also **aparva** here. (5) And the **karma** that used to bind for a long time due to **ashuddha-pana** before the **sthiti**, here, due to **aparva-karana** and extreme **vishuddha-pana**, it binds for a very short time. Thus, these five things are **aparva** here, therefore the name "**aparva-karana**" is meaningful.

The **yogi-purusha** who attains this **aparva** **atma-samarthy** in the form of **aparva-karana**, and who ascends the **kshapka-shreni**, has this **tattivak dharma-sanyasa-yoga**, because he progresses while destroying the **kshapka-shreni** in the form of **dharmas**, completely destroying the **karma-prakruti**, while destroying the **kshapka-shreni**, while throwing it away, he ascends the **guna-sthana-shreni**. And thus, while destroying the **karma-shatru**, this supremely powerful **vira-purusha** surpasses the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th **guna-sthana**, and reaches the 13th **sagi-kevali-guna-sthana**, manifesting his own **kevala-jnana-nidhana**.

– **Basanyasa-yoga** – And the other **samarthy-yoga** called "**Bagasanyasa**" is after **ajyaka-karana**. It is like this –

Due to **achintya-virya-pana**, with extraordinary **atma-samarthy**, the **kevali-bhagavan** performs **samud-ghat**, before which he performs **ajyaka-karana**. What is **ajyaka-karana**? The **gavyapara** that is done now, this **ajyaka-karana**, this limit – the limit seen by the **kevali**, according to the **ajyaka-karana** measure, **jan=javu** it, the **shubha-yoga**'s **vyaparan-pravartan**; **karana=parinam** special, **samarthy-vishesh**. According to the limit seen by the **kevali-bhagavan**, to project the **bhava-upagrahi-kama** in the **udirana-avali** is **ajyaka-karana**. That is, in the last **bhava**, the remaining **vedaniya** etc. four **karmas** to be experienced, in which the **sthiti** of **vedaniya** etc. is more than the **ayushya**, the **kevali-bhagavan** performs **udirana**, **jyaka-karana**, so that with **samud-ghat**, he can quickly destroy those **karmas** and bring them to an equal **sthiti**.

##  Samudghāt

(45) By organizing in this way, the Kevali Bhagwan performs Samudghāt. Not all Kevali Bhagwan perform Samudghāt, but those whose Vedaniya, etc. karmas have a lifespan longer than the Kevali lifespan, they perform Samudghāt to equalize those karmas. This is done so that those karmas can be quickly mixed and disposed of immediately. Leaving the original body behind, the exit of the Jiva-pinda, the Atma-pradesh-samuh, from the body is called Samudghāt. Samudghāt means Sam - Ughāt, Sam means Samyak, i.e. Apunarbhav, not again, Ut = Prabhalya, with strength, Ghāt means destruction, annihilation, decay of karma. The strong effort in which karma is destroyed, annihilated, in a way that it does not arise again, is Samudghāt. In this Kevali-Samudghāt, the Atma-pradesh expands, taking on a Virat form, and with that Atma-pradesh, the entire lake is filled in the form of Dand-Kapāt-Pratar, and that karma-pradesh is touched, quickly experienced, and destroyed. Then, that Atma-pradesh is concluded in reverse order. This entire process is completed in just eight moments! This supremely wonderful, inconceivable power is expressed by this supreme Samarthayagi!!

And the result of this organization and Samudghāt is Sheleshikaran, meaning that Sheleshikaran is attained immediately after. In it, the speed of mind, speech, and body is completely suppressed, and this supremely powerful Yagi, meditating on the fourth Shukla-dhyana, attains the state of Sheleshikaran, like the Shelesh-Meru-Parvat, a state of unshakeable stillness. Or, the Shelesh, which is the form of complete Samadhi, becomes Ish. Thus, this state of Shelesh-Meru, like a still, Meg-nirodh, of this secret, supreme Yagi, is Sheleshikaran; or, the state of this Shelesh-Yagishwar, who has attained supreme Samadhi, is Sheleshikaran. This Shelesh state lasts as long as the five short vowels (a, i, u, l) are pronounced, and immediately after the last moment, this supreme Yagi ascends to Siddha-pada.

With the collection of Gadasti, the power of destruction is swift and agile, the consciousness is purified and made pure;
The feeling of attachment has become completely inactive, destroying the four bodies and their remnants.” Shri Devchandraji “The count of mind, speech, body and karma, where all the material connections are released;
Such an unयोगी state of being exists there, a great fortune, a blissful, complete bondage, which is unprecedented, only a single atom, not touched, completely free from blemishes, unwavering, like the sun, pure, unstained, conscious awareness, unique, without beginning or end, subtle, natural, in the form of a state...unprecedented
-Shrimad Rajchandraji Thus, this state of complete renunciation is attained in the state of Shilesh.
– As per the practice of the karmas – The Bhavyas attain all three karmas, namely, Yathapravrittakaran, Apoovarakaran and Anivrittikaran, and the others, that is, the Abhavya, only have the first karma, Yathapravrittakaran, the other karmas can never be attained by them. Here, karma means result. (Verse 1).
Just as a stone from a mountain and a river, when rubbed, ground, pounded, beaten, by the law of friction and pulverization, becomes round and smooth, so too, the wandering, wandering soul in the endless cycle of existence, sometimes, somehow,
As the feeling of attachment diminishes and the Bhavyata matures, some special Yathapravrittakaran, self-result, occurs, some state of karma arises, which produces a dullness in the taste,
Or it comes close to the knot. “As it has been coming, in this way, in the endless flow of time, the soul, which is constantly moving, sometimes, a little bit, a feeling of excitement, which is common (Ordinarily), that is the Yathapravrittakaran. Such Yathapravrittakaran, it makes the soul and the body, and it comes close to the infinite knot. But it is only a general, ordinary effort, and due to the weakness of the self-power, it returns without breaking the knot. This karma is attained by both the Bhavyas and the Abhavya, but the other two karmas are attained only by the Bhavyas, not by the Abhavya, that is why they cannot enter the path of liberation.
And the Bhavyas also, until they attain the unprecedented (Unprecedented) self-resultant feeling, perform unprecedented self-effort, with unique effort, with extraordinary (Extraordinary effort)
effort, with all their might (With all his might), bravely, with unprecedented effort, “Yahoom” to do, to break the impenetrable fortress of the knot, with all their soul,
until then, they too do not succeed in that task. Because for the difficult task of breaking the knot, an unusual, extraordinary effort is needed. In it, the previous Yathapravritta, like 

Page #113:
---------------------------
As per the existing karma, etc.
(47) That effort will not work. Just as in a war, to conquer a strong fort, a strong weapon must be used to make a heavy attack (Mass attack), so to conquer the knot-like impenetrable fortress, an unprecedented self-effort-like feeling-weight must be used to make a strong attack. Otherwise, there will be failure in it, that is, one has to "retreat" from the knot.
The knot is in the first gunasthana, its penetration and moving forward to the fourth, the worldly one, has not been reached. Some beings, by destroying their karma, come with a high feeling, thinking of getting out of the first, come close to the knot-breaking. There, the knot's strength becomes so much on him that he becomes slack in breaking the knot, stops and returns accordingly. In this way, the being has come close to the knot-breaking and has returned. Some beings, by strong self-effort, awaken the causal factors, make a strong effort, break the knot, and move forward, and when they break the knot and move forward, they come to the fourth, and when they come to the fourth, they will be liberated sooner or later, such an impression is received by that being.
-Shrimad Rajchandra also, when the being is in the last pudgala, and even in that, the feeling-mal becomes extremely thin, then the glorious being gets the last yathapravrittakaran, and
he comes very close to the knot-breaking. Then, with the unprecedented self-effort feeling becoming excited, with the unprecedented self-effort's enthusiasm, the unprecedented karman gets the anivrittikaran, anivrittikaran's attainment, unprecedented karman. So, in the beginningless time,
never attained before, that unprecedented self-result and samyaktv's attainment will not be left behind - will not be reversed, that anivrittikaran, from the unprecedented karman, the knot-breaking happens, and from the anivrittikaran, samyaktv happens.
In it, as long as there is a knot, as long as there is yathapravrittakaran, there is unprecedented karman in breaking - violating the knot, and when the being breaks the knot and faces samyaktv, there is anivrittikaran. (Verse-2). This knot is extremely impenetrable - a very hard knot to break. Like a knot of bamboo, which is harsh, dense, rigid and deep, is difficult to break, so the being's deep knot of attachment-aversion result is very difficult. (Verse-3). Therefore, to break it, the being must make unprecedented self-effort. All this will be understood from the figure -

After the collection of yogadristi and thus this knot is broken, this jiva abandons the deep results of raga-dvesha, its raga etc. become weak, the evil anantanubandhi kshaya quartet, time-fruit etc. are destroyed, dasanamaha becomes and samyagdarshan manifests. Because even a little bit of pure samyagjnan is the goal of true asammoha. (Gatha-4).
After attaining samyaktva, the state from two to nine palyopam in paprthphv, that is, in charitramehaniya karma, is destroyed, true bhavasravakapan is attained; and when the state of sankhyata sagaropam is destroyed from that charitrameha, true bhavasadhuapan and upshamshreni-kshapkshreni are attained respectively. (Gatha-5). Etc. is said here briefly. The special inquisitive should refer to places like karmagranth etc.

It is worth noting here that after attaining samyaktva, the jiva, with intense speed, continues and increases the a-purva purushartha stream, the more it destroys the above mentioned palyopam-sagaropama etc. states quickly, it attains the bhavasravak, bhavasadhu etc. states in a flash, and ascends the upsham-kshapkshreni, manifests unparalleled kevaljnan, until it attains moksha in that very bhava. The jiva who is slow in purushartha, will also be slow in attaining moksha accordingly. Therefore, attaining moksha is dependent on the jiva's purushartha strength. The sooner the purushartha is done, the sooner moksha is attained, therefore, the jiva should abandon the false bhava-sthiiti etc. and remain constantly engaged in true purushartha, as is understood from the teachings of the wise.
Because there is another yoga (g-sanyas) in the next (urva-forward) from anyakaran, therefore

## A Yoga of Non-Yoga

(49) Therefore, the non-yoga among yogas is described as the supreme yoga. It is characterized by the complete renunciation of all, with the intention of attaining liberation. || 11 ||

Therefore, that which is "non-yoga" is called the supreme yoga among yogas. (Because) it connects with liberation and is characterized by complete renunciation.

- As explained earlier, this non-yoga is the state of complete renunciation. It is devoid of the activity of mind, speech, and body, and it is the absence of all restrictive yogas. Therefore, it is called "non-yoga." And this "non-yoga" is the supreme yoga, the supreme among all yogas, because it is the primary means to liberation. It is truly "yoga" because it directly connects with liberation. And it is characterized by complete renunciation, which is the highest purity.

Calling this "non-yoga" the supreme yoga is indeed appropriate, because it directly connects with liberation, which is the sole ultimate goal of all yogas. The word "yoga" itself means "connection," and this non-yoga connects with liberation. Similarly, here there is complete renunciation, which is a higher purity than renunciation of unrighteousness or righteousness. And now there is nothing left to renounce, so this non-yoga is the supreme yoga.

Here, even the slightest touch of an atom does not remain. The pure self-nature, completely free from impurities, manifests. The unique, pure, and unblemished consciousness shines forth. The subtle, formless, innate self-nature is attained. This innate self-nature is the state of complete renunciation, because of the absence of all yogas (the absence of the yoga of mind, speech, and body). Among the yogas like friendship, etc., what is the supreme yoga? It is the non-yoga, the primary one, as stated. How? It is said that it connects with liberation, with the intention of attaining liberation.

It is said that yoga is due to connection. Its nature is described as complete renunciation, because it is a higher purity than even the renunciation of unrighteousness and righteousness.

The state of Yoga-drishti-samuccaya has been seen by Shri Sarvagna Deva in his knowledge, but even Shri Bhagwan cannot describe its form. How can other speech describe that form? That knowledge is only experienced by the knower.
“The state that Shri Sarvagna saw in his knowledge, even Shri Bhagwan could not describe it; what can other speech say about that form? That knowledge remains only experienced…unprecedented.”
–Thus, the journey of Shrimad Rajchandraji towards the desired destination of liberation, which he started with Iccha, ends here. Moving forward continuously, sometimes slowly and sometimes at a rapid pace, he traversed all the stages, starting from Shubhechchha and ending with Shaileshikaran, and finally arrived at the magnificent gate of the city of liberation, which is like a purification. And then, he immediately entered the city.

## Summary

Thus, here we have described the form of the three yogas: *Icchayoga*, *Shaastrayoga*, and *Samarthayoga*. To understand this *Sarasamuccaya* (summary), let's use a school-like analogy:

Imagine a traveler lost in a terrifying forest, surrounded by dangers on all sides. How intensely would he desire a way out? Or, imagine a patient suffering from a severe illness, how desperately would he wish for a skilled physician to restore his health? Or, imagine someone parched in a barren land during scorching summer, how much would they crave water?

Similarly, a soul, like a traveler lost in the terrifying forest of this world, first desires to escape it. He wants to attain *Moksha* (liberation) and reach the desired destination of *Moksha*. Therefore, he seeks guidance from a *Sadguru* (spiritual guide), who knows the path. He listens to the information provided by the *Sadguru* and learns that this is the path leading in a certain direction. Knowing this, he feels relieved and becomes knowledgeable. Then, he tries to walk on this designated path with faith. However, due to the difficulties of the path and his lack of experience, he sometimes makes mistakes. As a result, his journey may sometimes stop or slow down, and sometimes it may speed up. Thus, this *Icchayogi* (aspirant) continues to move forward.

During this journey, the *Shaastra* (scriptures) are like guides, always accompanying him. By following their instructions, he gains complete and unadulterated knowledge of the *Shaastra*. With their help, he moves forward with faith, seeing the path clearly. He progresses steadily, according to his own strength and the speed allowed by the *Shaastra*.

As he continues his journey, he crosses the terrifying forest and reaches a beautiful highway, a straight path. From there, the *Shaastra* guides tell him, "Oh, great soul, *Shaastrayogi*! Look, this path leads directly to *Moksha*. Walk straight towards it! This is the general instruction I give you. Follow it. As you move forward, you will understand more details on your own. Therefore, there is no need for me to guide you further. You are now capable." Thus ends the story. 

Page #118:
---------------------------
(p)
The yogi, with a grateful heart, says: "Oh, most benevolent one, with the scriptures as your weapon! How can I express my gratitude to you? You have bestowed upon me an unimaginable favor. I have reached this point because of your grace, and I am indebted to you for the valuable guidance you have provided. I will always be ready to follow your commands. I am confident that with your blessings, I will soon reach my desired destination, Mekshanagar. You have taken great pains for me, and I have also strived to the best of my ability to fulfill your instructions. If any transgression has occurred, please forgive me. Farewell, salutations!"

Then, the powerful yogi, with self-power, sets off on the path of liberation with intense fervor, moving with great speed. With the vision of intuitive knowledge, the path ahead appears clear to him like a bright lamp. As he progresses towards his desired goal with strength, his enthusiasm grows. He sheds the shackles of worldly desires, lightening his burden, and thus moves forward with increasing speed. With unprecedented self-power, he ascends the ladder of liberation, renouncing the world, and swiftly crosses the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th stages of liberation. He reaches the 13th stage, attains omniscience, and directly perceives all substances and their transformations. There, he sees Mekshanagar directly. It is as if he has reached his ultimate destination.

There, he rests for a while (according to his lifespan), and shares the knowledge he has gained with others, benefiting the world and performing the highest act of compassion.

Then, as his lifespan comes to an end, he renounces the attachments of mind, speech, and body. Thus, he performs yogic renunciation, enters the state of liberation through the magnificent door, like the peak of Mount Meru, and enters Mekshanagar. He becomes a liberated soul and dwells eternally in infinite bliss, in an endless state of meditation.

"With the momentum of the previous causes, he ascends to the state of liberation, the abode of the liberated souls, and dwells eternally in infinite bliss, with infinite vision, knowledge, and...unprecedented..."

- Shrimad Rajchandraji

## The Kalasha Kavya of Yogadristi
(53)
**Yogadristi Kalasha Kavya**
Mandakranta

One who gains vision and knowledge through the hearing of the dead,
With faith, they walk and attain liberation; and with strength, supreme talent, dharma, and renunciation,
Leaving behind the mind, speech, and body, they reach the perfect abode. 1.

The one who is devoted to the desire and the knower, they are both playful,
The one who is devoted to the scriptures, they are very virtuous and not playful,
With the strength of experience, they practice dharma and renunciation,
In the abode of the Lord, they attain liberation. 2.

Those who desire and inquire, they are awakened,
They are pure in mind and soul, they attain the path and are delighted. 3.

The one who is adorned with desire and faith, they are adorned with the essence of the scriptures;
They attain Srimad Haribhadra, they attain the supreme, the unattached. 4.

The Lord of pure consciousness, the natural form;
He attains the glory of the Lord, the supreme bliss. 5.

A General Statement of the Eight Yoga-Dṛṣṭis

The three Yogas, namely Iccha, Śāstra, and Sāmarthya, which were clearly described above, are not directly relied upon, but rather, the Ghaṭa-Dṛṣṭis, which are specifically produced from those three Yogas, are being stated here, and they are eight in general. These eight Yoga-Dṛṣṭis are included within those three Yogas. These Ghaṭa-Dṛṣṭi rivers have originated from the Yoga-mountain, so they have a close relationship with it, and that is why the

## A General Statement on the Eight Yogadrishtis

(55) **Foundation:** To understand the concept of "Pīḍik" properly, it was essential to first describe the eight Yogas, including "Īcchā" and others. This is evident from the above discussion.

And these are:

**"Mitrā, Tārā, Balā, Dīprā, Sthirā, Kāntā, Prabhā, and Parā - these are the names of the eight Yogadrishtis. Listen to their characteristics!"**

To explain these eight Yogadrishtis, it is said:

**"Like the presence or absence of clouds, or like the presence or absence of a fetus, the eight Yogadrishtis are to be understood as based on the wrong view."**

**Explanation:**  The names "Mitrā," "Tārā," etc., are the actual names of the eight Yogadrishtis. Listen carefully to their characteristics, which are described here. The term "Yogadrishti" is used here to exclude "Aghdrishtī."

**Explanation:**  "Aghdrishtī" is of various types due to the unique nature of the destruction of karma, which obscures knowledge.

**"Sameghā, Ameghā, Rājyā, etc., like the presence or absence of clouds, or like the presence or absence of a fetus."**

The word "ādi" (etc.) includes the day, meaning that it refers to the presence or absence of clouds during the day or night. The word "ādi" (etc.) also includes the absence of a fetus, meaning that it refers to the presence or absence of a fetus. Therefore, it is like the presence or absence of a fetus, or like the presence or absence of a fetus.

**"Jodbdir"** - The general vision, which is based on the perception of the soul. This means that it is possessed by the soul who is attached to the world.

**"Shivāditāshā"** - Those who are based on the wrong view or those who are not based on the wrong view. Those whose vision is impaired by things like glass (pearl-shell) are those who are based on the wrong view. Those who are not impaired by it are those who are not based on the wrong view. This is the literal meaning of the word "Ābh" (sky). The meaning is as follows: 

Page #122:
---------------------------
(56)
The **yogadakiṭasamuccaya** should be known here as being with or without **megha** (clouds), in the night or day; with or without **graha** (planets), like a child, etc., as **oghadṛṣṭi** (perception of the multitude);
It is also to be known as being based on **mithyādrṣṭi** (false perception) or **amithyādrṣṭi** (true perception).
**Vivecana** (Commentary): "In the dense, cloudy night, the child is blind and confused; like the small, fleeting glimpses, so are the perceptions of the multitude." - **Vīra**
**Śrī Yaśovijayajīkṛta Śrī K. D. Sažāya 1-2**: One is **samegha** (with clouds) - perception in a cloudy night, which is somewhat limited in its grasp; the other is **amegha** (without clouds) - perception in a cloudless night, which is somewhat more extensive in its grasp; the word **ādi** (etc.) refers to perception in the day. So, one is **samegha** (with clouds) - perception in a cloudy day, and the other is **amegha** (without clouds) - perception in a cloudless day. And there is a difference between these two.
This perception is also that of a **sagṛha** (with planets) - one whose perception is filled with **bhūta** (elements), etc., and the word **ādi** (etc.) refers to that of an **agṛha** (without planets) - one whose perception is not filled with planets. There is also a difference between these two, due to the difference in **citra** (image) and **vibhrama** (illusion), etc. - This is also the perception of a **bālaka** (child), and the word **ādi** (etc.) refers to that of an **abālaka** (adult). There is also a difference between these two, due to the difference in **viveka** (discrimination) and **viklata** (confusion), etc.
This is also the perception of a **mithyādrṣṭi** (false perception) - one whose perception is obstructed or covered by **kāca** (glass), **pāla** (pearl), **netraroga** (eye disease), etc.; and that of an **amithyādrṣṭi** (true perception) - one whose perception is not obstructed or covered by **kāca** (glass), etc.
Just as this difference in perception - even in the same object - is due to the difference in **citra** (image) and **upādhi** (conditions), so also in **pāralaūkika prameya** (knowledge of the other world) - knowledge related to the other world - there is a difference in **pratipatti** (understanding) due to the difference in **kṣayopaśama** (destruction and cessation). (There is a difference in **mānyatā** (belief) and **grahaṇa** (grasp).) For this reason, **darśanabheda** (difference in perception) - the difference in different perceptions - is said to be **gāca** (firm).
Indeed, this **darśanabheda** (difference in perception) is not the goal of **sthira** (stable) etc. **drṣṭi** (perception) - those who have different **granthi** (knots) - **yogī** (ascetics), because they have **avadhi** (direct knowledge) - true understanding - of the **naya** (principles) according to the **viṣaya** (object) and **pitṛpatā** (fatherhood). Their activity is also for the sake of others - they have a desire for pure **bodha** (knowledge) - therefore, they have become completely free from **āgraha** (attachment) - therefore, they are subservient to **mitrī** (friendship) etc. - therefore, and their **āśaya** (intention) is characterized by **gambhīra** (serious) and **udāra** (generous) **cāricarika** (conduct) - according to the **sanjīvanī** (life-giving) **carka** (wheel) **cāraṇa** (movement) **nīti** (ethics) (according to the four **sanjīvanī** and the four **nyāya** (principles)).

## The Eight Yogic Visions: A General Overview (57)

**Aghdristi:** This refers to the common vision, the ordinary perception. Agh means flow. Aghdristi is the vision of one who is caught in the flow of the endless cycle of existence (samsara) and finds contentment within it. This is the vision of the common beings, the ordinary souls, who are caught in the flow of the world. The common perception of worldly objects, as seen by those who follow the flow of the world, is called Aghdristi (Vision of a layman). This Aghdristi can be of different types, depending on the degree of obscuration of knowledge (jnana avaraniya), the ten types of obscurations (dasa avaraniya), and the different levels of destruction and cessation (kshaya-apashma). For example, a single scene can be perceived differently:

1. It may appear very faint in a heavily clouded night.
2. It may appear slightly clearer in a night with less cloud cover.
3. It may appear even clearer on a cloudy day.
4. It may appear very clear on a cloudless day.
5. The perception of the viewer can be affected by external influences like ghosts (bhoot) or mental disturbances (chitta vibhrama).
6. Even without such influences, the perception of the viewer can vary.
7. The perception of a child will be different from that of an adult.
8. The perception of an adult will also vary depending on their level of understanding.
9. The perception of a viewer whose vision is obscured by something like a glass (kaach) or dust will be different.
10. The perception of a viewer whose vision is not obscured will be different.

Thus, even a single scene can be perceived differently due to various external factors. These different perceptions are the different types of Aghdristi.

**Chaugdristi:** Just as there are different types of Aghdristi due to different external factors in the perception of a single worldly scene, there are also different types of Chaugdristi, different perceptions, and different understandings, due to the different levels of destruction and cessation (kshaya-apashma) in the knowledge of the other world (paraloka), the knowledge of the self (atma tattva), and other such subjects. Just as the aperture (diaphragm) of a camera can be adjusted to increase or decrease the field of vision, similarly, the level of destruction and cessation (kshaya-apashma) can increase or decrease the field of vision of the yogi (samyakdristi purusha). The more the obscurations are removed, the more the veil is lifted, the more the aperture is opened, the more the yogi (samyakdristi purusha) can perceive. Chaugdristi is the vision related to the yogi, the vision of the yogi (samyakdristi purusha) who follows the path of yoga. This is the clear distinction between Aghdristi and Chaugdristi.

##  The Collection of Yugadristi
**Verse 1-3**
"The visions that have been seen, those are just a glance; the differences in the four (types of knowledge), the Samyak Darshan (right vision) is the one to be followed..." - Veer.

**Comparison of Ghadristi and Yogadristi - Table 2**

| Feature | Ghadristi | Yogadristi |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject** | Ordinary Bhava-Abhinandi (worldly) being | Yogi, Samyak Darshan (right vision) seeker, liberated soul |
| **Object of Vision** |  Worldly | Transcendental, Self-knowledge, etc. |
| **Method of Vision** | Worldly-practical, flowing, like a river | Transcendental, spiritual, path of Yoga, like a well, grasping the truth |
| **Reason for Difference** |  Subtle difference in the destruction of karma | Subtle difference in the destruction of karma |
| **Speciality** |  Possibility of debate regarding the difference in vision |  Impossibility of debate regarding the difference in vision |

**Explanation:**

Thus, due to the subtle difference in the destruction of karma, there is a difference in vision. Therefore, the different (Vedanta, Jain, etc.) visions have been differentiated. This is the statement of the Yogacharya.

But those who have a stable vision, the Samyak Darshan (right vision) seekers with different interpretations, do not have this difference in vision in their minds. They do not consider this difference in opinions and visions, they do not give it existence. Like ordinary people, they are not carried away by the insistence on opinions and visions. They see only one path, one vision - the vision of the Self. They see only one Self-knowledge, not a difference. All these visions are rooted in the same Self-knowledge, only the "vision is different" - they believe this with a pure heart. They know these six visions as aspects of the pure Self-knowledge or as a means of guidance. Therefore, they do not engage in the intricacies of refutation and justification. Instead, they worship these six visions with Samyak Darshan (right vision). Because,

"All those are one, all visions are the same understanding; the understanding of the Syadvada is also true. If you ask me about the original state, I will tell you that it is the same for all." 

Page #125:
---------------------------
A General Statement on Eight Yogadrishtis

Different opinions are seen, this is the perspective of difference;
In the root of one principle, the definition is accepted.” Abandoning the opinions of philosophies, their insistence and alternatives
This path is said to be the one that will lead, birth will be less.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji

“Six philosophies are taught in the Jain scriptures, along with the six limbs;
The devotee of the liberated Jinas, worships the six philosophies.” - Shri Anandghanji

Thus, the great souls, the enlightened beings, say this, because they have a proper understanding of the limits, they know how to divide the Nayas appropriately. It is like this - Nay means a difference in perspective, it is infinite. From a certain perspective, a certain thing, from a certain point of view (Angle of vision), its name is “Nay”. Thus, all the Nayas, their division, their form according to their subject matter, according to their limited scope, they understand properly. Therefore, they conclude that
These different philosophies that different philosophers have created, they have done so from different perspectives, from different points of view. They are correct from that perspective, so why argue? What is the dispute? The expansion that arises from permutations and combinations is infinite, it is merely a play of words. As many words as there are, so many Nayas there are, therefore, we should abandon all these Nayas, without attachment or aversion, with a pure heart, in the investigation of the true self, “we should dive in”, that is our only work. If we do that, everything will be revealed on its own, so why all this talk? This is what the great souls feel.

Again, the Jagadguru says, “All partiality is false;
Attachment and aversion are also forbidden, dive into the self... Munisuvrat, whoever meditates on the self, he is known by that name, all else is a play of words, this principle brings clarity to the mind... Munisuvrat.” - Shri Anandghanji

Again, if one Nay is held in isolation, with exclusive insistence, it is not a Nay, but an illusion of a Nay, it is falsehood, this is what the impartial, enlightened beings with the perspective of Anekanta say. 

Page #126:
---------------------------
(60)
They understand the collection of yogic perspectives well, and therefore they place the term "syad" at the forefront, without rejecting it, and through this they examine the essence of that philosophy. And by examining the essence in this way, it becomes clear to the Syadvadi community that all these ten philosophies are one, in the form of the Jina philosophy, or the pure self-philosophy, which is the form of the Purusha. In this way, the Jina philosophy, which is like a wish-fulfilling tree, has Sankhya philosophy and Yoga philosophy as its two feet; Buddhism and Mimamsa are its two strong arms; the KAyatika view is its trunk, which is the foundation of its philosophy; and the Jina philosophy, which is the best of all philosophies, adorns its head in the form of external and internal perspectives. Thus, by placing the term "dhuri" - the first position - as the foundation, the followers of the Jina philosophy worship the six philosophies.
Therefore, they are extremely moderate. How can they refute the limbs of their father?
"I praise the feet of the Jina, the Sankhya and Yoga are different;
They explain the power of the self, they are the cause of suffering and the body, they are not different... Six. The difference and non-difference of all, the Mimamsa, the Jina's burden is heavy;
We worship the Kalika, we understand it through the Guru... Six. The KAyatika is the womb of the Jina, the thought that is in it;
The philosophy of truth is a good path, without the Guru, what is the use?... Six. The Jain Jineshwar is the best limb, the inner and outer;
The foundation is the word, the worshiper, he worships with it... Six."
- Shri Anandghanji, etc., in this way, the "philosophy of truth is a good path" of these great souls continues uninterruptedly, how can these great souls have any attachment to different views and philosophies?
Similarly, the activities of these great people are also for the sake of others - for the sake of the Supreme Self. "For the sake of others, for the sake of the Supreme Self" - these saintly souls' virtues are for the benefit of others. They offer their father all their limbs on the altar of the sacrifice of the welfare of the people, they expend all their power of mind, speech, and body for the sake of others. The benefit that their father receives from the soul - the Supreme Self - is also received by other beings, with this pure love for the Supreme Self, these righteous souls perform activities for the sake of the Supreme Self.

## A General Statement of the Eight Yogadrishtis
(61)

"Jan, Pashu, Lek, Kalyan, Yash, Par, Hem, Ang, Sah, Mahara." - This is the nature of Saraswati Chandra and their selfless activities. This is because:

1. **Purity of Knowledge:** The Samyagdristi Purusha possesses pure knowledge, free from the impurities of raga, dvesha, and moha. It is pure and untouched by external influences.
2. **Absence of Attachment:** They are completely free from all kinds of attachments, including opinions, views, and desires. They are extremely balanced and impartial.
3. **Subservience to the Meritorious:** They are deeply moved by the four emotions of Maitri (friendship), Pramoda (joy), Karuna (compassion), and Upeksha (equanimity). They have friendship towards the entire world. They experience joy when they see virtue anywhere. "Even a particle of virtue is like a mountain to these rare saints, who cultivate it deeply in their hearts." They feel compassion for the suffering world. "These poor creatures of the world are abandoning the right path and indulging in madness, causing themselves suffering. I must guide them back to the right path and free them from this suffering," this is the compassionate thought that arises in their minds. And if someone has a contrary nature and is unable to understand, they remain indifferent and maintain a balanced attitude.
4. **Serious and Generous Intent:** Their intent and mental state are both serious and profound, unfathomable and immeasurable, like the ocean. Their intent is also generous and expansive, encompassing everyone like the vast expanse of the ocean. These Samyagdristi Yogis are like "Sagarpeta" (ocean-like) and "Sarva-valami-mir" (all-encompassing).
5. **Following the Four Principles of Charisangivani:** These Samyagdristi individuals with serious and generous intent follow the four principles of Charisangivani. These are:

- **Four Principles of Charisangivani:** "Charis Jeevani Charan Naya Esh Satan Matha. Naya Strudhi Thashe Veladinan!" (Shri Yogabindu, 119) These four principles of Charisangivani are the principles of the righteous. Those who do not follow them, especially those who initiate religious activities, will not achieve their desired success. 

Page #128:
---------------------------
(62)
The collection of stories here, in the chapter on conduct, is about a special type of medicine called Sanjeevani, which revives life. This is the story of Sanjeevani, which illustrates four principles. The meaning of this story can be understood from the following:

There was a city called 'Swastimati', filled with citizens. In this city, there was a Brahmin's daughter, and she had a friend who was the object of her unwavering love. Later, they both got married and started living in different places.

One day, the Brahmin's daughter started worrying about her friend. So, she went to her friend's place and saw her immersed in sorrow and grief. She asked her, "Friend, why is your face so pale?" Her friend replied, "I am unfortunate, because of my wicked husband." The Brahmin's daughter said, "Don't be sad! There is no difference between sorrow and poison, sorrow is like poison. I will turn your husband into a bull using a root." Saying this, she gave her the root and went to her father's house.

Later, the unhappy Brahmin's daughter gave the root to her husband, and immediately he turned into a strong bull. Then, she felt remorse in her heart and thought, "How can this man, who was capable of all tasks, become like this again?" After that, she started taking him out every day to graze with a group of bulls.

One day, the bull was resting under a banyan tree. A couple of celestial beings, who were also resting on the branches of the tree, started talking to each other. One of the celestial beings said, "This bull is not like this by nature, but because of a contrary quality. His wife gave him a root." The other celestial being asked, "How can he become a man again?" The first celestial being replied, "By using another root." The female celestial being asked, "Where is it?" He said, "It is under this tree."

Hearing this, the animal's wife (the Brahmin woman), who was filled with remorse, started grazing the bull without knowing the secret. She let him graze freely, and while grazing, he ate the root. Immediately, the bull turned back into a man.

This is an example that suggests absolute impartiality. It does not favor any particular philosophy or opinion. But it is a gentle teaching that encourages all seekers of truth to find the essence of 'Sanjeevani' through meditation. This policy is excellent for those who are starting on the path of Dharma, as it encourages them to take rebirth.

## A General Statement of the Eight Yogadrishtis

(63) Following the principle of "Charisangivani Nyaya" as per the Upanaya-Paramarth, this Samyagdristi, the perfect vision of the wise, follows the best impartial ethics that advocates the truth. These "impartial rare ones", 
who grasp the essence of all philosophies, these saintly Avadhutas, remain immersed in their own nature, always impartial and rare. They serve the pure purpose of uplifting the people by spreading the "Sangivani Nyaya" in all directions, benefiting and bringing welfare to the world. This is the supreme blessed activity that the Samyagdristi Mahatmas perform. "They grasp the essence of all philosophies, they remain in their own nature; they benefit the people with Sangivani, they spread it in all directions... Veer."

Sri Ye, Da, Sakzaya, 1-4, we are stating the subject matter presented in the text, and the nature is the four Yogadrishtis, which are different from Mitra, etc. And these are of eight types, as stated in the example:

तृणगोमयकाष्ठाग्निकणदीपप्रभोपमा ।
रत्नतारार्कचन्द्राभाः सददृष्टिदृष्टिरष्टया ॥१५॥

Vritti - Here, the authorized-presented vision is clearly stated based on its meaning. It is explained through the analogy of examples like grass, cow dung, etc. - The vision of the wise with Samyagdristi is of eight types, starting from the general:

1. **Mitra:** Similar to grass and cow dung, it is not capable of performing the desired action due to the truth. Because: (1) It does not have the state until the time of the correct experiment, and due to its smallness, the development of the seed of skillful and firm memory does not occur, it does not have skillful memory-seeds; (2) And due to the presence of a different experiment, the action of worship, etc., is different from the feeling, therefore.

2. **Tara:** It is similar to cow dung and fire. This is also almost the same - due to the alternative of a different state-power from the truth, therefore, again, due to the lack of memory-power during the time of the experiment. Due to its absence, the experiment is different, and therefore, in this way, due to the lack of its function.

3. **Bala:** This is also like all the wood and fire, and it is somewhat different from the previous two. Therefore, there is a little state-power here; that is, there is a skillful memory like a skilled person during the time of the experiment: and it is, there is a feeling of unity with the object of desire only due to the love of the object.

4. **Dipa:** It is equal to the light of the lamp, and it is much more different from the previous three, therefore, and there is a strong state-power, therefore, the memory is also skillful during the time of the experiment. Although it is due to feeling, there is an influx of matter in worship, etc., and due to the type of devotion and the difference in activity, therefore,

##  Samuccaya of Right Vision

**Trina, gamaya, and wood, like a spark of fire; the light of a lamp, where is the comparison? Jewels, stars, the sun and the moon are similar;**

**Thus, the eight types of Right Vision, from the perspective of Right Vision, are known.**

**15. This is the excellence of the first Gunasthanaka - the peak, the ultimate limit, as the scriptures of time say.**

**5. Stable, different granthi - that is, the one whose granthi is differentiated, only such Samyagdasti has differentiated knowledge. It is like a bound jewel-light. It has the following qualities: (1) Unopposed - not affected, (2) Increasing - growing, (3) Without remedy - without obstacles, (4) Not causing suffering to others, (5) The purpose of Pariteshana, and (6) The birthplace of Parigyan, etc.**

**6. In Kanta - this knowledge is like the light of a star. Therefore, it is naturally inherent. Here, the practice is: (1) Without transgression, (2) Following pure Upanga, (3) Associated with specific non-negligence, (4) Predominantly engaged, (5) And with a serious and generous intention.**

**7. In Prabha - it is like the light of the sun, penetrating. (1) It is always the object of meditation, (2) Here, there is rarely an opportunity for Vikalpa, and (3) Here, there is the happiness of Prashamsara (that which is good for Prasham). Here: (4) Other scriptures are Akinchitakara - useless, unable to do anything, (5) There is Samadhi-based practice, (6) In its presence, hatred, etc., are destroyed, "Tarani dhau vairaadi naara" (7) It is a benefactor, (8) It has propriety towards the student, (9) And there is unwavering, virtuous action.**

**8. In Para - it is like the light of the moon, bound. It is always considered to be in the form of Sayana, without Vikalpa. (1) Due to the absence of Vikalpa, there is supreme happiness, (2) Like the ascent of a climber, here there is no practice of Pratikramana, etc. - what is there to climb for one who has already climbed? (3) Benevolence - according to Yatha-bhavya-tva, (4) And there is unwavering, virtuous action as before.**

**Thus, the vision of Right Vision, from the general to the specific, is of eight types. Here, it is said that Right Vision is differentiated by granthi. And that granthi differentiation occurs over a long period of time, after which the vision of Right Vision is of eight types. How?**

**Solution - Due to the infallible purpose of Right Vision, the visions of Mitra, etc., are also true. In the production of pure, refined sugar, sugarcane, juice, Kavu, and Gola are like Mitra, etc.; and sugar, refined sugar, impure sugar lumps, and pure sugar crystals are like the other four visions, as the Acharyas say. Because the transformation of Dhak (sugarcane), etc., occurs in that way.**

**These Mitra, etc., are only objects of taste, etc. - there is taste, etc., in these Mitra, etc., because they have the potential for sweetness. And those like Nal, etc., are not of that type - due to the absence of sweetness in the form of Sangara. - From this, it is said that there is no differentiation of vision in the completely non-resultant or momentary Atmavada. Because there is no potential for transformation of that type, it is not possible to transform in that way.**

## The Eightfold Vision: A General Statement

(65) Meaning: The vision of a person with a pure vision is of eight types, where the comparison is made (respectively) to the diminishing intensity of the light of a fire made with grass, a fire made with cow dung, a fire made with wood, a lamp, a gem, a star, the sun, and the moon. For example, the vision of a friend is like the fire made with grass, the vision of a star is like the fire made with cow dung, and so on.

## Commentary

Here, we come to the core subject of this scripture. This is a statement about the eightfold vision. To understand it clearly, an example is given using a comparison. The author, the sage, has used this comparison with such skill and expertise that the meaning of the vision can be easily understood from the comparison itself.

These eight visions are compared to (1) the fire made with grass, (2) the fire made with cow dung, (3) the fire made with wood, (4) the light of a lamp, (5) the light of a gem, (6) the light of a star, (7) the light of the sun, and (8) the light of the moon. Just as the intensity of light increases from grass to the moon, the intensity of vision increases from the vision of a friend to the vision of the Supreme. Therefore, this comparison is complete and comprehensive.

The great and powerful sage Shrimad Rajchandraji has compared this eightfold vision to a thermometer, which is also a very appropriate and fitting comparison. Just as a thermometer can measure the temperature of the body, this eightfold vision can measure the spiritual progress of the soul, its state, and its spiritual qualities.

"In which vision am I situated? Do I possess the qualities mentioned for that vision? If not, how should I strive to attain them?" By introspectively examining these questions, one can receive inspiration for the growth of one's spiritual qualities. This eightfold vision is a great boon and benefit to the seeker of liberation.

To understand its nature, the example of a school is given. Its meaning is as follows:

1. The vision of a friend: "Where there is a friend, there is attachment, like the fire made with grass." - Shri D. Sakzaya. In the vision of a friend, the understanding is like the fire made with grass.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
This drishti is not capable of showing the desired object, nor can it show the desired objects through the aetha-tattva (paramath). Because: (1) Just as a straw fire does not last long enough to get a proper understanding of the luminous object, so also this drishti does not remain stable for long enough to properly experience the aetha. (2) Just as the light of a straw fire is weak and has little power, so also the aetha of this drishti is weak and has little power. (3) Just as the light of a straw fire comes and goes in an instant, and therefore does not leave a firm and lasting memory, so also here the aetha is so short-lived and weak that it does not leave a firm and lasting memory. (4) And thus, due to the instability and weakness of the aetha, and the lack of memory, just as a straw fire is completely incapable of performing any real work, so also this drishti has such an incomplete and flawed nature that it cannot perform any real work, such as devotion, etc.

Tṛṇu Agni Sam Mitra
2. Tara Drishti
....
- Dan Tara drishti ma....manmahan mere, gamya agni saman....man.”—Shri Cha. Da. Sajjaya. The aetha in the second drishti, called Tara, can be compared to a dung fire, because the light of a dung fire is stronger than that of a straw fire, just as the aetha of Tara drishti is stronger than that of Mitra drishti, but it is almost the same because it does not have the nature of a gamya agni. Because: (1) Just as the light of a dung fire does not last long and is weak, so also here, like Mitra drishti, the aetha-tattva does not last long and is weak. (2) And therefore, during the practice of the aetha in life, there is no firmness or skill in memory, and no firm memory remains. (3) And without such memory, the practice is also flawed and incomplete. (4) And therefore, such devotion, etc., cannot be achieved, and there is only material devotion, etc. Thus, except for the absence of aetha, everything else is the same as Mitra drishti.

3. Khala Drishti
“The third drishti is called Khala, and it is like a wood fire.”—Shri Cheg. Sajjaya. 

Page #133:
---------------------------
## The Common Nature of the Eight Yogadrishtis

**(67) The third dristi, called Bala, has a bodha that is likened to the fire of wood, because the bodha here is slightly more powerful than the bodha of the Mitra and Tara dristi. (1) Just as the light of a wood fire lasts a little longer, and the wood fire is slightly more powerful, so too, the bodha of this dristi is slightly more stable and lasts longer, and is slightly more powerful. (2) Therefore, there is a memory like that of a skilled person, almost a firm memory. (3) And because of this, there is some effort in the activity due to the fondness for the practice of the meaning, the purpose, and the practice.

**4. Deepa Dristi**

"The Deepa Dristi is like the light of a lamp," says Shri Go Sahaj.

The bodha in the fourth dristi, called Deepa, is likened to the light of a lamp. Just as the light of a lamp is much greater than the light of grass, cow dung, or wood fire, so too, the bodha of this dristi is more powerful than the bodha of the Mitra, Tara, and Bala dristi. Therefore, (1) this bodha is more stable, like a Deepa, it lasts longer and is more powerful. (2) And because of this, there is a skilled memory during the practice of the right conduct. (3) However, here, the actions like bowing, etc., are still due to the material, not the feeling, because there is a clear distinction between the material and the feeling due to the nature of the division:

"Those who serve, bow, and offer salutations, and those who praise the virtues; the desire for non-duality of feeling, is achieved through the feeling of others." - Shri Devchandraji

Furthermore, just as the light of a lamp depends on external causes, it shines as long as there is oil, and it goes out when the oil runs out, so too, the bodha of this dristi depends on external motivating causes, and when they are removed, it is possible for it to be extinguished. The light of a lamp is unstable, it does not have a constant light, so too, the bodha of this dristi is unstable, it increases and decreases according to the rate of decay. The light of a lamp can be extinguished by the wind, so too, here, it is possible for the bodha to be extinguished by adverse external causes. Thus, in many ways, the Deepa Dristi is similar to the light of a lamp.

Thus, up to these four dristi, there is the "first Mithyatva Gunasthanak." Even in it... 

Page #134:
---------------------------
(68)
**The Collection of Yugadristi**

This first Gunasthanak is attained in the Dipra Dristi, which is the ultimate limit of the four Dristi.  Therefore, in the four Dristi of Mitra, etc., the proportion of Mithyatva decreases progressively, and the proportion of the resulting Gun increases progressively. Thus, in the fourth Dristi, the Gunasthanak has the least amount of Mithyatva and the highest amount of Gun. Therefore, in the Dipra Dristi, the Gunasthanak with the least amount of Mithyatva and the highest amount of Mithyatva is found. After that, from the fifth Sthira Dristi onwards, there is no Mithyatva at all.

**5. Sthira Dristi**

“Dristi Sthiramahi Darshan Nitya, Ratnaprabha Sam Jane Re.” - Shri, Go Sazay

The fifth Sthira Dristi is only for the Samyagdristivant Purusha, who has experienced Granthibhed, i.e., whose knot of Karma, which is the result of Raga-Dvesha, has been severed. It is only for the Bhedgyani, the Atmajgyani. This Purusha has the experience of Bhedgyan-Atmajgyan, which is the knowledge of the pure Ratna-like Atma, which is completely different from the body and all other external objects. “I am the Atma, who is one, stable, pure, full of Darshan-Gyan, and always formless. I am not anything else, not even a single Paramanu.” This is the unshakeable, stable conviction of the Bhedgyani, Atmadristi Purusha.

"Ahamikko Khalu Suddho Dasananamiao Sadaravi. Navi Asthi Majjnya Kinchivi Anna Paramanumittapi."
Shri Kundakundacharya's Shri Samyasar

And that is why this Dristi is called Sthira. The Bodh that arises in it is said to be like the light of a gem, which is also appropriate, because the light of a gem is also stable, it does not waver. Similarly, the Bodh of the Samyagdristi Purusha is also stable, it does not waver, it does not move. Even when there is a Vajapat* and the entire universe is trembling with fear, the Samyagdristi Purusha remains fearless, leaving all doubts behind, knowing that he is not harmed.

* "Samyagdristi Ev Saahasamidam Kartum Kshamate Param,
_ Yadale'pi Patatyami Bhaychalatrailokyamuktavaani. Sarvamev Nisarganirbhayataya Shankam Vihay Swayam, Jananta: Syam Avadhya Bodhavashan Bodhaccyavante Na Hi."
Shri Amritchandracharya's Samyasarkalash

The General Statement of the Eight Stages of Insight
(9)
This right-faith man, who knows himself as the non-corporeal Self, is not freed from the bonds! This ultimate feat can only be accomplished by the right-faith man!”
Just as the wind cannot touch or extinguish the steady light of a gem, so too, the upsurges of the wind of afflictions cannot touch or extinguish the steady ground of the right-faith, self-knowing one. And that is why this insight is:
1. **Impregnable** - Just as the gem is impervious to light, never having moved, so too, this insight is impervious to knowledge, once it has come, it never falls back.
“Just as the wind cannot reach the gem, nor can its fickle nature ever diminish its brilliance;
Just as the gem is always beautiful, its strong qualities never become weak.” - Shri Yashvijayji
2. **Ever-present** - Just as the brilliance of a gem shines even more brightly when tested with the touchstone of experimentation, so too, this right-faith man’s bondlessness, when tested with the touchstone of self-experience, becomes increasingly powerful and grows.
“The sun’s brilliance never diminishes, even when it is tested;
It is the brilliance of all brilliance, increasing from the beginning.” - Shri Yashvijayji
3. **Independent** - When the oil runs out, the lamp is extinguished, but this loss (harm) does not affect the gem, so its light is independent, never extinguished; similarly, here, because there is no dependence on anything else, it is independent, no harm can reach it, it is never extinguished, never put out; because it does not depend on anything else that could be lost and cause it harm, it is self-reliant, self-dependent, and therefore completely free from all obstacles. This gem-lamp shines in the temple of the mind, destroying all enemies! It destroys all darkness! And it illuminates the brilliance of experience! The lamp that is lit, remains lit! It is never extinguished.
“O friend, the Jineshwar Dev, the gem-lamp shines brightly,
It shines in the temple of my mind, destroying all enemies.
It destroys all darkness, and the brilliance of experience shines brightly.
There is no smoke of karma, the footprints of the mind never move.
The good karmic matter does not burn, it is in a pure state.” - Shri Navvijay Sushishya, the reader Yash says this.
- Shri Yashvijayji 

Page #136:
---------------------------
(70)
**4. Not Causing Distress to Others** - Just as the light of a gem is cool and pure, not causing distress to others, so too, this insight, due to the calming of passions and their objects, is cool and pure, not causing distress or affliction to others. Not only that, but it also becomes the cause of supreme peace for other beings by practicing non-violence and other virtues.

**5. The Purpose of Satisfaction** - Just as the light of a gem brings satisfaction, its brilliance pleases the eye, and the mind becomes happy, and one does not feel like looking at trivial things like glass, etc., so too, this insight brings satisfaction to the soul, creates mental happiness, and having seen the ultimate self-realization, which was worth seeing, the curiosity to see trivial external things is extinguished, and the soul remains eternally absorbed in itself, becoming satisfied and content.

**6. The Birthplace of Examination, etc.** - (5) Just as the gem's own light reveals all sides of the gem, and also allows the knowledge of other objects, so too, the radiant light of this insight reveals the formless soul and other things clearly. Through the light of the two gems, the self-knowing person with right vision sees things as they are.

"The object itself is illuminated by the light, the treasure of bliss is the abode." - Shri Anandghanji. Just as a gem reveals the value of other things like glass, etc., and one clearly understands how much a piece of glass is worth compared to a real diamond, so too, the gem of insight reveals the value of other trivial objects, and in the presence of the unique gem of the soul, other things seem worthless.

(4) The attainment of a superior gem is considered auspicious, it increases wealth, happiness, prosperity, etc., and removes evil, so too, the attainment of this superior gem of insight becomes the cause of all auspiciousness, welfare, and all good fortune.

"The most radiant of all!" "Unthinkable power is itself the god, the gem of pure consciousness is itself the gem of thought." - Shri Samayasarakalash.

"The self-realized person is always content, the self-realized person is always satisfied." - Gita. "This is the eternal bliss, always be content, always be in this state." - Shri Samayasar.

The eight yogadristi. Generalization
(11) The samandharma of this steady dristi's medha has been discussed. However, within the son of the kel, there is a matter within the matter, how can its expanse be done?
etc. in many ways, with Ratnaprabha, as much as possible, in brief
comparison is there, it is here, so the knower's
66
Just as the kel falls, falls, falls;
So the knower's mat falls, falls, falls.
6. Kanta Dristi
::
The sixth dristi is now called Kanta, there is the light of the star. - Shri Yog 0 Sajjay
In the sixth Kanta dristi, there is a light like the light of a star. This 'Kanta' dristi, Kanta means a devoted wife! There is a supreme feeling. Just as a devoted wife, while doing all the other work of the house, thinks only of her husband, so the members of this dristi, like Kanta, may be doing other work, but their mind remains constantly absorbed in Shrutadharma. Due to the influence of karma, they have to do samsara...bandhi like the servant of the chitthi, but even in that, there is their non-attachment. Their supreme attachment-devotion, supreme love is only in Shrutadharma, that is, 'the knower's relationship with Shravana'
Kanta
which is the teaching, etc., dharma, is towards him.
"The mind of the woman is on her beloved, doing other work; so the mind holds firm in the Shruta, the knower's knowledge..."
Dhan Dhan Shasan Shri Jinavartan, 'Shri Yog 0 Sajjay This Kanta dristi has been compared to the light of a star, which is also very appropriate, because the light of a star is more than the light of a gem, so the medha of this dristi is more radiant - more profound than the steady dristi. The light of a star shines in the sky, remaining naturally - naturally situated, it is like a Dhruva Kanta, it is always present, unbroken; so the medha of this dristi also shines in the Chidakasha, remaining naturally situated, it remains Dhruva, it is always present, unbroken.
Star light
And that is why there is a feeling of this kind, practice-active conduct. The activity that follows knowledge is called 'practice'. So this Samyagyani has attained self-knowledge, he performs actions that are in accordance with that self-knowledge, that is, he constantly strives to perform actions that are in accordance with the soul, to follow the right conduct, to maintain the right conduct. This complete practice is full of worship-devotion, repentance, rejection, criticism, etc. He desires to become one with the soul, the Lord, and to be free from the influence of others. 

Page #138:
---------------------------
(72)
Yogasthi Samuccaya

Thus, the soul itself becomes filled with devotion. By turning away from and eliminating all the karmic impurities of the past, the soul itself becomes repentant. By turning away from and eliminating all the karmic impurities of the future, the soul itself becomes renunciant. By constantly observing all the impurities of the present, and by constantly reflecting on them with self-awareness, the soul itself becomes self-critical. Thus, by constantly renouncing, constantly repenting, and constantly self-criticizing, the soul itself becomes virtuous. * Thus, the practice, conduct, and character of this virtuous person is as follows:

1. Niratichar - Since it is devoid of any attachment to all beings, there is no transgression in it; there is no transgression (Transgression) in the form of movement in attachment.
2. Shuddhopayag Anusari - This is the practice of the self-realized person who follows pure use - the self-nature. Just as the lotus leaf is in water but not wet, I am also detached. No other feeling enters me. Thus, I am unique. Like the ocean, my self-nature is eternally organized. Thus, I am constant. Seeing beyond the cycle of existence, I am undifferentiated - like gold, I am one undivided substance. Looking at my own nature, I am free from karmic impurities. Thus, this person contemplates the pure soul, and by contemplating the pure, solitary soul, he drinks the nectar of non-dualistic bliss.

> "Parayaasthi na drijiye, ek j kanak abhang re,
> "Nivikulp ras pijjiye, shudd nirjan ek re." - Shri Anandghanji
> "Aatm bhavana bhaavta, jeev lahe kevalgyaan re." (Shrimud Rajchandra)

3. Vishisht Apramad Yukt - Since this virtuous person is filled with such pure self-awareness, he does not experience any delusion in the form of a loss of self-nature, and the subtle nature of objects, passions, attachment, aversion, etc. diminishes.
4. Viniyog Pradhan - This person, having known, realized, and practiced the knowledge-wisdom, applies it correctly - in its proper place (Practical application), and connects other beings to Dharma, so that his own Dharma tradition does not break.

* "Niccam pacchakkhanam kuvvai nicca ya padikkamadi jo. Niccam bahocey te du akhin varu thya. ||" - Shri Samaysar
* "Jo parasadi appaanam abaddapudham annanayam niyadam. Anilesamaangutt te mudralaru vichadi." - Shri Samaysar

## The Eightfold Right View: A General Statement
(73)

5. **Deep and Generous Intent:** This Right View, the knowledge of the self, is characterized by a deep and generous intent in the practice of Dharma. The yogi with this view is "as deep as the ocean."
As this realization is the essence of life,
Knowing the self as distinct and unattached...listen to the Jinas, the original path; that stable nature, it arises, the name is character, it is without form...the origin." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

7. **Radiant View:** "The radiant view is like the radiance of the sun, the knowledge is like the radiance of the sun, the object of meditation is this view." - Shri Gadh Sakzayi
In the seventh radiant view, the sun is like the knowledge. The sun's light is many times greater than the stars, similarly, the seventh view is many times stronger and deeper than the sixth view. It is rightly called "radiant" because "pra+bha" means "excellent light," which is the same as the radiance. Just as the sun's radiance is extremely bright, so too is the knowledge-radiance of this view. Just as the sun's light illuminates all objects and the world, so too does the knowledge-light of this view illuminate all objects. This is the truth of the analogy. And this view has this excellent knowledge-light, therefore:

1. **Always the Object of Meditation:** This knowledge is constantly the object of meditation. The yogi in this state meditates on the self without interruption.
2. **Mostly Without Thought:** Because this self-meditation is intense and self-sufficient, there is rarely an opportunity for any thought to arise.
3. **Blissful Peace:** And because of this thought-free meditation, there is blissful peace, peace that is the essence, peace that is paramount. From the beginning, the yogi experiences supreme bliss from the peace of the self and detachment. Because this bliss is not dependent on anything else, there is no dependence, no subjugation, therefore there is no cause for suffering; and because it is only self-dependent, it is independent, therefore only bliss has space.
"Everything that is dependent is a sign of suffering, that which is independent is bliss; that evil nature of the self is revealed, tell me, is that bliss or suffering?
O seeker! Hold the words of the hero in your mind." - Shri Gadh Sakzayi

This is the general nature of the Chegashtin
(75)
*
It pervades the entire universe. Just as the moon remains in the sky and illuminates the earth, without becoming earth-like; similarly, this Adh-Chandra, residing in the Chidakasha, illuminates the world like a lamp, but does not become world-like. Because what remains of the nature of pure perception when it undergoes self-transformation? Nothing, it becomes the complete nature. And if it becomes another material form, what would be its nature? No. Because becoming another material form is not its nature, but a different nature. For example, moonlight illuminates the earth, but the earth does not become moonlight. Similarly, knowledge always knows the knowable, but the knowable world never becomes knowledge - the soul. - 'Thus have the wise sages said.'
“The moon illuminates the earth, its rays make the entire earth white, but the moon never becomes earth-like, similarly, this soul, which illuminates the entire world, never becomes world-like, it always remains in its pure form of consciousness. The belief that the soul is inseparable from the world is an illusion.” - Sam Tattvasht Shrimad Rajchandraji (Ank (833)-760)
Thus, this Para-drishti is truly comparable to the moon. Because, like the moon, it remains in its form and illuminates the world, it does not pervade the world; it is complete in its own nature, and there is no entry of any other nature; it is in a pure non-dual state. And because of this, the meditation of this Para-drishti is
Nivikalpa
Dhyanasukha
Always in its own form - it is. Here, continuous supreme self-absorption is the only thing. This Yajishwar has an unbroken state of being, naturally, because the duality of other nature has been completely removed, therefore, in the state of supreme pure non-duality, it is only in the form of the self that it naturally and effortlessly plays.
Shuddha Ni-prayas Nij Bhaav Bhagi Yada, Atma Kshetre Nahi' Anya Rakshan Tada;
Ek Asahaay Ni-sang Nindvandvata, Shakti Uts'ni Hay Saho Vyaktatha....Dharman'shri Devchandrash Nivikalpa - This supreme non-dual Nivikalpa is the only thing. In this, there is no possibility of any
any alternative arising. Thus, here there is Nivikalpa self-absorption. Dhyata,

The distinction between *gadashti* (perception), *samuccaya* (collection), *dhyan* (meditation), and *dhyeya* (object of meditation) disappears; the three qualities of *jnana* (knowledge), *darshan* (vision), and *charitra* (conduct) merge into one indivisible, self-existent form; all duality ceases to exist.
“The meditator, meditation, and the object of meditation are one, we will now break down the distinctions; like milk and water, they merge into one, the reader will understand this, and we will be happy.” - Shri Yashovijayji, in his state of *nivikalpa* (without modification) *samadhi* (meditation), said, “Fear not, the three qualities are one. Lalana (the devotee) has attained the service of the Jina, the pure nectar of the *makarand* (honey).” - Bhaktraaj Devchandraji, in this supreme state of *yoga* (union), attains this *nivikalpa* state through such unbroken meditation.
“I am different from everything in every way, I am only pure consciousness, the most excellent, inconceivable happiness, I am only pure experience. Is there any distraction? Is there any modification? Is there any fear? Is there any regret? What other state is there? Pure, pure, completely pure, supremely peaceful, I am only *nivikalpa*. I am using my own form. I become absorbed, peace, peace, peace.”
- Shrimad Rajchandra, *Patranka* (833) 760. And thus, there is no modification at all, therefore, here:
1. There is supreme happiness. This *samadhi*-based, *parabrahma*-based *yogishwar* (master of yoga) experiences supreme self-bliss, becoming an “avatar of bliss.”
2. Just as there is no climbing up in the *arehan* (ascent) of the *arudha* (ascendant), similarly, here there is no *pratikamana* (retrogression) etc. *anushtan* (practice). Because, what is there to climb for one who has reached the peak of the mountain? Similarly, this *girajarajeshwar* (king of mountains) has climbed to the highest peak of the *bhega-giriraj* (mountain of knowledge), what need does he have for the support of *anushtan* etc.? Because, that *anushtan* is a means of support for climbing to the next stage. Now, in this state, that means of support is like a “*vishakumbha*” (poisonous pot), while *apratikamana* etc. are like “*amritakumbha*” (nectar pot). Therefore, such a supreme *satpurush* (righteous person) “abandons the means of support, breaks the *paraparivarti* (transformation), because he awakens as the blissful Lord through the indestructible *darshan* (vision), *jnana* (knowledge), and *vairagya* (renunciation).” x “*Padikaman Padi saran Pariharo Dharana Niyatti Ya | Jinda Garha Sohi Atthavihe | Hai Visakumbho || Apadikamanam Appadisaranam Apparihag Adharana Cheva | Agiyari 2 Bala Narhya Che Ramchamo Che - Shri Samayasar Gave 306-307.

The eight yogadristi's common understanding is not:
“The tool of alkhana which is renounced, the consequences are shared; the imperishable gift of knowledge and detachment, the treasure of joy, the Lord awakens... I fall at the feet of Veerji.”
(77)
—Yogiraj Anandghanji
3. Paropkaripanu yathaabhavyaatva pramane—This supreme virtuous person, supreme sage, supreme merciful God, after his own karma udya, with selfless compassion, teaches the world beings the pure path of welfare, and bestows upon them supreme grace and favor. This supreme four-armed Lord, like a great cloud, showers the nectar of dharma, and brings about prosperity and happiness in the world.
“Karma udya of Jinraj, worship the religion that helps... the arms of Jishnu are merciful,
66
· The Lord's great rain, enters into it;
Supreme joy and prosperity, have come to my country... Shri Nami”—Shri Devchandraji
Here, yathaabhavyaatva pramane means as it is... as one's bhavyaatva is—as it is appropriate, the remaining karma from past deeds, etc., is shared appropriately and exhausted. For example—Shri Tirthankar Bhagwan, Ganadhar Dev, Mundakevalli Bhagwan, etc.,

Sa artha yogya sukha tehathi, anantguna nireehaaji.”—Shri Chaug Sajjay
Thus, the author of the scriptures, the great sage, has revealed many secrets miraculously in a few words, giving appropriate comparisons to these eight dristi. And those few words are also very profound, so this brief explanation has been given for their clear understanding. From this, one can get some idea of these dristi in general. A detailed explanation of the nature of each dristi will be given later, when it is mentioned. Thus, these eight dristi are common to the yogi who has the six right conducts.

The concept of *Gadashti* (wrong view) and its various stages, including *Shankasamādhana* (doubt resolution), *Sad-dashtipana* (right view), and *Samyag-dashtipana* (perfect view), is a complex one that unfolds over time. It is only after the *Granthibhed* (breaking of the knot) that these stages become relevant, and even then, the *Granthibhed* itself is a process that takes place much later, as it occurs within the fifth *dashti*. 

Therefore, the first four *dashtis* – *Mitra*, etc. – are considered *Mithyadashti* (wrong views). The question arises: why are there eight *dashtis* – four *Sad-dashti* (right view) and four *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view)? The answer lies in the fact that the four *dashtis* – *Mitra*, etc. – act as the *amegh-achuk* (unwavering and infallible) cause for *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view). Consequently, due to the influence of the effect on the cause, even the *Mitra*, etc. *dashtis* are considered to be part of *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view).

To understand this, consider the following analogy:

In the process of making refined crystallised sugar from raw sugarcane, even the initial stages are crucial. The final product doesn't just appear out of thin air. It requires a series of steps, starting from the sugarcane itself.

The entire process from sugarcane to refined sugar can be divided into eight stages:

1. **Sugarcane:** This represents the initial stage, analogous to the *Mitra* *dashti*.
2. **Juice extraction:** This stage corresponds to the second *dashti*.
3. **Boiling and making *kave* (molasses):** This stage represents the third *dashti*.
4. **Making *gel* (syrup):** This stage corresponds to the fourth *dashti*.
5. **Refining and making fine sugar:** This stage represents the fifth *dashti*, where the *Granthibhed* occurs.
6. **Making *sharkara* (granulated sugar):** This stage corresponds to the sixth *dashti*.
7. **Making *ashuddha* (impure) sugar lumps:** This stage represents the seventh *dashti*.
8. **Making refined crystallised sugar:** This stage corresponds to the eighth *dashti*, representing the final stage of *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view).

Thus, before reaching the final stage of refined crystallised sugar, the process goes through various stages.

The first four stages, from sugarcane to *gel*, are analogous to the first four *dashtis* – *Mitra*, etc. – which are considered *Mithyadashti* (wrong views). The remaining four stages, from fine sugar to refined crystallised sugar, are analogous to the last four *dashtis*, which are considered *Sad-dashti* (right view) and *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view).

Just as all the stages in the sugar-making process are essential for achieving the final product, the *Mitra* *dashti*, etc., are also crucial for attaining *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view). They act as the cause for *Samyag-dashti* (perfect view). Therefore, the *Mitra* *dashti*, etc., have their rightful place within the *Gadashti* (wrong view) framework.

These *Mitra* *dashtis*, etc., are like the sugarcane, juice, etc., because they lead to the attainment of *sanvegarup* (emotional) *madhuni* (sweetness). Without the initial sugarcane, how can the juice be extracted? Without the juice, how can *gol* (molasses) or sugar be made?

Similarly, these *Mitra* *dashtis*, etc., are like the sugarcane, etc., because they inevitably lead to the manifestation of *paramarth* (ultimate) *premarup* (love-filled) *rasadi* (essence), and the experience of the sweet *sanveg* (emotion) – like the nectar of *param* (ultimate) *amrut* (nectar).

## The Commonality of the Eight Yogadrishtis (79)

On the contrary, those who are devoid of the eight yogadrishtis are like inert matter, and therefore, they never experience the sweet nectar of liberation. Just as inert matter, no matter how much you squeeze it, will not yield any juice, so too, these individuals, no matter how much they strive, will not experience the sweet nectar of liberation. They are like inert matter, devoid of the essence of love, and therefore, they will never experience the sweet nectar of liberation. Even if these individuals engage in countless material actions devoid of love, or become great scholars by studying scriptures, they will never change their nature. Just as a snake does not become a bird by drinking milk, these individuals will never change their nature. Because the seed of love never sprouts in their hearts. Therefore, they are unfit for liberation, and hence, they are called "abhavya" (devoid of the eight yogadrishtis). 

Therefore, according to the principle of "arthapatti" (inference), such individuals are also unfit to attain the eight yogadrishtis, because if they were to attain them, they would no longer be "abhavya". Only those who are "bhavya" (worthy) can attain the eight yogadrishtis, not those who are "abhavya".

**Abhavya**
**Unworthy**

**The Diminishment of Yogadrishtis in the Resultant Soul:**

As the different dristi (perspectives) evolve and change, the pure soul emerges and manifests itself. From this, it follows that:

(1) The eight yogadrishtis do not diminish in the philosophy of the "aparinama" (non-transformational) soul, which believes that the soul is eternally unchanging. 

(2) Similarly, the eight yogadrishtis do not diminish in the philosophy of the "kshanika" (momentary) soul, which believes that the soul is momentary. This is because, according to their belief, there is no transformation or evolution of the soul.

This is because:

1. If the soul is considered to be eternally unchanging, then how can the eight yogadrishtis be attained? The eight yogadrishtis are not possible without transformation, and therefore, they cannot be attained by a soul that is eternally unchanging. Therefore, either the soul must be considered to be transformable, or the eight yogadrishtis must be abandoned. 

2. If the eight yogadrishtis are abandoned, then where is the place for liberation in the philosophy of the non-transformational soul? Their concept of liberation will become a mere "kalpana" (imagination).

**The Philosophy of the Eternally Unchanging Soul**
**Unacceptable**

Page #146:
---------------------------
(80) The yogadristi samuchaya will seem crude! They will have no place to stand in this yogamarga, because in this aparinaami vaad, the main benefit of bhav-moksha will not diminish, either bhav or moksha, one of these two states will remain. If they believe that only the bhav state remains, then the purpose of the moksha sadhak yogamarga will fail; and if they believe that only the moksha state remains, then where is the need for this moksha sadhak gamarga? Thus, many evils like kritnash and akritagam will arise. Therefore, this ekant aparinaami vaad - ekant foot-standing nitya atma is inappropriate. " एवं च योगमार्गोऽपि मुक्तये या प्रकल्प्यते  /  सोडव निर्विवत्त जपनामात्रमः | "- (See) Yogabindu, 0 478-489. One says that the atma tattva is nitya, taking the atma darisan; kritvinash akritagam dusan, does not see in the mind.-Shri Anandghanaji 2.  Sarvatha kshanikvaad means that the atma is considered to be ekant anitya, then whose parinaman will happen without an akhand ek vastu? After the kshan, that atma will be destroyed, so there will be no vastu, then how will this yogadristi kshanikvaad be attained without that parinaman? It is inappropriate to believe in the anusandhan-anvaya of kshan after kshan, so kshanikvaad must be abandoned. Thus, either the parinaami atma must be considered as an ek nitya akhand vastu, or the yogadristi must be benefited itself. If this yogadristi is benefited, then kshanikvaad will have no place to stand in the gamarga; bandh-moksha, sukha-duhkha, etc. arrangements will not diminish. Saugat mati ragi says vaadi, kshanik is the atma, knows; bandh moksha sukha duhkha does not diminish, this thought brings the mind.”–Shri Anandghanaji  Again, knowing that which is kshanik, the one who says, that speaker is not kshanik, from that experience, it is also certain that the atma is nitya. Never is anything completely destroyed, only its state changes. And what does the chetan merge into, when it is destroyed in the form of state change? Investigate that. x “क्षलिाडं तु नैवारा जादूर्व विना रातः | बचश्यामवाडरिव्यथडवंचमावतः || ”—(See) Gabindu, Shlo 458-477. 

Page #147:
---------------------------
The general statement of the eight yogadrishtis (81) or the knowledge of the momentary, which is known by the speaker; the speaker does not consider it momentary, but determines it by experience. When, what thing, is only not destroyed; the conscious one is destroyed, in what does it merge? Investigate.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji-pranita Shri Atmasiddhi Parinamivad Yuka + Thus, whether the soul is considered to be eternally solitary or momentarily solitary, this yogadrishti does not diminish in that faction. Therefore, by the Artha-patti Nyaya, “It is possible to have a yogamarga by the concordance of the state differences in the soul which has a small number of synonyms.” The soul is eternally from the substance, and it changes from the synonym – from the state transition, it is momentary, its manifest example-strength, the knowledge of the three states of youth and old age occurs to the same person. The soul substance is eternal, it changes by the synonym, the three ages of childhood, etc., the knowledge occurs to one. – Shri Atmasiddhi Thus, if the soul principle is considered to be parinamivad, then this yogadrishti, which is of the nature of parinamana, and the entire occurrence of the yogamarga, occurs without any doubt, as is evident from the above. Let it be! Be it as it may! Now we proceed with the “umilan” of the yogadrishti, then it will be known automatically what the soul principle is. There is no scope for debate in it. And this “drishti” is common to all yogis, therefore, it is said to show those who are of a certain type, in the way they are – यमादियोगयुक्तानां खेदादिपरिहारतः  /  अद्वेषादिगुणस्थानं क्रमेणैषा सतां मता  //  16  //  Vritti: – Those who are united with yama, etc., with speed. Here, “yama”, etc., are called “ga” due to being a limb of yoga. It is said that – “chamanavamasanapranayama tyaradhara dhyanama dabdavakania” (Patanjal Yoga Sutra 2, 29). “Yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi are the eight limbs.” Thus, yama, etc., are due to the removal (part) of the intentions which are opposite to the practice of yoga. And these intentions are also eight. And in that way, it is said that – + “Nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate sat:। Umara datattvanachattrashimi:”—Gita *"Parinaminiyata nitiya chitra bhaave tathaatmani  //  Avsthamelatya malya hammar: »–Shragbindi

(82) The collection of eight *dṛṣṭis* (perspectives), starting with *mitrā dṛṣṭi* and ending with *sādhāraṇa dṛṣṭi*, are attained by those who are endowed with *yama* (restraint) etc., and who have abandoned *bheda* (discrimination) etc., and who have cultivated the *guṇa-sthānas* (stages of virtue) starting with *adveṣa* (non-hatred). This is the view of the saints. 

**Explanation:** These eight *dṛṣṭis* are attained by yogis who are endowed with the eight limbs of *yoga*, namely *yama*, *niyama*, etc. In other words, (1) where *yama*, the first limb of *yoga*, is present, there is the first *dṛṣṭi*, *mitrā dṛṣṭi*. Where *niyama*, the second limb of *yoga*, is present, there is the second *dṛṣṭi*, *tārā dṛṣṭi*. And so on, understand the mutual relationship between the eight. 

Similarly, (2) there are eight types of evil intentions and mental states, namely *kheda* (regret), *udvega* (anxiety), etc. When these eight are abandoned, the eight limbs of *yoga* are attained in succession. Thus, when *bheda* is abandoned, the first limb of *yoga*, *yama*, and the first *dṛṣṭi*, *mitrā dṛṣṭi*, are attained. When *udvega* is abandoned, the second limb of *yoga*, *niyama*, and the second *dṛṣṭi*, *tārā dṛṣṭi*, are attained, and so on. 

And (3) these eight *dṛṣṭis* are the stages of the virtues *adveṣa* (non-hatred), *jijñāsā* (inquiry), etc. Thus, the first *dṛṣṭi*, *mitrā dṛṣṭi*, is the stage where the virtue *adveṣa* manifests, and the second *dṛṣṭi*, *tārā dṛṣṭi*, is the stage where the virtue *jijñāsā* manifests. And so on, connect the relationship between the eight. 

"Those who are wise should abandon the mind that is attached to *kheda* (regret), *udvega* (anxiety), *lepa* (attachment), *utthāna* (arising), *bhranti* (delusion), *anyamudra* (other-mindedness), and *sanga* (attachment)."

Therefore, these eight *dṛṣṭis* are attained by abandoning *kheda* (regret) etc., and they are also the stages of the virtues *aṣa* (non-attachment) etc. This is because there are also eight of these. It has been said:

"There are eight types of activities in the path of liberation: 1. *aṣa* (non-attachment), 2. *jijñāsā* (inquiry), 3. *śuśruṣā* (service), 4. *śravaṇa* (listening), 5. *bheda* (discrimination), 6. *mīmāṁsā* (reflection), 7. *pariśuddha pratipatti* (pure understanding), and 8. *pravṛtti* (activity)."

Thus, these eight *dṛṣṭis* are accepted by the saints, such as the sage Patañjali, the venerable Bhākarabhandu, the venerable Antava, etc. We will explain the complete details of each *dṛṣṭi* in due course.

## General Statement of Eight Yogadrishti:

The eight limbs of yoga are the eight Yogadrishti, eight Yanga Anga, eight Desh Tyaga, and eight Gunasthan, which are interconnected. The first Dristi has the first Yoga Anga, the first Chitta Desh Tyaga, and the first Gun's attainment. This is how it should be understood. This way, the Bhangi decreases. Here, Yama, etc., are in the form of limbs, so they are called "G". 

**Keshtak-3**

| Dristi | Anga | Desh Tyaga, Gunasthan | Visheshta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Yama | Kheda | Advesha | Trun Agnikan Mithyatva Niyam |
| Niyam | Uga | Jijnaasa Gamaya Anikun | Asan |
| Asan | Kshepa Shushrusha | Kasht Agnikan Tara Bala | Pranayama Uthan Shravan Deep Prabha Deeka |
| Pranayama | Stira | Pratyahar | Branti Bodha Ratna Prabha |
| Pratyahar | Sammafataw Kanta Dharan Anyamudda | Mimansa Tara Prabha Prabha | Dhyan Goo (Rog) Pratipatti - Surya Prabha |
| Dhyan | Para | Samadhi | Asanga Pravritti | Chandra Praman - Yoga's eight limbs' form |

**1. Yama:** Also called Vrat. There are five: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Aparigraha. Each has four types due to their intensity: Ichchhayam, Pravrittiyam, Stiriyam, Siddhiyam.

**2. Niyam:** Shaucha, Santosha, Tap, Swadhyay, and Ishwar Dhyan are the five Niyams.

**3. Asan:** From the material, the body's agility is stopped, and it becomes stable in one place, like Padmasana, Virasana, etc. From the feeling, it is the Asan of the other feeling - Adhyas - leaving the sitting, sitting in the feeling of the self - doing the sitting is Asan.

**4. Pranayama:** The gross physical Pranayama named Hag's action is not desired here. Because in it, the air is expelled (Rechan), filled (Puran), and stabilized like water in a pitcher (Kumbhan); these processes are the body's... 

Page #150:
---------------------------
(84) The accumulation of bodily perception is laborious and causes the mind to be fickle, hence it is a high form of affliction. Therefore, this external pranayama is not intended here. Here, the spiritual-feeling pranayama is presented - in which the feeling that goes towards external objects is expelled, purged, and defeated, which is the expelling action. In this, the internal feeling is filled - the feeling of the inner self is filled, which is the filling action, and that stable state of the inner self is the kumbhaka action. This feeling pranayama, which is the nature of the self, is desired in the spiritual path of yoga. "External feeling expelling here, filling internal feeling; kumbhaka stability by virtue, pranayama nature... Manmohan Jinji! Sweet is your word." - Shri Gadh D. Sajay 5. Pratyahara - withdrawing the senses from the objects of the senses is pratyahara. Not connecting the senses to the five objects of the senses is pratyahara. "The senses do not connect with the objects of the senses, that is pratyahara." - Shri Yoga Sajay 6. Dharana - "Rerayashchitt Dhana" (Pa. Che.) Holding the mind to a place is dharana. Holding the mind to a limited place, such as the contemplation of a certain element, is dharana. 7. Dhyana - "Tatra Prachaijatana Dhyana" In it, the unity of perception is dhyana. Dhyana is the cessation of the fluctuating thoughts of the mind. To contemplate the nature of the self with one-pointedness is dhyana. 8. Samadhi - To become the nature of the self, to attain the truth, to be absorbed in the truth is samadhi. Where there is no difference between the meditator, the meditation, and the object of meditation, all three become one, that is samadhi. "The meditator, meditation, and object of meditation are one, we will now cut the difference..." - Shri Yashovijayji - Eight Ashya Desha: When the mind, which is afflicted with the eight afflictions, abandons the evil intentions, then the corresponding vision is attained. When the first affliction is abandoned, the first vision of friendship is attained, and so on. It is essential for the soul, which is full of intellect, to remove these afflictions with all its efforts, because victory of the mind is necessary for the attainment of liberation, and these eight afflictions hinder that victory. When these afflictions are removed, the virtues manifest. Its concise form is as follows: 1. To become tired, to become tired while progressing on the auspicious path. When this affliction is removed, the vision of friendship is attained.

The Eight Obstacles to Right Conduct: A General Explanation:

**1. Aversion (Gaddvesha):**  Aversion is a state of weariness arising from eight types of aversion (85). This weariness leads to a lack of steadfastness in religious practices, which is essential for spiritual progress, just as water is essential for agriculture.  "Due to aversion, there is no steadfastness of mind in religious practices; the main purpose is to attain spiritual progress, just as water is essential for agriculture." - Shri Anandghanji

**2. Disinterest (Khed):** Disinterest is a mental aversion or dislike towards virtuous actions. It arises from a lack of understanding of the true nature of spiritual progress. This disinterest can manifest even when sitting still, causing agitation and restlessness. Due to this obstacle, even when performing actions, one rushes through them like a king's messenger, trying to finish them quickly. "Even when sitting still, disinterest arises in actions; due to aversion, one performs actions with the speed of a king's messenger." - Shri Yashovijayji

**3. Distractedness (Kshepa):** Distractedness is a state of mental agitation and instability. It involves the mind wandering from one action to another, causing a lack of focus and concentration. Just as repeatedly pulling up and replanting seedlings will not yield fruit, distracted actions will not produce pure results. "The mind wanders to other matters, this is distractedness; just as repeatedly pulling up and replanting seedlings will not yield fruit, such distracted actions will not produce pure results." - Shri Yashovijayji

**4. Apathy (Uthana):** Apathy is a state of disengagement from the path of spiritual progress. It involves the mind withdrawing from virtuous actions, leading to a lack of sustained effort. This arises from a lack of inner peace and tranquility.  The mind may abandon the action, but it cannot be truly relinquished due to attachment. This is the obstacle of apathy. "Due to a lack of inner peace, apathy arises; it is not truly relinquished due to attachment." - Shri Yashovijayji

**5. Delusion (Bhrānti):** Delusion is a state of mental confusion and misperception. It involves the mind wandering aimlessly, or mistaking the unreal for the real, like mistaking a shell for silver. This can lead to performing actions without understanding their true purpose, resulting in unintended consequences and hindering spiritual progress. "Delusion is like mistaking a shell for silver; it leads to performing actions without understanding their true purpose, resulting in unintended consequences and hindering spiritual progress." - Shri Yashovijayji 

Page #152:
---------------------------
(86) The one who does not understand the true nature of the soul due to the delusion of *gadsamurchay*, performs actions that are considered both done and undone. Such actions are contradictory to the true purpose of *shubh kiriya* and are like burning coals.  ...O Lord! 6. *Anyamud* - Finding joy in something other than the true nature of the soul.  It is like finding joy in something other than the true self, or ignoring the actions that have been started and finding joy in something else. This is like a shower of burning coals on the true purpose of the soul.  Ignoring the actions that have been started, finding joy in something else, knowing the true purpose of the soul, is like a shower of burning coals...O Lord! 7. *G* - Disease, *rag-dvesh-meh* (attachment, aversion, and delusion) are the three poisons that cause great suffering.  Or, performing actions without true understanding leads to the destruction of pure actions.  This creates a *g* that is painful and like a disease.  The fruit of such impure actions is barren.  Without understanding, with *rag* (attachment), pain and destruction are the result.  The destruction of pure actions leads to barren fruit...O Lord! 8. *Asang* - Attachment.  Attachment to external objects and influences, or becoming attached to a particular action due to its attractiveness, is *asang*.  The one who performs an action, becomes attached to it, thinking "this is beautiful," and gets stuck in it, becoming attached to it.  This is the *asang* fault, because the soul gets stuck in one place, unable to move forward, and progress is not made.  Therefore, the beautiful fruit of liberation is not attained.  Becoming attached to an action due to its attractiveness, getting stuck in one place, leads to the inability to attain the fruit...O Lord!  Thus, in the practice of the path of liberation, the mind initially experiences discouragement, fatigue, and lack of determination.  This leads to anxiety, aversion, and forced effort like a slave.  This causes mental disturbance, instability, and the mind wanders.  These eight faults cause the mind to wander from the task at hand, and it becomes restless, wandering in all directions.  As it wanders, it finds pleasure in something else, leading to *anyamud*.  This destroys pure actions, causing pain and destruction, making the actions weak, and leading to attachment to a particular place.  "I will only go to Dwarka!"  Thus, these eight faults can be understood in relation to each other.  As these faults are overcome, the eight virtues of the soul emerge and become manifest.

## Eight Obstacles: A General Statement

The eight obstacles are the eight qualities of an era (87). Or, in other words, in spiritual terminology, these obstacles can be reduced to:

1. **Kheda:** Lack of firmness in the practice of self-realization, leading to regret.
2. **Udveg:** Anxiety and aversion in the practice.
3. **Chittavikshep:** Distracted mind, leading to running after external objects and influences.
4. **Uththan:** Rising from the state of self-awareness.
5. **Branti:** Confusion and wandering in all directions due to external influences.
6. **Anyamudd:** Finding pleasure and enjoyment in these external influences.
7. **Tridosha:** The three poisons of attachment, aversion, and delusion, manifesting as a disease.
8. **Aanang-Aasakti:** Attachment and clinging to external objects and influences.

These obstacles can be explained in detail in this way. And these obstacles are interconnected and can be overcome in the following way:

1. **Dhrudhata:** Firmness of mind in religious practice, without regret.
2. **Udveg-Anugam:** No anxiety or aversion, no feeling of being stuck.
3. **Vikshep:** No distraction.
4. **Chitta Uththan:** The mind does not rise from the practice.
5. **Charo Kor Bham:** No wandering in all directions.
6. **Anand Prasang:** No occasion for pleasure in other places.
7. **Rag:** No attachment to the action.
8. **Aasakti-Aasang:** No attachment or clinging to any place.

## The Eight Qualities

1. **Ash:** Absence of aversion. The absence of hatred and envy towards the true self is the first quality. It is the first step on the path of righteousness, the first role. "The first role is the cause of service, fearlessness, and absence of aversion." "Aversion is the feeling of dislike." - Avadhoot Shri Anandghanji. Thus, aversion towards the true self is "Shresh," and the absence of this aversion is "Ash." This is a negative quality. When it arises, then...
2. **Jijnaasa:** An inner desire, eagerness, longing, and yearning to know the true self. Then...
3. **Shushrasha:** A strong desire to listen to the true self. Then...
4. **Shravan:** The ability to listen to the true self. Then...
5. **Badh:** Understanding the true self, receiving the teachings, and being convinced. Then...
6. **Mimaansa:** Deep contemplation, reflection, and analysis of the knowledge received. Subtle discrimination between what is to be abandoned and what is to be adopted arises. Then...
7. **Pratipatti:** Deep acceptance and assimilation of the true self. The true self becomes a firm belief in the heart, and experience arises. Then...

(88) Yoga-drishti-samuccaya 8. Activity - Activity in the form of Tattva, Activity in the form of Tad, Conduct, Observance, Character, and Delight. The soul delights in its own form. "By nature, activity is complete." - Shri Gadh Sakzaya "That stable nature, it produces, the name character, it is without gender...the original path." - Shrimad Rajchandraji Thus, these eight qualities are progressively less, and they are manifested one by one in the eight drishtis. Summary: Dehara: (8 Yogaanga) - Yogaanga - Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama; Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi - thus. (8 Dosha) - Dosha - Khed, Udvega, Kshepa, Utthana; Bhrānti, Anyamud, Reg, Asanga - thus. (8 Guna) - Advesha, Jijnasa, Shushresha, Shravana, Bedha; Mimansa, Pratipatti, Pravritti, Guna - thus. (8 Drishti) - Mitra, Tara, Bala, Deeka, Sthira, Kanta, Prabha, Para - thus. In the first drishti, the first anga is Yama; in the first drishti, the first guna is Tyaga. In the eight drishtis, there are eight angas in order; eight doshas are to be avoided, and eight gunas are to be cultivated. Now, to explain the meaning of the word "drishti", it is said - सच्छ्रद्धासंगतो बोधो दृष्टिरित्यभिधीयते  /  असत्प्रवृत्तिव्याघातात्सत्प्रवृत्तिपदावहः  //  17  //  Vritti: - Sadruddhavantto Godha - Sat Shraddhasangata Bodha. From this, Asat Shraddha is called Vyavachched - exception. And here, Asat Shraddha means that which is outside the scriptures, that which is based on the opinion of the father, and that which is a kind of Asad Uha-like alternative. From the alternative of such Asat Shraddha - from its absence - "Sat Shraddhasangata, that kind of Bodha - Avagama (understanding), what is it? It is - Drishtihittyamthiyar - "Drishti" is called - Darshan is Drishti, knowing this - Nishthyapay also, (because there is no Al or Avl in it). From the fruit, this is what is said.

The general statement of the eight yogadrishtis: The bodha (89) that is imbued with sat-shraddha is called "drishti"; it is the attainment of the sat-pravritti-pada through the cessation of asat-pravritti-baadha. 17. Meaning - The bodha that is in accordance with sat-shraddha is called "drishti". And it is the attainment of the sat-pravritti-pada through the cessation (stopping) of asat-pravritti. Here, the meaning of "drishti" is clearly explained. The bodha that is imbued with sat-shraddha is called "drishti". Here, "sat-shraddha" is specifically mentioned to exclude asat-shraddha. The shraddha that is based on asat-shastra, based on one's own sat-shraddha-based opinion, and that is based on the father's pure mind, is not "drishti". Asat-shraddha is the shraddha that is outside of shastra, where asat-tarka, vitarka, and vikalpa are used. Such asat-shraddha is not present in this "drishti". It is based on sat-shastra, is in accordance with shastra, and follows the agam-rupa ajna of the apt purusha. Such sat-shraddha - true shraddha - is present in it. Only such sat-shraddha is called "drishti". "Drishti" means darshan - to see. It is uninterrupted, there is no obstacle, therefore it is called "darshan" or "drishti". Whether it is slightly open or fully open, whatever is seen when it is open is "drishti". It is seen, it is seen, there is no obstacle. Darshan is thus "drishti", so saying "drishti" is "darshan" is true. To understand this properly, let's take the example of the eye, the charmachakshu - when the eye is closed, nothing is seen, then when the eye is slightly open, the nearby object is seen faintly, then when it is opened more, it is seen more, as the eye opens, more and more is seen, finally when the eye is fully open - asat-pravritti-chadhara-asat-pravritti-vyaaghatha (cessation). That is, due to such shraddha - shraddha-anta-pana - due to the cessation of shastra-viruddha-pravritti - cessation, what? That is, it brings about sat-pravritti-pavad - sat-pravritti-pada. That is, it brings about the pravritti-pada that is not against shastra. It means that it brings about the ghas-vidya-pada by abandoning the adya-sanvedya-pada. Although the sthira-adi-drishti is vedya-pada-rupa, it is also adesha due to its general lakshana-pana. Or, sat-pravritti-pada is the sheleshi-pada from paramartha. That is, there is no fault in the tat-pada-avah-pana of this drishti, in its attainment of that pada. 

Page #156:
---------------------------
The infinite sky can be seen with a small eye! Similarly, this inner eye, "gadashti", as it opens, unfolds, and expands, its field of vision increases, becoming wider and wider, and ultimately, with the opening of complete vision, infinite "darshan" is experienced. But whatever little or much is seen, it is all called "darshan" or "dashti"; there is only a difference of degree, not a difference in darshan. The nature of this darshan is one. Therefore, according to the sutra "rat pravachanam", the word "drishti" has been used in the singular. Thus, gadashti or darshan is one, but its divisions have been made according to the degree of its unfolding. When is this darshan or dashti said to be open? Its clear limit has been shown here: when there is faith in sat-shastra. Conversely, the knowledge that is without sat-shraddha, or the knowledge that is based on asat-shraddha, which is a mere imagination, cannot be called "dashti" or "darshan", because just as there is only blindness, not sight, not darshan, until the eye opens, similarly, until the inner vision opens, unfolds, and is free from the belief in sat-shastra, there is only dashti-andhpan, not sight, not darshan. This jiva is compared to a person with eye disease. A person with eye disease cannot open his eyes, he keeps them closed, and he does not even like the light. If an expert eye specialist treats him properly, applies collyrium, and gives him medicine, then gradually, there is a possibility of his eye disease being cured. Until he gets the right medicine from the right specialist, his disease will not be cured. Similarly, this jiva has been afflicted with a severe disease of dashti-andhpan, mithya-dashtipan. He has been lying with his eyes closed. He cannot even see the light of knowledge! Now, if he gets the right specialist, a sadguru, by the grace of great merit, and that sadguru diagnoses his disease properly and gives him the right treatment, applies the collyrium of knowledge, then gradually, the dashti-andh's vision will open, and ultimately, his eye disease will be completely cured. But the only condition here is that the sadguru, the specialist, must be found, and his medicine must be taken with firm faith, along with the proper diet and regimen. Only then will this great disease of atma-bhrant, the delusion of the self, be cured. This is how...

The general statement of the eight yogadrishtis: Divine vision (91) is not like the anger of self-awareness, the wise physician is the true guru; the guru's command is not like medicine, the thought is meditation.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi “अज्ञानतिमिरान्धानां ज्ञानांजनशलाकया  /  नेत्रमुन्मीलितं येन तस्मै सद्गुरवे नमः  // " The preaching ointment that the true guru applies, reveals the ultimate treasure; the heart's eye beholds the Lord of the world, whose glory is like Mount Meru.” – Shri Anandghanji has said that faith in the scriptures is the foundation of the path, and it implicitly includes faith in the original author of the scriptures, the As Purusha, as well as the true guru who explains the meaning of the scriptures. Because without a true guru, like a waking eye, who will explain the scriptures? The scriptures do not become self-explanatory! They are understood through the mouth of a knowledgeable true guru, who has opened the eyes of knowledge, and only then are they understood; without such a guru, the scriptures become inaccessible! Because “without the eye, the word is not understood”, “without the eye” – the guidance of the true guru, it is not understood; and that “divine eye” is revealed by serving the feet of the true guru. “Without the eye, it is not obtained, without the eye, the word is not understood; serve the feet of the true guru, then it is obtained directly. The thirst that is quenched, has a method of quenching; without the guru's understanding, it is not obtained, this is the eternal state.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji The ultimate eye makes the path, O Lord, the whole world is lost, with the eye, we go on the path, the eye is the divine thought. I have seen the path.” – Shri Anandghanji Thus, here the scripture writer has concluded with the principle of Arthapatti Nyaya – the first door to enter this yogadrishti is faith in the scriptures. The scriptures are the words of the As Purusha. To follow his command with faith is the first step on the path of yoga, it is the opening of the “vision”, otherwise it is blindness, therefore, the living being should abandon the free will of disbelief, abandon the free will of the mind's imagination, and follow the true scriptures – the command of the true guru, and with true faith, practice this path of yoga, this is the sound of the teaching. The living being who is free-willed, will surely attain liberation; those who have attained are infinite, the faultless Jina has spoken.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi 

Page #158:
---------------------------
(2) "The collection of virtues, like charity, austerity, conduct, vows, and the Lord, are essential. Without them, they become obstacles to liberation." - Shri Devchandraji. What is the fruit of such faith, or vision? It is said that: (1) It destroys wrong actions, (2) and thus leads to the attainment of right action. This is how: 1. Destruction of wrong actions - The faith that arises from the right understanding of the scriptures, then, in every possible way, leads to right action. That is, the wrong conduct, contrary to the scriptures, is destroyed - it ends, wrong action stops, wrong action ceases. Wrong action is so completely destroyed that it falls down, like a person who has been struck by a thunderbolt! It faints. Because this man of faith, who is an Asannabhavya (near liberation), wise, and endowed with faith, does not rely on anything other than the scriptures in matters of the afterlife. He considers the scriptures as the only authority, and thus cuts off wrong action. Because, "In this ocean of darkness, the light of the scriptures is the only guide to right action." And thus, wrong action stops, and therefore, this is all - 2. The attainment of right action - It is the one that brings about the attainment of right action. As wrong action ceases, the path of right action comes closer, it is drawn closer and closer. Here, "Avah" means "the one that brings about," and the word "Sapravrittipad" is very significant. The attraction of this Yogadristi is so powerful that it "draws the path closer and closer, and it is attained easily. It is as if a magical spell has been cast! Thus, this Gadristi draws the path closer! It attracts with an amazing power of attraction, like a magnet! Once this divine eye, in the form of Gadristi, touches, it is over! Here, Sapravrittipad means "the path that is perceived and experienced (Samyaktva)." This vision's "परलोकविधौ शास्त्रात् प्रायो नान्यदपेक्षते  /  आसन्नभव्यो मतिमान् श्रद्धाधनसमन्वितः  //  तस्मात्सदैव धर्मार्थी शास्त्रयत्नः प्रशस्यते  /  ચોદે મોહાપરેડમિન્નાટો: પ્રવર્તે છે ? -Maharshi Haribhadracharya's Shri Gabindu. 

Page #159:
---------------------------
The general statement of the eight yogadrishtis: Due to the power of the samvritti pad (93), the "asansvedya pad" (mithyatva) is abandoned and the "ghasavedya pad" is attained. Although the "vedyasansvedya pad" begins with the fifth stable drishti, there is no fault in stating this generally, as it applies to all drishttis. Or, if we consider it to be the sapravritti pad, which is the shileshi pad, there is no contradiction, because ultimately, its attainment is the satpravritti pad, which is the ultimate action. "Pad" refers to a stable, immovable place that never shifts. Thus, inevitably, under the influence of this "drishti," the attainment of the "vedyasansvedya pad" or the shileshi pad, which is an immovable place, occurs. Through the magical touch of this drishti, which is like a touchstone, this jiva, which is like a piece of lead, becomes pure gold! "Niyama kanchanata lahe re...man mohna re lal. Leh kyun paras pam re...bhavi behnare lal." - Shri Devchandraji. And to show that this drishti is of eight types due to the difference in the paristthul, and not just many different types, it is said: "Iyam chavaran apaya bhedad ashtvigha smrita / Samanyena visheshastu bhuyaansa sukshma bhedatah // 18 //" Meaning: Due to the difference in the awaran apaya, that is, the difference in the removal of the awaran, it is said to be of eight types generally. And in terms of specific differences, there are many, many subtle differences. The "drishti" used in the above discussion, which is singular, refers to the drishti with the characteristics mentioned earlier, which is due to the difference in the awaran apaya, that is, due to the difference in the removal of the awaran. Due to the difference in the paristthul, the purvacharyas have said that it is of eight types. Generally, without considering the subtle drishti, the specific differences of the sad drishti are many, many, due to the subtle differences, due to the infinite differences in darshan, etc., because their statement is based on the mutual position of the patitapana. 

Page #160:
---------------------------
(94) Due to the collection of *Gadasti*, eight types have been stated generally, and even that is stated with respect to very gross differences. For example, as the curtain in front of the eye is removed, more and more of the check is seen, and finally, when the entire curtain is removed, it is seen completely. Thus, with respect to the removal of the curtain, different aspects of the same vision-perception arise. In the same way, as the covering of *karma* nature is removed, according to the *upshama*, *kshayapashama*, *kshaya*, etc., the covering of *karma* is removed, the curtain is removed, and more and more clear and pure vision is seen, and finally, when the entire covering-curtain is removed, complete vision is seen. Thus, due to the difference in the removal of the covering, these eight gross differences of vision have arisen generally. But if we look closely with respect to *sufamabheda*, there are many, many special differences, infinite, which cannot be described. Because from *mitra* to *paradristi*, according to the *pashama* etc. of *karma*, the types of vision are infinite. The *shatrasthanapati* - *shagunananta* difference, the rule of loss and increase applies here. For example - (1) *anantabhagavrudhi*, (2) *asanкhyatabhagavrudhi*, (3) *sanкhyatabhagavrudhi*, (4) *sanкhyatgunavrudhi*, (5) *asanкhyatgunavrudhi*, (6) *anantagunavrudhi*. Similarly - *anantabhaghaani* etc. six types. Thus, if we assume even a single unit of vision in the smallest type of *mitra*, then according to this rule, there are infinite permutations and combinations of loss and increase, resulting in infinite differences. Thus, the number of *kega* locations is also countless. "In the *alpaviya* field, *pashama* is less, *avibhaga* is like a *vanarupa*; *vadaguna* is countless, thus the *rasthan* form is created... Our mind is captivated by the *prabhuguna*. From the *suhama* *nigadi* *jiva*, go, *sanni* *vara* *pajjatt* *re*; the locations of *yoga* are countless, immediately captivate the mind." - Shri Devchandraji Figure-4 0I | | | ' ' Covering is given. And here in *dristi samuccaya*... 

Page #161:
---------------------------
The general statement of the eight *dṛṣṭis*: *pratipāti*-*apratipāti* *dṛṣṭi*

The first four are *pratipāti*, the next four are not;
By *apāya* with *pratipāti*, these are also not others. 19

**Meaning:** The first four *dṛṣṭis* are *pratipāti* (liable to fall), the next four are not, and by their *pratipāti*, these first four *dṛṣṭis* are also *apāya* (liable to fall), the others are not.

**Discussion:**

Of these eight *dṛṣṭis* mentioned, the first four, like *mitrā*, are also *pratipāti*,
meaning they are liable to fall back. It is not that the first four are not *pratipāti*, but they are also liable to fall. And the next four *dṛṣṭis*, like *sthira*, are only *apratipāti*,
meaning they do not fall back after coming, they do not become corrupt, they remain stable. And the first four mentioned, if they happen to fall back, become corrupt, meaning that *dṛṣṭi* comes and then goes back, it is *apāya*, meaning it leads to *naraka* (hell) and other suffering, *bādhā* (obstacles), and *hāni* (loss).

**Commentary:**

*pratipāti-yuktā* - *pratipāti* yukt, *bhraṃśa* yukt (liable to fall back), *bāvāścharo* - the first four, *mitrā* etc., the first four *dṛṣṭis*. These are also of the same type, due to *karma* *vaicimnya*, they are also *pratipāti* yukt; but they are not only *pratipāti* yukt. Therefore, from the opposite meaning - *na uttarārūthā* - *uttara* means the next four *dṛṣṭis*, they are not like that. That is, *sthira* etc., the next four, are not *pratipāti* yukt (they do not fall). Because this is the case, therefore - *sāpāvā* *apāya* yukt also - for the purpose of *durgati* (bad destiny), *pratā* - it is these (the first four *dṛṣṭis*). How? Because - *atipan* - by *pratipāti*, by *bhraṃśa* (falling back); *netāḥ* - others are not like that, meaning *sthira* etc., the other *dṛṣṭis* are not *apāya* yukt.

**Doubt:**

Why are *śreṇika* etc., even though they are *apratipāti*, *apāya*?

**Resolution:**

Due to the power of the *karma* that arose in the absence of this *dṛṣṭi* (in the past). Therefore, by *pratipāti*, exceeding the possibility - expecting - it is said "also *sāpāya*". However, due to the special nature of *prāya* *vṛtti*, this is usually the case, therefore the *sūtra* has this explanation - arrangement.

Or, even though *sad* *dṛṣṭi* is not affected, it is also *apāya* and not *apāya*, because, like the weight of a ripe fruit, its intention, even in the possibility of suffering, has the potential for action (manifestation). *Yogācārya* is the authority here. (Just as a ripe fruit does not become unripe, so its mind - intention - does not produce suffering.) Therefore, it is established that the next four *dṛṣṭis* are not *apāya* yukt by *pratipāti*. 

Page #162:
---------------------------
(96)
The collection of Gadasti also arises. That which is not subject to Pratipat, does not fall after it has come, is not subject to the suffering of Naraka, etc. It is also not subject to Apay. Thus, in the first four Dasti, there are two alternatives - either it is subject to Pratipat or it is not subject to Pratipat; and if it is subject to Pratipat, it is subject to Apay and Apay; if it is not subject to Pratipat, it is Nir-Apay, free from Apay, free from the bondage of Naraka, etc.
Here, someone may ask - why did Shrenik Maharaj, despite being the owner of Kshayik Samyaktv, despite being in the stable form of A-Pratipat Dasti, suffer the suffering of Naraka, etc.? The answer is that in the absence of the present Dasti, he had previously performed Karma of doubt-resolution, and due to its Vipak, such a Samyakdasti Mahatma experienced the suffering of Naraka, etc. And thus, even if someone with stable Dasti, etc., experiences Apay, it is not due to Pratipat, but due to the Karma bound in the past, despite being A-Pratipat. Moreover, the Apay that is said to be absent here is absent in the sense of being absent in the general sense, so it is true that it may be present in some exceptional cases. But in any case, Pratipat is not present in stable Dasti, etc.
Or, if we look at it in another way, such Apay-bandha for great souls like Shrenik, etc., is An-Apay, it is not Apay, it is not bondage. Because when a weight is placed on a ripe fruit, it does not affect the fruit, it does not ripen; similarly, even though A-Pratipat is like the ripening of the body, it does not affect the mind of such a great person, it is Nir-Apay, it does not cause any suffering. Such an Avadhuta remains "always absorbed" in the state of absorption! Therefore, from the point of view of Paramarth, such Samyakdasti, equal-minded yogis, are not touched by any Apay, they remain like a lotus in water. Because they are beyond all Apay, beyond all bondage, they are "seated in the high state of self-awareness, which is indifferent," so the suffering of Apay cannot reach them.
Sukhi saheli hai, akeli udaseenata,
Adhyatma ni janani, te udaseenata, - Shrimad Rajchandraji
Sukha dukhrup karam phal jaane,
Nishchay ek aanando re, - Shri Anandghanji
Thus, it is proven that the Dasti which is not subject to Pratipat, does not fall after it has come, remains A-Pratipat, is free from Apay, free from harm and bondage, free from suffering, there is no question about it. This will be clear from the figure.

**"The journey is broken due to the absence of breaking, like sleep at night. The obstacle arises from the divine nature of the feet." (20)**

**Commentary:**

**Due to the absence of breaking the journey, the journey is continuous and uninterrupted towards the likes of Kanyakubja. This is like sleep at night. What? The obstacle, the restriction, arises from the divine nature of birth, which gives rise to the feet, the character, and the various types of compassionate feelings. This leads to activity again.**

**Just as when sleep is gone, the person going to Kanyakubja continues to journey, so too (when sleep is gone, he starts walking again).** 

Page #164:
---------------------------
## Yoga-drishti-samuccaya

**Thus:** Due to the absence of **praayan-bhang**, the **charan** of sleep at night, like a **charan**, arises from **divya-bhav** - due to the birth of a god.
(98)

## Commentary

And having attained **apratipaati** - a vision that does not fall, the journey towards liberation continues uninterruptedly, until liberation is attained. But if there are any remaining **karma-bhogavato**, then to experience them, perhaps one may have to take birth as a god or human, in the form of an **abhang** journey, in between. Thus, an obstacle in the form of **vidhat-vishrar** arises in **charitra**. But when that birth is completely experienced, the journey towards liberation continues.

Just as a man sets out to go to Kanauj, and on the way, he has to take four or more rests, spend the night, and due to these overnight stays, he also gets further away from his destination, and then in the morning, the journey resumes, and through these uninterrupted journeys, he finally reaches Kanauj; similarly, the **yagi** who is going to the city of liberation, with this stable vision of **apratipaati**, may have some remaining **karma-bhog**, then he may have to spend the night in the form of four or more births as a god or human; when that **kanauj** is overcome, the journey towards liberation resumes, and through this uninterrupted journey, he finally reaches the city of liberation, "**swaroop swadesh jaay ja**."

"**Jaashu swaroop swadesh re**" - **Mahatattva-jna** Shrimad Rajchandraji

"This is the true understanding (**samyak-tv** arises, after attaining **sthira-drishti**, the being may take birth, but that birth cannot stop him from going towards liberation; that birth does not give rise to the cycle of future births. Until true understanding arises, **samyak-drishti** is not attained, every birth becomes the cause of a new birth; infinite **anubandh** continue to happen. But when true understanding arises, this infinite **anubandh** is destroyed; and the previously generated **karma**, with **sadhya-drishti** of **sabhya-prakar**, are experienced, exhausted, the previously taken **karma-pudgal** is completely repaid, becoming free from its debt, one may have to take one, two, or at most fifteen births, but this does not stop liberation. He has already fallen on the path of liberation. When true understanding arises, the truth is known as truth, the falsehood is known as falsehood, he has got **line-clear**."

## Eight Yogadristi: A Summary

**General Statement:**
“In the four of creation, stability, etc., the journey of liberation does not break; just as the sun and moon shine, so too does the happiness of the liberated soul.”

**Summary:**
(9)
- The eight dristi are included in the three yags, namely, Iccha, Yaga, and Adhi, which were mentioned earlier. These eight dristi are: Mitra, Tara, Khala, Dipr, Stira, Kanta, Prabha, and Pa. They can be compared to the increasing brightness of a straw fire, a village fire, a wood fire, a lamp, a gem, a star, the sun, and the moon, respectively. The first four dristi are characterized by mithyatva (false belief), while the fifth dristi, Stira, marks the beginning of samyaktva (right belief).

Although the first four dristi, Mitra, etc., are characterized by mithyatva, they are considered sad-dristi (good dristi) because they are the cause of samyaktva. Just as sugarcane is essential for the production of pure sugar, the stages of Mitra, etc., are essential for the attainment of the pure soul and liberation. The Mitra, etc., dristi are like sugarcane because they provide the sweetness of the right belief.

In these eight dristi, the eight limbs of the fourfold path, namely, Cham-niyam, etc., are attained one by one. The eight types of citta-ashay dosha (mental and emotional defilements), namely, Udvega, etc., are abandoned one by one, leading to the attainment of these eight dristi. The eight virtues, namely, Advesha, Jijnasa, etc., manifest one by one in these eight dristi.

Here, the word "dristi" refers to a belief that is aligned with the truth and the teachings of the scriptures. It leads to the cessation of wrong actions and the manifestation of right actions.

The eight dristi are mentioned in this context from a gross perspective, considering the removal of the veils. However, from a subtle perspective, the stages of yaga are infinite.

The first four dristi, Mitra, etc., are prone to falling back into mithyatva. They can come and go, and if they do, they can lead to hell, etc. Thus, the first four dristi can be either pratipati (falling back) or apratipati (not falling back). There is a choice. However, the last four dristi, Stira, etc., are apratipati. Once they are attained, they do not fall back, and therefore, they do not lead to hell, etc.

After attaining the Yogadristi Samuccaya and such an unyielding, unwavering vision, the journey towards the city of liberation continues uninterrupted and unbroken.  Perhaps along the way, one may have to endure some suffering, requiring a temporary stay in the form of a few births as a noble deity or human, but ultimately, one will reach the city of liberation, returning to one's true home.

Gadasti Kalasha Kavya
  Mandakranta - in the midst of friends, the three worlds' companion receives the nectar of speed,
and with that strength, he illuminates, becoming steady like a star, holding love in his heart, what radiance he possesses,
with beauty, the moon, what coolness, gentle and peaceful. He attains the best, the most excellent vision, a friend like Jesus,
he may attain the sweet, delicious, intoxicating feeling of love; his purity becomes like refined sugar, pure and refined,
and he experiences the taste of nectar, eternal joy and bliss. Within the soul, the posture of Yama-Niyama is steady,
in Pranayama, he abandons the external form and cultivates the self; in Pratyahara, he firmly holds onto the self, with unwavering determination,
in Atmadhyana, he becomes one with the unchanging, complete God, attaining Samadhi. He abandons sorrow, his mind becomes firm, he abandons the agitation of Yoga,
he is not disturbed by distractions, delusion flees far away; he does not find any fault in other places, disease comes to an end,
and without attachments, he attains the state of being free from attachments, through progress. This is the first thing to hear, to know, the essence,
a good listener understands the essence through listening, and inquires about the essence with thought; he takes refuge in the essence with all his soul, with complete devotion,
he constantly engages in activity within it, becoming a seeker of the essence. The eyes of Yogadristi open, they seek the path of Yoga,
with faith, he becomes free, he sees the true knowledge with great understanding;

## The Special Feature of the Yogic Perspective 1. Mitra Keshti:

**‘Mitra’**

Now, each perspective, while explaining the process of Yoga, says:

“In Mitra, the vision is weak, Yama, Iccha, etc. are here; Akheda in Devakarya, etc., and Advesha elsewhere.” (21)

**Explanation:**

In the Mitra perspective, (1) the vision is weak, (2) Yama, Iccha, etc. are present, (3) Akheda (non-attachment) in Devakarya (divine work), etc., and (4) Advesha (non-hatred) elsewhere.

This is the main characteristic of this creation, which is truly reflected in all names.

**Analysis:**

Because of the Mitra-bhaava (friendly attitude) towards the world, the mind is free from hatred. This is why it is said, “Mitra ne satramuji veru melyu na melyu” (A friend does not get hatred).

**Vritti:**

Mitrayaam - in the Mitra perspective, Darshan melyu - the vision is weak, like the light of a firefly, a blade of grass, or a spark.

Cham - Yama, Ahimsa, etc. are the characteristics, and Iccha, etc. are the divisions. It is said, “Advittaana taiyatracharyaastraa: chanaa” - Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, and Aparigraha are the five Yamas (restraints). And the divisions of Yama are Iccha (desire), Pravritti (activity), Stha (state), and Siddhi (achievement), which will be explained later.

**Vena Revaacho:**

Devakaya, etc. - Akheda, the word ‘aada’ (etc.) includes Guru (teacher). In such situations, due to the satisfaction of such needs, there is no Khed (regret), but only activity. Just like in the case of headache, etc., there is activity in the form of seeking relief from the pain.

Advesha - and Advesha, Ansar, Gapatra tu - elsewhere, that is, in places other than Devakarya, etc., there is Advesha. Because, due to the ignorance of the truth, there is a feeling of ‘me’ and ‘mine’, but due to the non-arising of the seed of that feeling (because the seed does not sprout), there is a desire for the realization of the truth. Therefore, there is no worry elsewhere, and even in the presence of worry, there is a slight spark of compassion.

## Friend's Vision: The First Limb of Yoga - Yama

(193) The true nature of this vision is as follows: In this first vision called "Friend's Vision," the weak perception, bound by the weak faith, is like a straw fire. Just as a straw fire is unable to see the light of the desired object, this vision, bound by the limiting factor, cannot see the desired object of ultimate reality. Because just as a straw fire does not last long enough to perceive the light of the object, this vision does not remain stable long enough to practice the knowledge properly. Just as the light of a straw fire is weak and dim, this vision is also weak and has little power. Just as the light of a straw fire flickers and disappears, leaving no lasting memory, this vision, being short-lived and weak, does not leave a lasting impression. And just as a straw fire is completely flawed and incapable of performing any real work, this vision is also flawed and incomplete, and therefore cannot perform actions like bowing with devotion. It only performs actions like bowing to the material.

"On this occasion, I said, let us now speak of the first vision; where there is a friend, there is a weak perception, like a straw fire... brave..."
- Shri Yoga Darshan - 5

And this Friend's Vision is the first vision, which means that according to the previously mentioned rule, it achieves (1) the first limb of Yama, (2) the abandonment of the first fault called "Regret," and (3) the first virtue called "Non-hatred." It is as follows:

1. The first limb: Yama. The other name for Yama is Vrata (vow). There are five Vratas: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (continence), and Aparigraha (non-possession). Each of these Vratas has four types due to their varying intensity: Ichchhayam (desire-based), Pravrittiyam (action-based), Sthiriyam (stable), and Siddhiyam (perfected). (The nature of these will be explained by the great author at the end of this text.) A yogi who has the first vision must follow these Vratas of Ahimsa, etc., whether they are a small vow-taker or a great vow-taker. They must be truly non-violent, truthful, non-stealing, continent, and non-possessive. To understand the nature of these Vratas of Ahimsa, etc., it is essential to know their scriptural definition. Therefore, on this occasion, we will provide a brief explanation according to the first Patanjali Yoga Sutra: 

Page #170:
---------------------------
(104)
The action that is the cause of the separation of the soul from the body, which is the collection of the five senses, is violence. The absence of this is non-violence. Truthfulness of mind and speech is truth. Stealing the property of others is theft, the absence of which is non-stealing. Restraint of the senses is celibacy. Renunciation of possessions and attachments is non-possession, non-attachment. These five vows, being unlimited and undemarcated by direction, time, caste, etc., are universal and absolute, and are called "mahavrata".

How are these yamas considered limbs of yoga? Because violence, etc., are the opposite of the eight limbs of yoga, and these are restrained by the feeling of their opposites, non-violence, etc. That is, non-violence, etc., do not allow violence, etc., to arise, or if they arise, they destroy them. How is this restraint done by non-violence, etc.? Violence, etc., are restrained, so there is ease in attaining the materials of yoga, i.e., it produces a purity of mind that makes it easy to attain the materials of yoga. Thus, indirectly, there is restraint by non-violence, etc., but it is not directly a limb of yoga, like the direct benefit of concentration, etc.

These twenty-seven types of violence are: by body, by speech, by mind; done, caused, approved; and mild, moderate, and extreme - thus, by mutual combination, there are twenty-seven types of violence (3x3x3=27). By contemplating the infinite consequences of these twenty-seven types of violence, which are suffering and ignorance, the yamas of non-violence, etc., become superior, excellent, and refined. And the fruit of such refined non-violence, etc., is described as follows: In the presence of those who practice non-violence, there is an abandonment of hatred, and an abandonment of the killing of snakes, worms, etc., which are naturally hostile and born to kill. (Yoga Sutra 2.33, etc.). Thus, Patanjali has considered non-violence, etc., according to the Yoga Sutras.

x "Unlimited, universal, great vow" - Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2.3. + "Abandonment of violence" - Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2.33, etc. "Restraining the arguments by the feeling of their opposite." - Sri Yashvijayaji's commentary on the Yoga Sutras, 2.3. * "Truthfulness is the foundation of action and its fruits. Non-stealing is the foundation of the possession of all treasures. Celibacy is the foundation of the attainment of the highest state." - Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2.36-39. "Abandonment of hatred in the presence of him, and the fruit of his action is not done." - Sri Yashvijayaji's commentary on the Yoga Sutras, 2.25.

## Friend's Perspective: An Examination of Non-Violence

(105) Jain philosophy delves deeply into the subtle nuances of non-violence and defines it as follows:

(1) **Violence** is the taking of life through intentional action (motivated by passion).

(2) **False Speech** is the utterance of untruth, which includes:

* **Contradiction of Truth:** Denying the truth, concealing the truth, or presenting a false version of the truth.
* **Misinterpretation:** Saying one thing while meaning another.
* **Harsh Speech:** Words that are violent, cruel, or abusive, even if they are technically true.

(3) **Theft** is the taking of another's property, even something as small as a blade of grass, with the intention to steal.

(4) **Sexual Misconduct** is the violation of celibacy.

(5) **Attachment** is the clinging to external objects, whether animate or inanimate, through the mind. This is also known as "**Mūchchhā**" (obsession).

The **Vows** are the restraint of the mind, speech, and body from these five forms of violence, false speech, theft, sexual misconduct, and attachment. These vows can be practiced in two ways:

* **Aṇuvrata:** Restraint from specific actions.
* **Mahāvratā:** Restraint from all actions.

Each vow has five levels of intensity.

Those who practice these vows must be free from any form of violence, false speech, theft, sexual misconduct, and attachment, both in their own actions and in their encouragement of others. They must also be free from:

* **Mayaśalya:** Attachment to illusion.
* **Mithyātvashalya:** Attachment to falsehood.
* **Nidānaśalya:** Attachment to the cause of suffering.

They must be free from fear, desire, and prejudice, and must be impartial.

(This is why these vows are called **Samyaktvamūla**, meaning they are rooted in **Samyaktvā** (right conduct). It is only through right conduct that these vows can truly be fulfilled.)

To illustrate the depth of these definitions, let us examine the definition of non-violence:

**"Ghamattayogana Kālacharopam Hiṁsā!" - Tattvārthasūtra**

This means that violence is the taking of life through intentional action. This definition is all-encompassing.

**Pramatta** refers to being influenced by passion, hatred, or other forms of delusion. **Yoga** refers to the actions of the mind, speech, and body. **Prāṇa** refers to the life force, which can be either physical or mental.

The **five senses**, **breathing**, **mental strength**, **verbal strength**, **physical strength**, and **lifespan** are all considered **physical life force**. **Knowledge**, **insight**, **reflection**, and other qualities of the soul are considered **mental life force**.

Therefore, violence is the taking of another's physical or mental life force through the actions of the mind, speech, or body, motivated by delusion.

**Physical violence** is the taking of physical life force, while **mental violence** is the taking of mental life force. 

Page #172:
---------------------------
## Yogaṣṭi Samuccaya (106)

The key to this is in the hands of the soul. If the soul is harmed, destroyed, then it is all violence. If there is physical violence, but it is done with compassion, then it is not violence. If there is violence in the mind, whether there is physical violence or not, it is still violence. If there is no violence in the mind, whether there is physical violence or not, it is still non-violence. To be detached from one's true nature, to be corrupted, to be agitated, or to be affected by passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion, is the destruction of the soul or mental violence. Therefore, falsehood, theft, sexual misconduct, and greed are all causes of the soul's corruption, and therefore all these sins are part of violence. Conversely, to be in one's true nature, to not be detached from one's true nature, to not be affected by passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion, is non-violence, and truthfulness, etc., are its parts. In short, not allowing passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion to arise is non-violence, and their arising is violence.

**66**

"Truthful and generous, compassionate and righteous; compassion is not one without the sun's rays."

"I am the soul, violence arises from the mind, all sins are born from it; from that, the opposite, non-violence, the contemplation of its absence...mind." - Sa, Tr. Ga. St.

Thus, since the mind is the primary factor in all things, it is the main test for determining violence and non-violence. And from this, some points emerge: For a person who practices right conduct, violence does not arise simply from the taking of life, if they are free from passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion. But if there is a state of delusion, under the influence of passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion, then whether the being dies or not, violence still runs ahead. Because the soul, being deluded, first kills itself with its own mind, then whether or not it kills another being.

*

—Śrīmad Rājacandrajī Praṇīta Mākshamālā

**66**

"Because the soul's transformation is the cause of violence, all of it is that. False speech, etc., are only mentioned to teach the student. Because of the influence of passions, the taking of life, in the form of the physical body, is definitely violence."

xt

Maharṣi Śrī Amṛtacandracāryakṛta Puruṣārtha Siddhi Upayā

"Even for one who practices right conduct, violence does not arise simply from the taking of life, if they are free from passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion. But in a state of delusion, under the influence of passions like attachment, aversion, and delusion, whether the being dies or not, violence still runs ahead. Because the soul, being deluded, first kills itself with its own mind, then whether or not it kills another being." - Śrī Puruṣārtha Siddhi Upayā

---------------------------
## Friend's Perspective: Ahed-Advesha

(107) "It means that the one who commits violence first commits violence against himself, whether he commits it against others or not. Thus, continuous violence or resulting in violence is violence. Therefore, there is always life-preservation in the egg.

And to explain this philosophical form of violence and non-violence, three types have been mentioned - Heta Aहिंसा, Swaroop Aहिंसा, Anubandh Aहिंसा. To save the life of a living being, to take care of its safety, is the purpose of non-violence, therefore it is non-violence of Heta Aहिंसा. Not to kill a living being, not to take its life, is Swaroop Aहिंसा. Non-violence resulting from three types of Anubandh is Anubandh Aहिंसा. In it,

Heta Aहिंसा and Swaroop Aहिंसा give auspicious results without Anubandh (tradition), but due to strong ignorance, it is attached to violence. And the one who is devoid of form or is careful, performs the action with the power of knowledge and gives non-violence through Anubandh, meaning that the tradition of non-violence continues. That is why it is said - First knowledge, then compassion.

Heta Aहिंसा in the form of victory, the form of non-violence towards insects; the form of the fruit that results from it is the form of Anubandh...

"Manmohan Jinji! You have painted me with your colors." Heta-Swaroop Aहिंसा gives, auspicious fruit without Anubandh, it gives due to strong ignorance, Anubandh to violence.. Mind, devoid of form and the one who is, is careful in action;

Knowledge power gives non-violence, gives Anubandh to all. Mind" - Sa. 2. Ga. St. etc. In this way, the profound interpretation of non-violence etc. has been done in Jain philosophy. In it, the importance of feeling is paramount, and from it, many riddles arising about violence-non-violence etc. are easily solved. The special inquirer should refer to Shri Purushartha Siddhi Upay, Sadha Triso Gatha's Stotra, Tattvarth Sutra, Upadeshpad etc. places.

2. Ahed

The first defect of intention, called Khed, is avoided here, so there is Ahed. Not doing what you are doing is called Ahed. Here, this Ahed decreases in Devakarya, Gurukaaya, Dharmkarya etc. When any duty related to Sadev, Sadguru, or Saddharma comes up, this man with this perspective acts in that duty with indomitable enthusiasm, full joy, and extreme enthusiasm, and does not get tired while acting in it, he remains firmly engaged. Just as the one who enjoys the world - the one who lives in the created world 

Page #174:
---------------------------
(108)
Agadashtisamuccaya
The soul, who is the recipient of the cycle of birth and death, is burdened with sorrow and pain. It is engrossed in worldly pursuits like the objects of sense, etc. However, in this state of mind, the strong, unbreakable thread of the true religion has been attached, so the soul remains immersed in the Dharma Kaya.
“The first step is to have seven causes, fearlessness, non-hatred, and non-envy.”
“We get tired from the activity of envy, hatred is an unpleasant feeling.” - Shri Anandghanji
“The true color is that of wealth… in the desert, the other color is that of the kite. The qualities are like a well.”
“The color of Dharma does not digest… the body digests. The qualities of goodness do not disappear… the form and the creation disappear. The qualities…” - Shri Yashovijayji
“When the soul awakens, then it will be attached to… that color.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji
3. Non-hatred
Even though there is non-envy towards the gods, etc., there is non-hatred and non-jealousy towards those who are not gods, etc. That is, there is no hatred or jealousy towards those who are not involved in any other gods, gurus, or religions. There is a neutral attitude of indifference. However, there is still no true knowledge of the Self, so the seeds of jealousy and hatred have not been destroyed – they are still present. However, the sprouts and shoots of jealousy and anger do not sprout or rise, they remain dormant. Because here, the soul’s mind is engaged in virtuous conduct, taking refuge in the practice of the Self. It remains vigilant and busy in its own affairs. “I will take care of all, I will not be deceived by anyone.” Understanding this, it takes care of itself, so it does not have room for the worries of others. And if it does, it does not give rise to hatred, jealousy, intolerance, or contempt towards them, but rather a feeling of compassion arises: “Oh, this poor soul! It does not respect the honorable, so it will suffer endlessly.” This compassion arises in the form of a desire to cut off the suffering of others. Or, hatred is an unpleasant feeling, aversion, dislike. Non-hatred is the absence of such hatred, unpleasant feelings, and aversion towards the virtuous, the true religion, and honor, etc. This is a negative type of ‘quality’. It is not a small matter. This quality of non-hatred manifests here. And thus –
“The vows also manifest here, there is no fear in good deeds;
There is no hatred, and there is no envy, this quality resides in the body… hero.” - Shri Chag 0 Sajjay, 1-7 Verses
This is said to show the systematic way in which the world is created.

## Friend's View: Grasping the Seed

**(109)** He who is established in this view, takes up the seeds of yoga; the wise know that these are the infallible causes of liberation.

**Meaning:** One who is established in this view, takes up the seeds of yoga, which are the infallible causes of liberation. This is known by the wise.

**Commentary:**

"The seeds of yoga reside here" - Shri G. Daszai.

One who is established in this view, takes up the seeds of yoga, as mentioned below. These seeds are the infallible causes of liberation. Just as a tree grows from a seed and eventually bears fruit, here too, these seeds are taken up and planted in the mind, which develop into a tree of liberation and bear the fruit of liberation.

Just as a small banyan seed, when combined with the right soil, water, etc., grows into a vast banyan tree, so too, a small mango seed, when planted, grows into a large mango tree and bears sweet mangoes. Similarly, here too, these seeds are taken up, which, with the right emotions, water, etc., will eventually lead to liberation and bear the fruit of supreme bliss.

Thus, these seeds are "infallible" - they are not barren, but will surely bear the fruit of liberation.

"The seed grows into a tree, spreading endlessly, with the help of soil and water; my inner wealth is revealed, the Lord's assembly is manifested." - Shri Devchandraji

"The reader will say, 'I will hear it,' and it will bear fruit, it is true." - Shri Yashovijayji

By obtaining these seeds of yoga, the character of this person improves! His inner emotions change! The obstacles are removed and he becomes virtuous. The emotions that were previously obstacles, now, due to the power of these seeds,

**Interpretation:**

He - refers to the person who is established in this view.

Takes up - refers to the act of grasping or accepting.

Seeds of yoga - refers to the principles and practices of yoga that lead to liberation.

Infallible causes of liberation - refers to the fact that these seeds are guaranteed to lead to liberation if practiced correctly.

Wise - refers to those who have a deep understanding of yoga and its principles.

This verse emphasizes the importance of taking up the seeds of yoga and practicing them diligently in order to achieve liberation. It also highlights the fact that these seeds are not barren, but will surely bear the fruit of liberation if nurtured properly. 

Page #176:
---------------------------
(110)
The collection of "gadashti" becomes a means of achieving liberation. Because this "gini" has attained "dashti" and it is mildly open, it also has "sat shraddhasangat bodh" as per the characteristics of "dashti." Therefore, it has faith in the Purusha, the Sadguru, and the Shastra. It considers their commands as paramount and acts accordingly. It abandons evil actions, bringing it closer to the path of righteous actions.
"The strong master is recognized, the self becomes strong; the obstructive results are avoided, the liberating achievement is called...the world-saving Lord is prayed to."
-Shri Devchandraji, thus, through the repetition of this "gabija," this being is reborn! The wrong path becomes right! The reverse cycle becomes the right cycle. From this seed, it becomes a "dvija"! It takes birth in the form of "sanskar." And by consuming this "gabija" which is like a "tirtha" that guides, ultimately, this "jogijan" becomes liberated and attains the essence of the "tirtha" in the form of its fruit.
"The cyclical Dharma of the "tirtha," the essence of the fruit of the "tirtha"; whoever serves the "tirtha" receives, the inexhaustible treasure of joy...
The supreme Lord of Dharma." -Shri Anandghanji
Now, while explaining the "yogabija," it says -
"Jineshu kusalam chitta tannamaskaar ev cha | Pranamaadi cha sanshuddh yogabija manuttam || 23 ||"
Meaning - A mind that is benevolent towards the Jinas, a salutation to them, and pure prostrations, etc. - this is the supreme "gabija."
Explanation - A mind that is benevolent towards the Jinas, towards Bhagavan Arhata, a mind free from hatred, etc., and filled with love, etc. This is called the "maneyag" attitude. "Tannamasjar" - and a salutation to the Jinas, and a salutation motivated by various types of devotion. This is called the "vachanayog" attitude.
"Kamaari" and prostrations, etc. - those with the characteristics of five-fold prostrations, etc. The word "aady" includes "mandala-pradakshina," etc. "Sanchathu" - "sanshuddh" - this is said in contrast to "asanshuddh," because it is different from the general "asanshuddh" due to its ability to act according to its nature, and therefore, its "yogabija" nature is not diminished. (This is not a pure "pramaadi" seed). All this, in its entirety or individually, is a "chavinangabija," the cause of liberation-inducing practices, "anuttam" - the supreme - due to the importance of the subject. (That which is superior to nothing is "anuttam," the best.)

## Friend's Vision: Pure Devotion to the Lord

**Commentary**

"Jinavar Shuddha Pranama Re" - Shri Cheg॰ Sajjay

One who has conquered the internal enemies like attachment, aversion, pride, etc., is the Vitarag Jin Bhagvant, the supreme object of worship for the entire world. To have a pure, auspicious mind towards such a Jin Bhagvant, to hold inner love and devotion without even a trace of aversion or dislike, to perform devotional worship, service, and adoration with a joyful mind - this is the best seed of devotion. For example:

(111)
"Upasana Jin Charan Ni, Atishay Bhakti Sahit."
"Par Prem Pravah Khade Prabhu Se, Sab Aagam Bhed Suur Khase." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

"Rishav Jineshwar Pritam Mahara Re, Aer Na Chahun' Re Kat;
Rizayo Sahim Sang Na Parihar Re, Bhage Sadi Anant.
Chitt Prasange Re Pujan Fool Khyu?, Puja Akhadit Eh;
Kapat Rahit Thayi Atam Arpana Re, Anandghan Pad Rah." - Shri Anandghanji

"Ajit Jind Shu Pritdi, Mane Na Game Ha Bijaane Sang Ke;
Malati Fule Mohie, Kim Ese Ha Khaval Taru Bhrung Ke."

"Shri Shital Jin Letie, Kari Bhakte Chakkhun Chit Ha;
Tehasu' Keha Chhanu' Khyu, Jehne Sampya Tan Man Vitta Ha." - Shri Yashavijayji

"Priti Ananti Parthaki, Je Tade Te Jode Ae;
Param Purush Thi Ragta, Ekatvata Hai. Dakhi Gunageh....
,,
Rishav Jinu Shu' Pritdi." - Shri Devchandraji

And due to the inspiration of such a pure devotional mind, the salutations to the Jins, salutations to the virtuous, "Namo Arihantalu", "Namo Nibbal Mitraalu" - such spontaneous expressions of devotion are also indicative of devotion. And the physical acts of prostration, five-fold prostration, six-fold prostration, twelve-fold prostration, etc., which are indicative of devotional feelings, are all types of pure devotion. These are seeds of devotion because they are expressions and indications of inner devotion. These salutations, etc., are "pure" only then they are indicative of devotion. Impure ones have no place here, because they are merely a form of ordinary behavior, and they do not contribute to devotion. Thus, (1) a pure mind with auspicious devotional feelings towards the Jins, (2) salutations to them through words, (3) and pure prostrations, etc., through the body - these are the supreme, most excellent seeds of devotion. The reason for calling these the most important and excellent is that the object of this devotion, salutation, etc., is the Jin, who is the supreme, most important being in the entire universe. 

Page #178:
---------------------------
(112) The collection of Gadasti is an excellent person, a unique and supreme being in the world. Therefore, the devotion of an excellent man becomes an excellent seed, because it causes the practice of joining and connecting with the Supreme. “With love for excellent qualities, we obtain excellent deeds… Excellent qualities increase one’s own glory, illuminating the excellent abode… Qualities”—Shri Yashovijayji “Excellence increases with excellent company, along with infinite joy; with detachment, we connect with the passions, and attain liberation from the cycle of births and deaths.”— “The purpose of the Jina is equality, the nectar of equanimity; the Lord is the support for attainment, the rules proclaim this.”–Shri Devchandraji Thus, here in the path of yoga—the path of liberation—the Lord, the scriptural scholar, has given the first place to devotion to the Lord. To perform devotion to the Supreme Soul, the pure self-nature, who has manifested the Supreme Self, to the best of one’s ability, is the first step in the cure for disease, the best seed of the tree of liberation. One who performs devotion to the Lord with pure intention, is sure to attain the fruit of liberation. “Devotion to the Jina is the path to liberation, the unparalleled seed of auspicious happiness.”—Shri Devchandraji “Without devotion, there is no liberation, nor is there any individual without form.”–Shri Rupvijayji Because by worshipping the Lord, by chanting the Lord’s name, by remembering the Lord’s qualities, by praising the Lord, by singing the Lord’s character, by contemplating the Lord’s form, by meditating on the Lord, and by feeling oneness with the Lord, the devotee becomes aware of the Jina’s own self-nature. “The lion’s nature remains in the flock of sheep” A child forgets the form of its father, but when it sees the lion, it immediately becomes aware of its true nature. Similarly, when the devotee becomes absorbed in the Lord, his original pure innate self-nature is remembered. Therefore, truly, devotion and worship of the Lord with a selfless intention is devotion and worship of the father’s self-nature. Regarding this, the great souls have said: “In worldly affairs, the Lord is the Jina, in solitude, I am the Lord; understand this, it is the imprint of the Jina’s teachings. The Jina’s nature is one’s own nature, there is no difference, this is the goal, the scriptures have spoken of this auspiciousness.”—Shrimad Rajchandraji

**Friend's Perspective: Pure Devotion-Obedience**

(113) "Worship of the Jina is one's own worship."
"The saffron-colored one, the lion of his own path, behold him; become a devotee of the Lord, take care of your own strength." "Having seen the perfect one, filled with the essence of Samadhi,
The shining self-form of the timeless one is forgotten." - Shri Devchandraji

The Lord has manifested his pure self-form, and it remains as power for other beings. Therefore, the manifested, personal form of the Supreme Being is in the position of a model, an ideal. Just as a skilled sculptor creates his artwork based on a model, so too, a devotee skilled in the art of devotion keeps the Lord, the model, constantly before his eyes, striving to achieve the complete, perfect, and harmonious fulfillment of his own pure soul.

"Always keeping the Jinaraja as the model, the seeker feels;
Devchandra, Devchandra, experiencing his path, the pure soul's essence." - Shri Devchandraji

Devotees perform devotion to the Lord in many ways. Listening to the Lord, chanting his name, remembering him, serving his feet, offering worship, bowing down, serving him (as a servant), being a friend, and self-surrender - these are the nine types of devotion mentioned in other scriptures. In Jain scriptures, these are categorized into two main broad categories: material and emotional devotion.

Bowing down, prostrating, offering worship, praising his virtues, etc., are material devotion. The desire to become one with the Lord, selflessness in the service of others, the manifestation of the qualities of the soul, becoming like the Lord - these are emotional devotion. Material devotion arises from emotional devotion, therefore it is a necessary duty. Here, in the friend's perspective, material devotion is primarily emphasized.

"Material service, bowing down, prostrating, offering worship, and praising his virtues;
Emotional devotion is the desire to become one with him, selflessness in the service of others." - Shri Chandraprabha - Shri Devchandraji

The best way to worship the Lord is to obey his commands, that is the greatest worship. Obeying the Lord's commands is the best service.

* "The means of worship is always the practice of obedience. As per one's capacity, with discipline, it is fruitful." Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, non-attachment, knowledge, and faith - these are the eight virtues. - Shri Haribhadrasuti Ashtak

(114)
If a servant does not obey his master's orders and says that he is a servant who obeys orders, how is that possible? This is like the situation of a servant who says, "I am your servant, but I will not do what you say." A true servant stands ready to serve his master, always present in his service, and never disobeys his orders. Similarly, a true devotee is always ready to obey the Lord's commands; and through ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, asangata, guru bhakti, tapas, and jnana, he worships the Lord.
"Good service is done with good intentions, without any deceit;
Being present and obedient in service, one easily pleases the Lord." - Shri Devchandraji
Some ignorant people think that the service of the Lord is easy, simple, and effortless. "They think that just by offering a few flowers, a few coins, or a few offerings, the Lord is pleased! But the Lord is not so easily pleased, and his service is not so easy, simple, or effortless; it is very difficult. Because,
"Ignorant people consider service easy, but service is difficult and unique;
If a servant asks for something, he receives joy and wealth." - Shri Anandghanji
"The path to liberation is difficult, O Lord, but the path to liberation is easy, O Lord.
Abandon all attachments, then liberation is easy, O Lord.
Eliminate all karmas, then liberation is easy, O Lord.
Those who are absorbed in the Lord, and who serve him with devotion, find liberation easy, O Lord." - Shri Devchandraji
This devotion and worship of the Lord is the greatest thing, and therefore, the glory of devotion has been sung in all religions. The Gita says, "Of all yogis, he who is devoted to me, who dwells in me, who is full of faith, and who worships me with his heart, is the most dear to me." And the great Dharma scholar, Acharya Shriman Yashovijayji, has said, "I have studied the ocean of scriptures, and from it, I have found only this truth: devotion to the Lord is the seed of all happiness and wealth."
"Even the gods are not equal to a devotee,
A devotee is considered to be equal to me." - Gita
"The devotee who is devoted to the Lord,
He attains the highest happiness." - Shri Yashovijayji

**Friend's View:** The state of being a Tathābhāvyā in the last Pudgalāvartta.

**When this is, it is said to be the time for it.**

**In the last Pudgalāvartta, the ripening of Tathābhāvyatā; this is pure by rule, not at any other time, so say the knowers.**

**Meaning:** From the ripening of Tathābhāvyatā, in the last Pudgalāvartta, this (skillful citta) is pure by rule, not at any other time, so say the knowers.

**Commentary:**

(115)

The pure skillful citta, etc., the seed of devotion, which was mentioned above in relation to the Jina, arises when? The time for this is shown here. This pure citta, etc., is attained in the last Pudgalāvartta. It is like this:

When a being, through the process of taking and giving up, of acquiring and relinquishing, has come into contact with all the Pudgalas in the Lokas once, and they have been gathered together, then one Pudgalāvartta is said to have occurred. Pudgalāvartta means the revolution of the Pudgala cycle. Thus, in one Pudgalāvartta, countless births and deaths filled with endless suffering have occurred; and in this beginningless samsara, while revolving in different realms, according to the law of cyclical rotation, this being has passed through countless Pudgalāvarttas. It is said:

“That state which is not understood, but is understood to be attained, I bow to that state, O Shri Sadguru,
Endless suffering; O Bhagavan.” — Shrimad Rajchandra
Composed in Shri Ātmasiddhi

**Explanation:**

In the Dharma, Purūjāvata — the last Pudgalāvartta — means that there are Pudgalāvarttas (revolutions of Pudgalas) in that way, through the taking and giving up of the being. And “te cānāto saṁjñā tathāmanyatyāśritāḥ viviyante pi” — in this beginningless samsara, these Pudgalāvarttas, which are affected by Tathābhāvyatā, are different for different beings, according to this statement. In the word “charma,” the name “charmāvartta” is implied. Here also, the reason is given — “tathāmanyatva” — from the ripening of Tathābhāvyatā. That is, from the cessation of the bitterness of Mithyātva (the removal of bitterness), a little bit of faith is achieved, and therefore, this — the skillful citta, etc., towards the Jina — is pure by rule. “Niyamā” — by rule — in this way, through the ripening of karma, through Tathābhāvyatā; — not at any other time, as in the case of purity, because of the absence of impurity here. (That is, just as purity does not arise at other times, so here, in the charmāvartta, impurity does not arise; only purity remains.) That is why it is said — “nānyāvi” — not at any other time, before or after. Because before, there is the desire for defilement, and after, there is the desire for greater purity. “Kṛtti dvi” — so say the knowers, the knowers of the Dharma.

The collection of verses says, "Without your vision, I wandered, time endless and vast; subtle moments in the midst of existence, countless particles of matter* in the cycle of birth and death; I wandered without understanding, in a trivial and extreme existence." - Shri Devchandraji. "Thus, we know many lands... dear friend! Look! The clever ones do not climb up the hand, dear friend." - Shri Anandghanji.

Thus, as the particles of matter are constantly changing, and the ripeness of the state of being is achieved, some beings are left behind in the count. And among those who are left behind, the last one who turns around is called the ultimate particle of matter. And the reason for this last turning around is the ripeness of the state of being, the ripeness of the culmination of the various types of existence. That is, when the state of being ripens in the being, when the appropriate qualification and eligibility ripens, then the bitterness of the poison of false belief disappears and some sweetness of the taste of attainment is achieved. It has been said that -

" योग्यता चेह विज्ञेया बीजसिद्धयाद्यपेक्षया ।
અાત્મનઃ સજ્ઞા ત્રિા તથમવ્યમયતઃ !”—શ્રી ગબિન્દુ, ૨૭૮

Meaning - The inherent, small type of qualification of the soul, in relation to the attainment of the seed and so on, is called the state of being. The life, that type of qualification, is called the state of being.

Thus, when the last particle of matter turns around due to the ripeness of that qualification, the state of being, then the pure mind, etc., is attained towards the Jina, this is the rule. At no other time, before or after, is this pure mind, etc., present. Because before it, there is a confused intention, and after it, there is a more purified intention, so say the knowers of the scriptures. Without appropriate qualification and eligibility, no work can be done. Therefore, until the being has not attained that type of qualification, the state of being, the being cannot attain the virtues. The attainment of the excellent seeds of devotion to the Lord, etc., is not a trivial or small matter, but a matter of great fortune of the being. That fortune is attained by the being when it has its last birth, because then the state of being, the qualification of the being, ripens, so the amount of bitterness of the poison of false belief decreases, and some sweetness of the result arises, so that an unprecedented devotion to the Lord arises.

* " अनादिरेष संसारो नानागतिसमाश्रयः। પુત્ાાનાં પરાવર્તા બત્રાનમ્નાસ્તથા જતાઃ |–શ્રી ગબિન્દુ, ૭૪.

**Friend's View: Pure Characteristic**

(117) "The cycle of existence is the ultimate cause, and the culmination of existence is its ripeness. When the blemishes are removed and the vision is clear, then comes the attainment of the sermon and speech." - This is the statement of Shri Anandghanji Devchandra Prabhu, which is the result of virtuous devotion and inner experience, and through which the strength increases day by day. - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, with the desire to narrate this entire story, it is said:

**Verse 25**

"It is pure, devoid of any desire for fruit, and accompanied by the complete cessation of perception."

**Commentary:**

- It is pure because it is completely free from any attachment to the objects of perception, and it is devoid of any desire for fruit.

- The perception is completely ceased because it is free from the ten types of perception, which are: food perception, fear perception, sexual perception, attachment perception, anger perception, pride perception, deceit perception, greed perception, hatred perception, and worldly perception.

- The practice that is accompanied by such perception, although beautiful, leads to progress (accumulation of merit), but not to liberation (nirvana). This is because it lacks purity.

- Liberation arises from the intention of detachment from the cycle of existence, as the yogis say.

- It is devoid of any desire for fruit because it is free from the desire for any worldly fruit.

**Question:**

- If perception is completely ceased, then how is it possible to have any desire for fruit?

**Answer:**

- This is true in the context of the fruit of the cycle of existence. However, here, it is also referring to the fruit of the general characteristics of gods, etc., which are not related to the cycle of existence. This is because, due to the unwholesome nature of the desire, the fruit obtained from it is inherently prone to obstacles.

- This pure, skillful mind, devoid of any desire for fruit, is the means to liberation. However, due to its inherent nature of being free from obstacles, it is the one that brings about the state of liberation, just like the respect of Gautam Swami towards the Lord. This is because it is the producer and the facilitator.

- Just as a grain of rice will not sprout if it does not have a seed, so too, liberation will not be attained if there is no pure mind.

(118)
**Meaning of Yogadristi Saasuchchay:** This pure state is characterized by an extremely upadaya buddhi (a mind that is highly receptive to the teachings), the cessation of the distortion of perception (sanjna nidh), and the absence of desire for fruits (falabhisandhi).

**Explanation:** The pure state of mind, etc., mentioned above, is further clarified here. This pure state has three main characteristics: (1) extremely upadaya buddhi, (2) sanjna nidh, (3) absence of desire for fruits (nishkamapana).

1. **Param Upadaya Buddhi:** Firstly, there should be an extremely upadaya buddhi towards the Lord. This means that Shri Jinendra Dev, the liberated soul, is more worthy of respect, acceptance, and worship than anyone else in the entire world. One should develop this supreme upadaya buddhi, recognizing that His virtues and glory are infinitely greater than the entire universe. He should be the supreme guide (Jagadguru), the supreme being (Parameshthi), and the supreme beloved (Param Ishta). One should express the utmost respect towards Him. This upadaya buddhi, this supreme respect, is manifested in its highest form here, because this state is the precursor, the initial stage of Samyagjnana (right knowledge), due to the ripeness of such qualities. Therefore, the devotee, the yogi, who possesses this vision, sees the Lord as the most beloved, the most dear, the most cherished.

"My beloved is the incomparable Jinendra, I desire nothing else. I will not bring any other deity into my mind's temple, that is my way." - Shri Anandghanji

"The Lord of the three worlds, the self-existent, the worthy of worship." - Shri Devchandraji

"What have I gained from the virtues of Sumatinath? My heart is filled with joy. Like a drop of oil spreads beautifully in water..." - Shri Yashovijayji

However, this skillful mind, etc., devoid of desire for fruits, is also characterized by the ability to overcome obstacles (abhinagranthi) due to the power of complete activation (charma yathapravrittikaran) and the ability to overcome suffering (kshapashamsar). This is like the selfless state of a non-distracted ascetic (apramat yati) - as the yogacharyas have said:

"The seed of yoga in the mind of one who is submerged in the ocean of existence is the part that emerges from the water. It is the cause of the weakening of attachment (sakta) and the first aversion to the world (prakriti). It is the cause of the awakening of the mind (samujjasana). It is the cause of the destruction of the mountain of obstacles (granthi parvat) by the unbreakable rule (niyama). It is the cause of the destruction of the obstacles (granthi) by the power of the mind (bhavacarakapalayan). It is the cause of the removal of the obstacles (apasar)."

And so on, in brief. (For meaning, see explanation).

This skillful mind, etc., towards the Jina, is like the beginning of the ripening of the fruit (falpak). It is a natural state (svabhavapana) that arises from the time (kal) and other factors. (It is like the beginning of the ripening of the fruit).

## Friend's View: Ten Sign Restraint

(119) Leaving aside all other tasks, considering devotion to the Lord as the most worthy of respect, having the wisdom to be absorbed in devotion to the Lord with pure intention, this is called *upadeya buddhi*. In the heart of a true devotee, devotion to the Lord holds the highest place above all other actions, such supreme *upadeya buddhi* manifests.
“With pure intention, steadfastly take up the Lord, who is the one you call upon; you will attain the boundless infinite, the supreme nectar-like abode...cool.” – Shri Devchandraji

2. Sign Treasure
The second characteristic of purity is that it should have the absence of the rise and fall of ten types of signs. These ten signs are: *aharasangna*, *bhayasangna*, *mithunasangna*, *parigrahasangna*, *krodhasangna*, *manasangna*, *mayasangna*, *lebhasangna*, *ghasangna*, and *lekasangna*. If none of these signs arise in devotion and other actions, then that devotion, etc., is considered pure. The feeling of avoiding these signs is as follows:

*Aharsangna* - In devotion, such absorption, such immersion occurs that even food, etc., is forgotten, there is no awareness of eating and drinking, such a frenzy of devotion to the Lord is felt by this devotee-ascetic.
“I chant their name, like a *chatak* bird, thirsty for rain.” – Shri Yashovijayji

*Bhayasangna* - In devotion, that fear itself becomes fearful, it flees! It runs away from afar! Then, what fear for the devotee-king who has taken refuge in the supremely fearless feet of the supremely powerful Supreme Being? Because –
“Pain and suffering are dispelled by the body, what is the benefit of happiness and wealth? “Who is the one who has placed a burden on the head of the Lord? Who is the one who is equal to the elephant? You are the powerful Lord, the pure *Vimlajina*, you are generous to sinners, you are the one who brings peace to the mind, you are the support of the soul...*Vimlajina*.” “The great fear of the world is dispelled, by the seventh *Jina* Lord.” – Shri Anandghanji
“Let us obtain the fearless state, let us remain steadfast in his service.” – Shri Devchandraji
“*Mitamya nirita matthapam*” – Shri Kalyanamandir Stotra.
“*Tasthashu naramupati march ma*” – Shri Bhaktamar Stotra.

*Mithunasangna* - That person will not experience the rise of trivial lustful desires at that time. Because, the remembrance of the selfless Supreme Being is also the destroyer of lust. Therefore, that virtuous man will not even remember lust.

Parigrahas'jna—The fainting of attachment, the ego-consciousness of considering the external object as one's own, is removed here, because attachment to the Lord cannot be joined without attachment to the external object—to the pudgala, etc. And the true devotee prays to the Lord without ceasing, saying, "O Most Merciful God! Deliver me from this traditional attachment! Deliver me from this web of external objects!" For such a person, what is the use of attachment in the path of devotion?
66
‘Deliver me from this traditional color, O my Lord!....O Merciful Lord! ”

Attachment is born from the external, he who clings to it, joins with it....Rishabha. Shri Devchandraji Krodhas'jna—Anger does not arise here. Because anger and devotion, which is immersion in the supreme peaceful state of mind, do not go together. By seeing the Supreme Soul, who is immersed in the nectar of peace, anger is extinguished, and the soul is immersed in the nectar of peace.
“Having created a form that is beyond comparison, no comparison can be made;
Immersed in peaceful state of mind, the king does not see it....Vimala”—Shri Anandghanaji Upshamarsabhari, Sajans'kari, Smriti Jinrajni Aaj Bheti.”—Shri Devchandraji Manas'jna—The desire for worldly honor, respect, fame, worship, etc., does not diminish here in pure devotion, etc.... If it is done with the desire to be honored and worshipped in the world, or if one has the evil pride of "I am doing such devotion," then it makes the Chintamani gem like a worthless coin! Because it makes the precious, excellent devotion secondary, and runs after the lowly, insignificant honor of the world; that is, it openly insults the supreme importance of devotion, etc., and makes it a laughingstock. But the true devotee does devotion to the Lord, etc., only for the sake of his own spiritual welfare.
66
‘The form of the mind is not small, the vow is taken with pride;
Do not take the Supreme Soul, take worldly honor.”—Shri Atmasiddhi
Mayas'jna—There is no deceit in pure devotion, there is no cunning-deceit like the hypocritical devotee, there is no hypocrisy, there is no pretense of religion as a cover-up for one's own faults.

## Mitraapti: Ten Sarjnaa Niraadh (121)

There should be no hypocrisy, deceit, or trickery, no self-praising or criticizing others, no "rosaries in hand, but lust in the mind" attitude, no tricks to deceive the world with false appearances. True devotees, with pure hearts, sincere and simple, with pure intentions, and without any deceit, should have a feeling of self-surrender to the Lord's feet. They should act accordingly.

"Covering up faults is a sin, performing actions according to the Jina's teachings is the right thing to do! I am not a person of faults, I am the beloved of the eternal one!..." - Shri Devchandraji

"Become free from deceit and surrender yourself, then you will attain the abode of bliss." - Shri Anandghanji

**77**

* As long as there is another feeling in the mind, it is futile and deceitful to show that you have no other feeling than the Lord. And as long as there is deceit, how can the soul merge with the Lord's feet? Therefore, by stopping all worldly feelings and making the mind pure and conscious, it becomes pure because there are no other feelings left in it, and it becomes sincere. Such a conscious mind, when merged with the Lord, is called self-mergence. ... The one who is himself merged in another place, how can his other material things, which have become his own, be surrendered to the Lord? Therefore, the merging of the mind in the Lord is the self-mergence. - Shrimad Rajchandra Patraank, 692 (753)

**66**

"How can the Lord be pleased with you? Your heart's deceit does not go away." - Shri Narasimha Mehta

**Laalsajna** - The desire for worldly benefits from devotion, greed, and impure practices should not be present. Because if one desires such trivial, momentary, and perishable flowers, they will lose the infinite fruit, they will sell the wish-fulfilling gem and buy pebbles! This is not devotion, but a contract! But true devotees do not have any such greed, they perform their duties of devotion, etc., without any attachment, without any hope of reward. Devotion is not a contract, it is service that does not seek reward. - Shri Devchandraji

**Eghasajna** - There should be no herd mentality, following the general flow of the common people, no blind following, no blind faith like the blind leading the blind; but there should be true devotion with understanding of the truth.

"With pure taste for the truth, perform devotion to the Lord Jina." - Shri Devchandraji

**Laaksajna** - To perform actions for the sake of pleasing others, for the sake of gaining praise and worship, is...

Lokasangna is there. Such Lokas'gna-àkeshana in this pure devotion etc. does not decrease. Because Lokeshana in the form of Lokapakti * and Lokottara such Atmakalyan never gets a chance to meet it. If the soul is desired, then the mind should be abandoned, and if the mind is desired, then the soul should be abandoned. Just as a sword does not fit in a sheath, how can barking and biting? Just as both actions are together and not, so the soul and the mind never meet. And if we think about the Supreme, the value of the people near the soul is not even that of an almond. Similarly, wood is also difficult to please - it is difficult to please. The one who once showers flowers of praise, he himself strikes with the whip of censure! Therefore, if one wants to please the Lord, one should give up the attempt to please the people, one should give up the worship of the Lokottara God with worldly feelings. Understanding this, the Chaugipurusha does not even touch Lokas'gna.

The world was shown the rough and an attempt was made; therefore, it did not become rough. Because the rotation and the purpose of the rotation are still directly present. If one life is spent in making the soul rough, then the infinite lives will remain; I understand this in a trivial way,”—Mahatattvagna Shrimad Rajchandraji
Thus, when these ten types of sangna are suppressed, then only pure devotion etc. is considered. Otherwise, even though that practice is beautiful, even though it gives merit-progress-like divine etc. motion, it does not become the cause of liberation, because there is a lack of purification. The attainment of liberation arises from pure intention, which is indifferent to worldly things, say the Chaugijanas. And that is why, where even eating and drinking is forgotten, fear disappears, lust becomes useless, affection dies. Anger subsides, pride does not remain, deceit does not work, greed does not

## Friend's View: Detached Devotion
(123)

This pure devotion, free from blind faith, with true understanding, and without any concern for worldly praise or social norms, is what the truly detached yogis, those who have overcome the passions, perform. "When Shri Shital Jin is met, the devotee's mind becomes pure." - Shri Yashovijayji

3. Detachment is the third characteristic of purity. Pure practice is devoid of desire for results, free from the desire for devotion, etc., and is selfless. This is considered pure. In the above, the knowledge of the self is mentioned, and in the absence of the desire for the self, there is no desire for results. Why then is this separate attainment considered? The answer is that what was said before was said in expectation of the results related to this life, and what is being said now is said in expectation of the results related to the next life. That is, in the next life, I will attain the state of a common god, etc., due to the influence of this devotion, etc. - this desire for results related to the next life, is not the cause or the effect. This is called pure devotion, etc. If there is a desire for results, it is not considered pure. Because such desire is not good, so the result obtained from it is also not good, and it becomes an obstacle to the attainment of liberation. Any practice, including devotion, that is selfless, without any desire for results, is the means to liberation.

But if there is self-restriction, that is, if there is restriction in the pure mind, etc., towards the Lord, then attachment is maintained there, then the pure mind, etc., becomes the cause of staying in that state, it stops there, it does not allow the soul to progress. Here is a famous example from Shri Gautam Swami. He had a very pure mind, respect, and strong attachment towards Lord Mahavira. But that attachment became an obstacle to his liberation! Until that attachment went away, he did not attain omniscience. As soon as that attachment went away, he attained omniscience. From this, the essence is to be understood that it is not enough to stop at just strong attachment towards the Lord, but to constantly focus on serving the detached and attaining detachment.

"What was detachment, that pure state without attachment, is the same that removes the fear of rebirth." - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, such selfless devotion, etc., practice becomes the means to liberation. Because from a seed that does not have the essence of the grain, a sprout of the grain will never grow; and the grain
- " प्रतिबन्ध कनिष्ठं तु स्वतः सुन्दरमप्यदः ।
तस्थारिતિवाचैत्र वीरे पौतमकावत्त છે ”—Shri Yashovijayji's Dvadvadvaan

Just as a seed cannot remain without sprouting, similarly, a disease cannot sprout without a seed, and a seed cannot remain without sprouting.
The main intention of the wise is that the defects of the soul, such as svacchedadadi, are easily destroyed by the state of devotion. If even a little selfless devotion arises in the soul, it is enough to remove many defects.
–Shrimad Rajchandraji
He who is completely filled with self-knowledge and who is completely disgusted with the fruits of karma, finds peace in this world while sitting at home. But Arjuna, those who are worldly are bound by karma and are tied to the nail of fruit-gathering by the knot of desire. + x x They keep the desire for heaven in their minds, they forget the God of yajna-bhakti. Just as fire is brought into a pile of camphor, or poison is mixed into sweets, or by divine grace, a pot of nectar is obtained and kicked over, so they destroy the dharma obtained for the purpose of obtaining fruits. - Shri Jnaneeshwari Gita.
Thus, in this pure devotion, (1) there is supreme knowledge about the Supreme Being, (2) the rise of consciousness, (3) and selflessness. And such pure skillful mind etc. is here
In the last verse, even though the knot has not yet been broken, it is there, because of the power of pure devotion or the last yathapravrittikaran - the influence of such a type
There is a kshapsham. Just as the desire for the unpracticed self-controlled person decreases, so here, even without the breaking of the knot, pure devotion decreases, the skillful mind etc. with the seed of yoga - decreases, and therefore, in this friend's vision, the devoted person, with unique devotion, with great devotion, worships Shri Jinendra Bhagwan selflessly. Worship of the feet of Jin, with great devotion. - Shrimad Rajchandraji
What is the seed-like mind, the mind that has a seed? The four acharyas have said about it - (1) It is a little bit of enjoyment for those who are submerged in the ocean of the world, a little effort to come up to the surface, and this enjoyment is the world's + "Yu: karun chava sari maneti naichhiki
There is a belief that it has become, then it is necessary" - Gita, A. P.

**Gabbij Chitt**

(125) It loosens and weakens excessive attachment, it breaks it down. Just as someone who has drowned in the ocean comes up to the surface, they experience a clear difference between the state of being submerged and the state of being above, they feel relief, and the grip of their attachment to the submerged state loosens. Similarly, when a soul that is drowned in the ocean of samsara (worldly existence) attains Gabbij, it experiences a sense of relief, as if it has risen to a higher state, and its attachment to worldly things becomes weak, loose, and slack.

(2) This Gabbij Chitt is the first unpleasant sight of the nature (of the soul). When Gabbij is attained, the first unpleasant sight of nature - the web of Maya - the world - occurs. What seemed sweet before now begins to taste bitter, acrid, and unpleasant. Just as a man who has drowned in the sea has no awareness of his surroundings until he is rescued and comes to the surface, so too here, the soul, while submerged in the ocean of samsara, has no awareness of its situation. But when it attains Gabbij and rises slightly to the surface of the ocean of samsara, it begins to see the nature of the world - the bitter fruit of its own karma - and it is repelled by it. This sight causes it to fall into contemplation and wonder, "What is this strange and wonderful world?" Thus, its thinking faculty awakens.

(3) After Gabbij Chitt, it takes refuge in the means of knowing and understanding the world completely. Having drunk the salty water of the ocean of samsara with gusto, it now finds it bitter and poisonous. It wonders how this world can be sustained and seeks a solution. It delves into the depths of philosophical contemplation. It is inspired to see the deep cave of philosophy. It asks, "Who am I? Where did I come from? What is my true nature? What am I attached to? Should I keep it or abandon it?" By contemplating and analyzing these questions with a calm mind, it experiences the principles and essence of spiritual knowledge.

(4) Thus, the Gabbij Chitt becomes like a heavy weight against the mountain of attachment, aversion, and delusion, and it systematically breaks through and destroys this mountain of attachment. In this way, it attains Right Vision.

**Explanation:**

* **Gabbij Chitt:** A state of mind characterized by a loosening of attachment to worldly things.
* **Samsara:** The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
* **Maya:** The illusion that obscures the true nature of reality.
* **Karma:** The law of cause and effect.
* **Right Vision:** The correct understanding of the nature of reality.

The collection of Gadashti, the great path, is eternal, it is said,
Pure, unblemished, its nature is itself, it is said,
The essence of purity, the meditation, which one cherishes, it is said,
That is the state of equanimity, the master's seal, it is said... Seen by the wise, the state of Samadhi, it is said.— Muni Shri Devchandraji “Seeing the Jina, there is no doubt,
The sun spreads, darkness is dispelled... Pure Jina, my mind, your lotus feet,
Taking the nectar of virtues, the poor consider the earth a palace,
Indra, Chandra, Nagendra... Pure Jina”—Chougiraj Anandghanji Such pure self-realization happens here.
(5) And then that clouded mind, the prison of the form of existence, becomes the ‘bell of time’ for escape. Having attained right vision, then understand that the bell of destruction has rung, which removes the prison of the form of existence, the bondage, understand that the world has become like this, because –
“Thirst does not come, that is the death of life,
The vision that seizes,
Vision is rare, easily available through grace,
Anandghan Maharaj.”
You will break my heart,
The auspicious sound will ring;
The life will increase immensely,
Anandghan, the essence of joy.”—Shri Anandghanji “The self dwells in the self,
The auspicious garland in its own home... Dayalray!” –Shri Devchandraji
Such a pure clouded mind begins to culminate here. Because such types of time-achievements, etc., are ripe, therefore, due to its nature, this pure mind is like the beginning of the ripening of the first fruit. Just as the mango fruit begins to ripen when it is ripe in time, so here, in the last pudgalavarta, the fruit of liberation begins to ripen.
“Having obtained time-achievement, we will see the path,
That hope, that is the life of that person, Jina!
Know, Anandghan, the mango... on the path.”
–Shri Anandghanji Such time-achievement begins to ripen here, so the mango of Anandghanmat is now close to ripening the fruit of liberation. Whatever that time-achievement is, but the devotee sings in the fervor of devotion that –

Friend's View: Devotion to the Worthy, Beginning with the Acharya

“The knowledge of time is mine, the knowledge of feelings is yours;
Even a young elephant, though it is weak, roars with the strong elephant.” - Shri Yashovijayji

And this is not just the seed of devotion, therefore it is said to cultivate something else -

“Even in the Acharyas and others, those who are pure in their feelings,
Especially in the case of Vyayavratya, with pure intention.” 26.

(127)

Meaning: Even towards the Acharyas and others who are pure in their feelings, this same pure mind, etc., is the seed of devotion. Similarly, with a pure intention, Vyayavratya (service) towards them, according to the rules, is the seed of devotion.

Commentary:

“Service with feeling” - Shri Chag. 40

Even towards the feeling-Acharya, feeling-Upadhyaya, feeling-Sadhu, feeling-Tapasvi, etc., this pure mind, etc., which is full of auspicious feelings, devotional feelings, is the seed of devotion. Here, special emphasis is placed on the word “feeling”. Those whose souls have been filled with devotion through feeling - through the ultimate goal, who are true self-knowers, who are true gurus, who have the qualities of devotion, as taught by the scriptures, in the Acharyas and others, are the ones who deserve to be worshipped - not those who merely wear the outward form.

Even towards the Acharyas and others, towards the Acharyas, Upadhyayas, Tapasvis, etc., this same pure mind, etc., is the seed of devotion. What kind of special (with special qualities) Acharyas and others are they towards? They are towards those who are pure in their feelings - not towards those who are of low birth. Because even in the form of a foot, there is a definite ugliness of the unrefined mind. Therefore, (it is not right to respect the ugly).

This is not just the seed of devotion, then what is it? - Vyayavratya. And Vyayavratya, the feeling of Vyayavratya, which is its characteristic, - Vyayavratya (service), - by doing things like taking food, etc., according to the rules - according to the rules mentioned in the scriptures - with respect to the person, etc., is the seed of devotion. It is said:

“Towards the feeling-Acharya, etc.,
Devotion

“The person, knowing his own benefit and the benefit of his soul, should serve him, remaining without any hope of reward.” - etc.

Therefore, it is said - “with pure intention” - with a pure mind, with a pure intention.

Yoga-jissuchchay

Those who practice, who are adorned with the name and form of Dravya-achaya, Dravya-upaadhyaaya, Dravya-sadhu, Dravya-tapasvi, etc., and who have devotion for Bhava-achaya, etc., are the true seeds of yoga, not those who are Dravya-achaya, etc. Dravya-achaya - Dravya-sadhu, etc., are like counterfeit rupees, believing in them is like believing a fake rupee to be real, and it is not real. Therefore, only Bhava-achaya, etc., are valid. Those who are of the external vision, the natural people, they see the external form, etc., and consider it to be sainthood, they are deluded by the superficial appearance, and they consider the ignorant Dravya-lingis to be their gurus and worship them! Counterfeit rupees do not yield the value of a paisa when spent! Because - Bhava is the first ling, Dravya-ling is not the ultimate reality, Bhava is the cause of guna-daan, as Jin Bhagwan says. The external scriptures are abandoned for the sake of the purification of Bhava, but the internal abandonment of the scriptures of raga-dvesha, etc., is nil.

*

But those who are yogis with the staff of yoga, they do not give any existence to the Bhava-less Dravya-ling, they only look at the Bhava-atma-parinaam, they give importance to the Bhava-lingi who is Bhava-atma, they evaluate Darshan-jnana-charitra-tap, etc., based on the measure of the manifestation of Bhava-ling's self-awareness, they accept the true, genuine, principal, rupee-like Bhava-lingi. Because they know well that - the metal is counterfeit and the imprint is counterfeit, or the metal is counterfeit and the imprint is real, these two types are like counterfeit rupees, worthless Dravya-lingi sadhus, they are completely invalid and unacceptable; and the metal is real but the imprint is counterfeit, or the metal is real and the imprint is also real, these two types are like silver rupees, true, valuable Bhava-lingi sadhus, and they are completely valid. Therefore, they accept both types of Bhava-sadhus - those who are sadhus by Dravya and those who are sadhus by Bhava, or those who are not sadhus by Dravya but are sadhus by Bhava. How much Atma-guna has manifested in a particular person? How far have they progressed in yoga? In what stage of yoga are they? What is their guna-sthana? Is their inner mind (kashya-mundan-rupa) purified or not? Have they become a true, ultimate, sadhu 'muni' by Atma? etc., they investigate. Because they are truly aware of its characteristics, they know

x" भावो हि पढमलिंग ण दव्वलिंगं च जाण परमत्थं । मवेद जारळमू मूळरेमाळ नळ स्थिતિ ।।” etc.
Shri Kundakundaacharya, inspired by Bhava

k
तत्र बाला रतो लिंगे वृत्तान्वेषी तु मध्यमः । पंडितः सर्वयत्नेन शास्त्रतत्त्वं परीक्षते । गृहत्यागादिकं लिंग बाह्य शुद्धि विना वृथा । न भेषजं बिनारोग्यं वैद्यवेषेण रोगिणः ॥ "  Shri Chaviyat Ha Dva

## Friend's Perspective: The Glory of Devotion to the True Guru

(129) **Ke** - The one who is self-knowing, equanimous, and free from attachment, who acts according to their past karma, completely free from desire, with an unhindered mind, and whose speech is unprecedented, never heard before, is the true **Sadguru**. The **Chattis Guṇo Guru Makṣ** knows that the one who is self-knowing, self-experienced, constantly immersed in the self, self-absorbed, who reveals the true nature of things, who follows the eternal tradition of the wise and virtuous, who is always unwavering, and who is a person of equanimity, practicing the **Samvara** (purification) of the **Kiyā** (actions), is the true **Shraman**, the true **Sadhu**, the true **Muni**, and the true **Nigranth**. The rest are merely **Dravyalingi** (materialistic) **Veshadhari** (clothed in disguise). Thus, they recognize and respect only those who are true **Bhavayogi** (devotees of the essence), like **Bhavacarya** (spiritual teacher) and others. They do not care if someone wears white clothes, yellow robes, a loincloth, or is **Digambar** (sky-clad). Because **Dharma** (righteousness) is not hidden in clothes! Therefore, they do not get caught up in appearances! They bow down wherever they see true **Bhavasadhu** (spiritual essence), and such **Bhavagis** (devotees of the essence) are the ones who have a primary place in this path. Only **Bhavagis** are asked about their **Bhavas** (essence); the **Dravyacarya** (materialistic teacher) and others are not asked about their **Dravyas** (material possessions). Because -

“The self-knowing one is called a **Shraman**, others are **Dravyalingi** (materialistic); the one who reveals the true nature of things, is the **Anandghan** (treasure of bliss) **Mat Sanghi** (follower of the path)... **Vasupujya**.” The worldly people are **Indriyarami** (attached to the senses), the **Muni** is **Atmarami** (absorbed in the self); the one who is primarily **Atmarami** is called **Nishkami** (selfless) **Shreyans** (the best). “**Agamdhara** (scriptural) **Guru** of **Samakiti** (equanimity), **Kiriya** (action) **Samvara** (purification) is the essence; **Sampradayi** (traditional) **Avachaka** (unwavering) always, **Shuchi** (pure) **Anubhav** (experience) is the foundation. **Shantijina**” - **Shri Anandghanji** - Self-knowledge, equanimity, the practice of **Uday** (awakening) and **Prayog** (experimentation); unprecedented speech, the highest **Thut** (truth), the characteristics of a **Sadguru** are appropriate. “Where there is self-knowledge, there is **Muni**-hood, that is the true **Guru**; the rest are **Kulguru** (traditional guru) **Kalpana** (imagination), not for the **Atmarthi** (seeker of the self).” - **Shri Atmasiddhi** “**Sammanti** (agreement) is the path, **Noti** (disagreement) is not the path.” - **Shri Acharang Sutra** “When the work is done, the **Tinako** (small piece of wood) is discarded, the mind is **Mund** (empty) and **Mundaya** (emptied) - **Shri Chidanandji** “The highest **Vahu** (many) understand **Yuddho** (war) and **Evi** (such) **Mul** (root) **Jali** (net); **Taddhi** (therefore) **Dar** (look) **Save** (all) **Mul** (root) **Vanti** (turn) **Ni** (not) **Valu** (turn).” - **Shri Kundakundacharya**'s **Samayasar** “**Panvihasammacharanavayavavaharayarasamiisajjhae**. **Igasanvega** (egoistic emotions) **A** (not) **Rao** (arise), **Chattisguna** (thirty-six qualities) **Guru** **Jayau** (victorious).” - **Shri Vajuvamiprishishya**'s **Gurugunachhattissi**

The highest seed is to have a pure, skillful mind towards the Acharya and others, like a vigilant observer, with a pure, clear, and direct feeling of reverence. To bow to them with reverence, etc., is the highest seed. Just as devotion to the Jinas is the highest seed, so too is devotion to the Sadguru, the true Guru, the highest seed. This is the ultimate intention of the great author. The greatness of this devotion to the Sadguru has been sung by the scriptures to the extent that they have equated the Sadguru with the Jinas. The Tirthavasa's hymn, "Maru Nigam," (Shri Gachchhachar Panna), and the one who explains the form of the Jinas is also the Sadguru, so he is considered to be of great benefit, and therefore even more so. Placing the Arihant and Siddha before the Panchaparameshthi also indicates the greatness of the direct Sadguru, because the path of self-welfare is the main highway for the soul. The soul, through its own efforts, etc., goes through many great continents, but it reaches the Sadguru's shelter with little effort. The enemies of the soul, such as pride, etc., are also easily overcome by this. Without the shelter of the saints' feet, even with infinite effort, the infinite cycle of births and deaths does not cease, but with the shelter of the saints' feet, it ends in a short time. These wise men, with their firm determination, have considered devotion to the Sadguru as the highest seed. Because,
"Serve the feet of the Sadguru,
Abandoning your own side,
You attain the ultimate goal,
Take your own position as your goal.
Without a direct Sadguru,
Without the benefit of the Jinas as your goal,
The thought of the self does not arise.
Without the teachings of the Sadguru,
The form of the Jinas cannot be understood;
Without understanding the benefit,
The time for the form of the Jinas.
The direct Sadguru, by his own will,
Stays with you;
By other means,
It often doubles.
Abandoning the attachment to your own efforts,
With the right attitude,
He has spoken to you,
Because he has counted the reasons directly.
The enemies of pride, etc.,
Do not die of their own accord;
Going to the shelter of the Sadguru,
They go with little effort."
Shrimad Rajchandra's Shri Atmasiddhi
And to show reverence to such great and benevolent, supremely beneficial, Bhavacharya, Bhavamuni, etc., to serve them with devotion, is also the highest seed, as is easily understood.

**Friendship's Eye: Service to the Worthy**
(131)

Service to a worthy person, performed according to the proper method, is possible. To find such an opportunity is a great blessing. In the context of *Vyaavrutya*, a *Vyaavruttabhav* is a characteristic, meaning a state where ego, attachment, and other such feelings have been overcome and abandoned. 

*Vyaavrutya*-service should be performed without ego, attachment, or expectation of reward. Alternatively, it can be defined as "when someone is afflicted with a disease, etc., to provide them with appropriate resistance and prevention according to one's ability, is called *Vyaavrutya*-service." Such *Vyaavrutya* should be performed towards a *Sadguru* (true teacher), *Sadhu* (saint), etc., according to the methods prescribed in the scriptures, such as offering food, medicine, etc. In this method, the following points should be carefully considered:

(1) The specific person to whom the *Vyaavrutya* is being performed - their age, physical constitution, state, etc., should be taken into account. (2) How can they be helped? What can be done to ensure that they can continue their spiritual practice without hindrance? Such considerations should also be kept in mind. (3) In this way, performing selfless service to a *Muni* (ascetic), etc., according to the proper method, even in the physical body, is equivalent to what? In reality, I am serving the soul of my father. By doing this, I am rescuing my own soul from the ocean of worldly existence. I am fortunate that today I have received the opportunity to serve such a worthy, great, and virtuous person - such thoughts should be cultivated towards the soul of one's father. (4) The *Vyaavrutya*-service that I am performing should be considered as an act of obedience to God. (5) This *Vyaavrutya* should be performed completely without expectation, without any desire for personal gain, without seeking any reward. I will serve - this *Muni*, etc., will show me some attainment, some accomplishment, will show me some miraculous *mantra* (incantation) or *tantra* (ritual), will give me some special blessing like "Go, child! You will be prosperous, you will attain wealth, sons, etc., worldly achievements, or in the afterlife, you will attain such and such fruits" - such expectations related to this life and the next life, such evil and false hopes, should not be present in *Vyaavrutya*-service. And that is why it is said here that pure intention should be maintained, only pure mental activity should be present.

Regarding the service and devotion to the *Sadguru*, Saint Jnaneshwarji says: "That service to the *Guru* is the birthplace of all things. Because the soul, which has been sucked dry by the world, is brought back to its true nature by the *Guru*."

*“Vyaadhyaapun teedapi tevaan vidhiyaa / Swashaktyaa yatpratikaare vaayaavrutyaan taduchhyate.”*

- *Tattvarthasar*, by Shri Amritchandracharya

This creates a collection of virtues. Just as the entire water reservoir of the father merges into the ocean of Guru Seva, or the Shruti enters the Brahma Pad, or a devoted wife dedicates her life and all her virtues to her beloved husband, in the same way, one dedicates their inner and outer being to the Guru Kula, and makes their father's body the abode of the Guru Kula. - Knowledge stands in service before those who have such unique love for the Guru Kula. Guru's grace is the rain of nectar, and we are the vessels that receive it.
“We should search and find such holy characters and take care of their food, drink, clothes, utensils, medicine, and shelter; we should serve them with devotion. There are such worthy people who are only engaged in the welfare of their own and others' souls, and who do not even expect anything for their own body. By giving them donations, serving them with devotion, and obtaining their blessings, I can benefit my powers. Oh! When will I be fulfilled? We should always have such good intentions.
Shri Mansukh Bhai Kirchand's Dan Dharma Panchachar,
Thus, knowing the infinite and boundless grace of the Guru Bhagwan, the devoted person serves him with unique devotion. He thinks, "What a miraculous and wonderful grace has this merciful and compassionate Sadguru Bhagwan bestowed upon me, a mere mortal! I am completely incapable of repaying this grace. What can I offer? Then what can I offer at the feet of this Lord? Because everything else is inferior to the soul, and this soul has been given to me by this Lord. Therefore, surrendering to his feet is the only remedy." Thinking this, he surrenders his soul to the Sadguru's feet, becomes obedient, and becomes a servant, a servant, and dust of his feet.
“Oh! Oh! Shri Sadguru, the ocean of compassion, boundless;
This mortal has been graced by the Lord, Oh! Oh! What grace. What can I offer at the Lord's feet? Everything else is inferior to the soul; it was given to me by the Lord, so I am surrendered to his feet. From this day forward, this body and everything else is surrendered to the Lord, a servant, a servant, I am a servant, I am humble before the Lord.” - Shri Atmasiddhi

**Friend's View:** Natural Bhava Udvēga

(133) And this pure Āśaya Viśēṣa and the types of Kālabhāva are present, therefore, the second antra, which has been almost said, says:

**Bhava Udvēga** is natural and the acceptance of material possessions is also natural.  Similarly, by following the principles, writing, etc., is also a seed. 27

**Meaning:** And natural Bhava Udvēga (dispassion towards the world), the acceptance of material possessions, and writing, etc., by following the principles are also seeds.

**Discussion:** Bhava Udvēga is a seed. - In the Śrī G. 10th chapter, the seeds of devotion to the Lord and devotion to the Guru were shown, in addition to these, there are other seeds: (1) Natural Bhava Udvēga, (2) Acceptance of material possessions, (3) Writing, etc., according to the principles.

1. **Natural Bhava Udvēga:** Dispassion towards the world, extreme boredom, and inner dispassion are also excellent seeds. And this dispassion should also be natural, - not due to the loss of a loved one, bad company, illness, or other suffering. This is a type of hatred. Such suffering-filled "masāṇiā" dispassion is not even worthy of the name "dispassion." Because this suffering-filled dispassion is a type of Ārtadhyāna, therefore, such boredom-like dispassion is not worthy of being a seed of yoga. But birth, old age, death, fear, sorrow, etc., are the causes of dispassion towards the world, boredom, and dislike. It is natural, not due to the loss of a loved one, etc., because it is a form of Ārtadhyāna (dispassion arising due to the loss of a loved one, etc., is a form of Ārtadhyāna). It has been said that - "Pratyutpannānnu Suvānni Joṣa Daśaḥ = Vairay" etc., "Dispassion, boredom, and hatred arising from suffering are not dispassion." Natural Bhava Udvēga is a seed of yoga, this connection continues.

And **Acceptance of material possessions:** Acceptance of material possessions, by relying on the giving of medicines, etc. It is impossible for the feeling of destruction and pacification to be a single knot, therefore, the acceptance of material possessions is a seed.

And **Writing, etc., according to the principles:** By relying on the meaning, the subject matter, which is the principle, - not on the scriptures of desire, etc., what? Then - according to the principles - according to the principles, by following the characteristics of the righteous use of wealth, etc., which is justified by justice; what? Then - writing, etc., is also a seed. 

Page #200:
---------------------------
(134)
Considering the true nature of the sorrowful world, as revealed by the yogic perspective, which includes the collection of all suffering, a natural aversion arises towards this inherently suffering world. This genuine dispassion is called "gabij" and is the subject of this discussion. This is because the discerning individual, with their yogic perspective, clearly perceives the nature of the world:

“Born, aged, and died, this world is impermanent. All beings experience karma, and no one can hold onto anything.”
–Shri Vinayavijayajikrit Punyaprakash

“The umbrella that is held over the head, the staff that is held in the hand, even those are gone, leaving behind the endless web of Maya.” –Shri Padmavijayaji

“When illness manifests in the body, it cannot be taken away by anyone else. It is the one self, the one soul, the one father. This is the wisdom of the wise. The lightning, the wealth, the king, the moth, the lifespan, the water wave, the Purandari bow, the beautiful colors, what is the use of these fleeting moments?” –Shrimad Rajchandraji

Thus, recognizing the nature of the world, the great soul addresses the soul with compassion: “Oh, living being! You have drunk the milk of countless mothers over countless births. If you were to gather it all, it would exceed the water of the ocean! Oh, living being! The tears of countless mothers have flowed at your death. If you were to gather them all, it would exceed the water of the ocean! Thus, oh, living being! You have experienced countless births and deaths. Who is your son, who is your father, who is your wife?”

“The story of the great king, the king of the universe, is like the water of the ocean. The sorrow of your death is like the sorrow of countless mothers. The sorrow of your death is like the sorrow of countless mothers.” –Shri Kundakundacharyajikrit Bhavaprat

“Whose son, whose father, whose wife? The soul wanders in the ocean of existence, difficult to cross.” –Shri Amritchandracharyajikrit Shri Tatvarth Saar

“All relationships arising from the ocean of existence are fraught with suffering. Humans are born and die, leaving behind nothing but emptiness. The union of lovers is like a city in the sky, youth and wealth are like the surface of a cloud, the body of one's family and children are like lightning, fleeting. Know that the entire cycle of existence is momentary.” –Shri Shubhachandracharyajikrit Shri Jnanarnava

“The fruits of the tree of birth and death fall down and perish. The soul wanders in the cycle of birth and death for a long time.” –Shri Atmanushasan

Page #201:
---------------------------
**Friendship's Perspective: A Feeling of Renunciation**

(135) Mother and wife, who are they? In this insurmountable ocean of the world, this soul wanders alone. All the relationships that arise in this ocean of the world become places of misfortune for humans and ultimately prove to be extremely dull. Oh soul! Don't you see this from your own experiences? The love and affection in this world, how much of it is false, illusory, and full of selfish schemes. Don't you have a strong experience of this? Loved ones are like the celestial city of Gagananagar, youth and wealth are like clouds, relatives, children, and the body are like lightning, fickle. Thus, the entire worldly existence is momentary. Oh soul! You know this, yet why do you rejoice in your mind when you see this fleeting splendor and family? This fleeting life is like a drop of water on the tip of a blade of grass. How long will it take for this fleeting life-fruit, which has fallen from the palm tree of birth, to reach the land of death? Therefore, oh foolish soul! Seek refuge in the Great One! Seek refuge in the Great One! Now, be free from this endless, sorrowful world! Be free! "Foolish, you are deluded, foolish, you are deluded, thinking of your wealth and family in your heart. Like water on a blade of grass, trembling with the wind, know that life is worthless."

Shri Vinayavijayjit Shri Shantasudharas.

And so on, by contemplating in this way, a natural feeling of renunciation arises in him. He becomes weary of the world, tired, and has a strong desire to escape from this cycle of birth and death. He desires liberation and truly becomes a seeker. Then, with renunciation, he searches diligently for a true spiritual guide to learn the means of liberation. When he finds such a guide, who is rare and has a pure mind, he considers it a great blessing and with devotion, he acts according to his instructions. Therefore, when the teachings of the spiritual guide reach such a renounced soul, he attains right knowledge and other auspicious traditions, because his mind has become soft due to the water of renunciation, and knowledge sprouts within him. Thus, true inner renunciation becomes the best seed for him. And until the color of such inner renunciation is not imprinted on the mind, the soul does not develop the capacity to attain knowledge. As long as the mind is hard, theoretical knowledge cannot penetrate it, it only passes over the surface. But when the mind becomes soft and moist through the watering of renunciation, then the seed of right knowledge can be sown in it.

Shri Mansukh Bhai (the revered father of this commentator) has rightly said in the introduction to Shantasudharas, "Until the mind's activities are cleansed of the dirt of desires by the purifying agent of renunciation, the soul will not be able to absorb the nourishing medicine of the teachings, which is like a chemical, and it will be unsuccessful."

(136)
How can the seed of knowledge, the principle of true knowledge, be sown in the soil of the mind until it is thoroughly soaked with the water of detachment? It cannot be sown; yet, even if it is projected there, it will not take root, it will be in vain.”
“Detachment and dispassion do not reside in the mind, and knowledge does not arise from them; when detachment and dispassion cease, one forgets one’s true nature. Detachment and dispassion are successful only when they are accompanied by self-knowledge; and self-knowledge is the cause of their attainment.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji Prabhu
Shri Atmasiddhi rightly calls this natural urge to be free from worldly anxieties - true inner detachment - the best seed. And thus, the seeds that have been mentioned so far are as follows:
“The seed of devotion is sown in this world, by offering pure salutations to the Jinas; by serving the principles of conduct, by being free from worldly anxieties... - Shri G. Sajjaya 2-8
2. The practice of non-attachment to material possessions and the practice of non-attachment to material possessions - service - is also an excellent yogic seed. Giving to worthy recipients such as monks, etc., pure food, medicine, scriptures, and equipment, giving in accordance with the right principles, etc., is non-attachment to material possessions, it is a good intention. Attachment to worthy recipients - the field - is found in those who have broken the knots, and those who have not yet broken the knots do not have this attachment, so here the practice of non-attachment to material possessions has been taken. To give, according to one’s ability, in accordance with the proper rituals, to a true monk who is immersed in meditation, who does not even have a single hair on his body, and who has pure intentions in his journey through life for the sake of self-control, is described in the scriptures as being of the highest merit. Just as a small banyan seed that falls on the earth, in time, becomes a large tree that is beautiful with shade and full of sweet fruit, so too, a small gift of a seed given to a worthy person at the right time with devotion, in time, becomes a large tree of liberation, beautiful with the shade of great wealth and full of the sweet fruit of liberation.
x “Just as a banyan seed that falls on the earth, a small gift given to a worthy person, in time, bears fruit, beautiful with shade and full of sweet fruit, for those who have bodies.” - Shri Samantabhadracharya’s Ratnakara-karandashravaka-achara

## Friend's View: Public Giving

(137) Just as a seed sown in good soil sprouts, bears countless fruits, and produces infinite seeds, which in turn produce infinite seeds, thus perpetuating the merit of infinite fruits, similarly, giving to a worthy soul leads to infinite welfare. If one offers food and drink with devotion to a worthy sage, it nourishes the body of that worthy soul, and that worthy soul then teaches others, leading to the welfare of many beings and creating many more worthy souls. This, in turn, leads to the creation of many more worthy souls, and so on, resulting in the cause of much and worthy. Thus, giving to a worthy soul leads to the creation of many worthy souls, which are the cause of immeasurable welfare for beings.

– Shri Mansukh Bhai Kiratchandra Mehta, *Daan Dharma* – *Panchachar*

In one way, liberation is achieved through giving. Because the path to liberation is based on right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, it is followed by great sages, and they practice this path through their bodies. The body survives on food, so giving pure food, drink, medicine, and other things to worthy sages like munis helps them maintain the path to liberation. This is what the great sage Padmanandiji said in *Padmanadipanchavinchati* about the merit of giving. This kind of giving to worthy souls plants the seeds of such merit in the soul, which is why it is called *yogabij* (seed of yoga). The influence of giving to worthy souls has helped many beings cross the ocean of samsara, as evidenced by many examples in the scriptures, such as Shri Shreyans Kumar, Shri Shalibhadraji, and other great sages.

Or, giving to the public good is also included here. To spend one's wealth wisely for the benefit of the poor and suffering, to give charity, to give loans, to provide pure medicine, to establish hospitals and other public institutions according to the needs of the time, to provide food and water, to open schools for giving and receiving charity, and to help people during times of natural disasters or epidemics, to use all one's physical, mental, and financial resources to serve the people, especially the poor, is all praiseworthy and leads to the creation of *yogabij*. Because these acts of giving, done with a strong foundation, lead to the advancement of preaching, which in turn leads to the development of generosity and other virtues in people. This benefits many beings and leads to compassion, so the main intention here is good will. *And to emphasize the religious nature of this giving, the Lord himself said, "Giving to the needy, establishing charitable institutions, etc., all this leads to the advancement of preaching, and thus to the development of generosity and other virtues. This benefits many beings and leads to compassion, so the main intention here is good will."*

– Shri Yashovijayji, *Dva-Dva*

3.  Principles, Writings, etc. by Dharma
To write, or cause to be written, relying on the subject matter of principles, eternal scriptures, and true scriptures, is also an excellent seed of devotion. But to write, or cause to be written, relying on the false scriptures like the Kama-shastra, Artha-shastra, etc., is not a yagya. Therefore, it is said to rely on principles. "False scriptures delude the mind and throw it directly into the ocean of misery. They may sound sweet to the ears for a moment, but then they spread the poison of ignorance and pollute the soul. What is the use of such false scriptures to the soul? When true scriptures, which are the salvation of the world, exist, why would a wise person, with a good intellect, torture his own soul with false scriptures?" Thus, Shubha-chandra-acharya has said in Shri Jnanav. Therefore, false scriptures are prohibited here. The soul should only engage in writing, etc., of true scriptures.
This writing, etc., of principles should also be done according to dharma. By dharma, it means that only wealth earned justly, through righteous and honest means, should be used in such noble deeds. Wealth earned by looting, exploiting, cheating, black-marketing, and engaging in various kinds of fraud and dishonesty has no place in such noble deeds. If someone knows that he is accumulating money through various kinds of deceit and then intends to use it in such religious activities, he is merely playing in delusion, dwelling in a fool's paradise! Because wealth earned justly is the primary, primary characteristic of one who follows the righteous path, it is the first step, the first role, the first letter of the alphabet. This is what is meant by dharma here. And that wealth should also be used wisely, for the best purpose. In whatever way the respect, devotion, glory, and greatness of the principles and scriptures increase, in whatever way their influence is felt in the soul and in the world, in that way, one should use discretion in engaging in external and internal, all-round beautiful practices, writing, etc., that are appropriate and fitting. This is dharma. Shri Mansukh Bhai has said very meaningful words about this:
By dharma, it means
* " धर्माङ्गत्वं स्फुटीकर्तुं दानस्य भगवानपि । अत एव वतं ग्रहन् ददौ संवत्सरं वसु ॥ " Shri Dvada
" ज्ञापकं चात्र भगवान्निष्क्रान्तोऽपि द्विजन्मने । देवदूष्यं ददद्धीमाननुकंपा विशेषतः ॥ " Shri Haribhadra Suri's Ashtak.

## Friend's Perspective: Ritualistic Writing of Principles, etc.
(139)

We keep our ornaments, jewelry, money, gems, and precious stones, which we have received according to our merits, in beautiful cabinets, boxes, chests, or safes. So, what kind of beautiful paper, printing, binding, and other materials are needed to preserve and keep the words, which are like the precious gems of the mind, contained in the scriptures? We need very beautiful, elegant, durable, attractive, and dignified materials that enhance the glory of the scriptures and reflect the respect and devotion towards knowledge. Before a living being enters the scriptures and attains enlightenment, it is enlightened and calmed by the mere sight of these great scriptures. Nowadays, due to the use of poor quality paper, bad ink, and flimsy binding, etc., in sacred scriptures, we see a decline in respect for them everywhere.  ... We hear that a fortunate man (Sangram Soni) in the past had a copy of the sutras written in gold letters at a cost of lakhs of rupees. What does this indicate? It indicates the respect for knowledge. - Shri Shantasudharas, Preface.

66

Thus, writing the principles in a beautiful and ritualistic way, which enhances the glory, respect, and devotion towards the scriptures, and creates an impact, is also an excellent practice.

"To maintain the principle of non-possession, to give medicine, etc., as charity; to support food and income, and to show respect for writing, etc. - 20" - Shri Chag॰ Sajjay, -9

*

The word "Aadi" means:

"Writing, worship, charity, listening, reading, taking, publishing, self-study, contemplation, and feeling." - 28

Meaning: We should understand "writing, etc." as including writing, worship, charity, listening, reading, taking, publishing, self-study, contemplation, and feeling.

**Discussion**

What is done based on the principles, in the subject of supreme scriptural knowledge? This is considered a practice. Here, it is explained:

**Explanation:**

* **Writing:** Writing in a book.
* **Worship:** Worshiping with flowers, clothes, etc.
* **Charity:** Giving books, etc. as charity.
* **Listening:** Listening to lectures.
* **Reading:** Reading oneself.
* **Taking:** Accepting the principles.
* **Publishing:** Publishing the principles in front of everyone.
* **Self-study:** Studying oneself.
* **Contemplation:** Contemplating the meaning of the scriptures.
* **Feeling:** Feeling the emotions related to the principles.

All these are practices.

The act of writing down the teachings of the Gadaśṭi, in beautiful books, is called Lekhanā. It should be done on paper, with ink, and using a stamp, all of which are worthy of the principles and enhance the glory of the scriptures. It should also be done with the utmost care in terms of the purity and arrangement of the letters, syllables, words, and meanings. This is how the teachings should be written down in a perfect and beautiful book. A seeker who has attained this yogic vision considers this to be the greatest benefit of the scriptures and desires to spread its influence as much as possible. Therefore, they engage in Lekhanā and other activities to the best of their ability. They understand that the scriptures are the medicine for the disease of sin, the source of virtue, the eye that travels everywhere, and the means to all ends.
"The scriptures are the medicine for sin, the source of virtue, the eye that travels everywhere, the means to all ends." - Śrī Yogabindu, 255
Worship - To worship the scriptures with offerings like flowers, incense, lamps, etc., is called Pūjanā. This external worship is indicative of internal respect and devotion. The seeker feels that even offering their entire being for the nectar of the words of the holy ones is not enough. They desire that the nectar of the holy ones' words should illuminate their hearts with eternal knowledge. To praise the virtues of the scriptures with a pure heart is also a form of worship. For example:
"Filled with infinite shades of meaning, the scriptures are a vast ocean of knowledge.
They are the well-wisher of the entire world, the savior, the guide across the ocean of existence, the ultimate truth.
To compare them to anything else is futile, for they are beyond comparison.
Oh, King Chandra! Those who do not understand the words of the Jineshvara are like children. Only those who know them truly know." - Śrīmad Rājachandraji-pranita Śrīmokṣamālā.
Donation - To give the scriptures to another soul, or to a worthy Nigrantha Muniśvara, is called Dāna. It includes the selfless propagation of the scriptures and the effort to influence others for their own benefit. This is the donation of knowledge. There is no question of selling knowledge for material gain, for that is a wicked act.
Reading - To read the scriptures oneself is also a form of worship. It should be done with humility, discernment, and purity of mind and heart. In the absence of a true Guru, the scriptures become the ultimate refuge for the seeker. For:
"The words of the holy ones are the embodiment of the scriptures, yet constant interaction with them is not possible. Therefore, listening to their words...

(14) Since the memory of the past does not remain, and since there is a need for reflection to know the form of some emotions, and in order to increase the power of contemplation, the Vitarag-Krit-Vitarag Shastra is a powerful and helpful tool. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 694 (755)

**Udggraha** - The method of extracting the essence of the scriptures. This includes the act of initiation. It is the knowledge-based pure action performed for becoming eligible for the scriptures, for self-purification. It has the ultimate noble purpose of reverently knowing and worshipping the principles. But those who consider its sufficiency only in external pomp and action, forget its original desired purpose, and it becomes like "the snake is gone, but the stick remains!" "The noise and commotion continue, but the path to liberation remains far away" (Shri Yashovijayji) - such a tragic situation arises!

**Prakash** - The principle that was revealed to the father of light, should be revealed, shown, and made manifest to other deserving inquisitive, liberated souls, living beings. If a being has strong destruction-pacification, good understanding, and is humbly studying from a higher perspective, then he should reveal its meaning through analysis, etc., and both the speaker and the listener will benefit, and both self and others will be benefited. * The speaker will benefit whether the listener benefits or not; the revelation of the meaning of this scripture is the reason for its ultimate benefit.

**Swadhyay** - There are four types of this, including reading, etc. -
(1) **Vachana** - To obtain humility, purity, and knowledge, we should read the sutras and principles from a guru or a virtuous person who knows the essence of the sutras and principles. This is called Vachana-alamban. (2) **Pruchchhana** - To gain new knowledge, to guide us on the path of the Jineshwar Bhagwan, to remove doubts, and to examine the middle ground of others' teachings, we should ask questions to the guru, etc., with appropriate humility. This is called Pruchchhana. (3) **Paravartana** - To keep in mind the meaning of the sutras spoken by the Jinas, we should repeatedly contemplate the meaning, with pure intention and pure meaning of the sutras. This is called Paravartana-alamban. (4) **Dharmakatha** - With the same emotions as the Vitarag Bhagwan, we should adopt, understand, and especially determine those emotions, without doubt, suspicion, or hesitation, and with the intention of purity, we should express those emotions in the assembly. This will make the listeners and those who hear become devotees of the Bhagwan's commands. This is called Dharmakatha-alamban. - Shri Moksha Mala, Path 75
* "May there be religion, may there be prosperity, may there be the sound of the three-fold drum, may there be the sound of the three-fold drum, may there be the sound of the three-fold drum!" - Shri Umaswati Maharaj

(142)
**Contemplation of the Gadaṣṭi Collection** - To contemplate the essence of the principles that have been read, heard, and accepted, to engage in subtle reflection, to ponder, to analyze with discernment, this is contemplation.
**Meditation** - To repeatedly meditate on those principles, to chant them, to turn them over and over in one's mind, to focus on them, so that their imprint is firmly established in the soul, so that their essence is deeply ingrained in the soul.
**Meditation is like a crucible.** Just as gold is purified by being placed in a crucible, heated, and repeatedly subjected to the heat of the crucible, so too is the soul purified by repeatedly contemplating different things, leading to the purification of knowledge and a true understanding of reality.
**Meditation is the supreme practice for self-purification.** It leads to complete self-realization. Through meditation, the soul attains Kevalajñāna (omniscience). This is the ultimate mantra, the ultimate formula:
**"Through meditation, the soul attains Kevalajñāna."**
**Writing, reading, etc., of the principles are also excellent seeds.** To offer worship through writing, to read with devotion, to focus one's attention, to contemplate and meditate with love...
**"The seed of the scriptures, through the emotion of faith, leads to firm understanding. The desire to adopt them is pure and great."** (29)
**Commentary:** When the seed of the scriptures is heard, and the connection with the seed is established, through the emotion of faith, understanding arises. This understanding is firm, unwavering, and free from the distractions of the mind. The desire to adopt these principles is pure, leading to the desire for the fruits of the scriptures. This is the mark of a great soul, who is motivated by the desire for liberation.

## Friend's Perspective: Pure Faith from the Seed

**(143)**  Upon hearing the seed-story and its essence, the conviction arising from the inner impulse, with a firm intention, is considered a seed. And the feeling of "this is worthy of being accepted" (which is also a seed) that arises from this conviction, is a seed.

**Analysis**

"Having heard the seed-story well, the body is filled with excitement;
From this unwavering age, let us obtain the love of Dharma... Veer" - The seed mentioned in Shri Dav 11, upon hearing that seed, the conviction that arises from the inner impulse - the supreme bliss - upon hearing the story of the subject of Yoga, is also a seed. The love and faith that arises from hearing the story, the seed-story, is a seed. This love blossoms and says, "What I have heard is pure faith, it is true," and such spontaneous expressions emerge. This conviction, belief, acceptance, and inner acceptance is also a seed. And this conviction-faith is also one with a firm intention. Because the state of mind of the seeker who walks in this path of Yoga is such that the reverse flow, the opposite of what was said above, is impossible. The flow of his mind flows steadily, with a firm belief in the present. The reverse flow does not happen.

And that is why this seeker, when he hears a story of devotion to the Lord, devotion to the Guru, or devotion to the dead, he immerses himself in the loving devotional rasa, he enters into supreme bliss, his body trembles with excitement, his hair stands on end, and he speaks out in the impulse, in the utmost excitement, "All that is said is true. Devotion to the Lord, etc., is truly an unparalleled, inconceivable influence." And thus he believes with a true heart, he has faith. This inner faith-acceptance is absolutely essential. Because what fruit will the consumption of the seed yield without such faith? Any action that is performed without pure faith is like "plastering on straw," like "a bead without a string." Giraj Anandghanji has roared:

"Tell me, how can the purity of God, Guru, and Dharma remain? How can it remain? It is obtained through pure faith; whoever performs an action without pure faith, it is like plastering on straw, know this, like a sword without a hilt."

The author, the sage, goes a step further and says that even if there is no faith in the seed-story, the feeling of "this is worthy of being accepted" is also a seed. 

Page #210:
---------------------------
(144)
Respectful feelings arising from the collection of Gadasti is also a seed, and it is a big deal. The feeling of being worthy of being taught, that is, the story of the seed is also worthy of listening to the seed, such respectful thoughts arising are also commendable. Respectful feelings arising towards listening to the stories of Jinbhakti or the glory of Sadguru-Satushashtra is also a seed, because when such a feeling of being worthy of being taught arises from the color of emotion, then true desire arises from the feeling, and then it prevails in its acceptance by considering the power of the father.
This feeling of being worthy of being taught should be pure and completely pure. That is, it should be without any kind of desire for fruit related to this lake-pearl, without any desire for quick fruit attainment, it should be selfless. Because patience is the first need in all work. "Mango leaves do not come quickly." And the fruit of such a selfless, pure feeling of being worthy of being taught is also very great, it is the cause of great progress. Because it is the means of liberation, so it is not surprising that the attainment of excellent devadi motion, which is the fruit of the acquisition of merit, is also achieved along with it. Just as there are supports behind the jar, so Indrahood-Chakravattihood, etc., are obtained as the incidental fruit of the means of liberation. Thus, this feeling of being worthy of being taught towards listening to the seed ultimately becomes beneficial, then how much more beneficial is the devotion to Shri Satpurush, Sadguru, and the righteous path they have laid down?
"O Lord, your virtues are infinite! I bow to the infinite virtues, O Lord! I adore the infinite Lord; O Lord, Devchandra! I rejoice in Devchandra, O Lord! I desire the supreme great good." "May pure essence-interest become the red of the mind, O Lord. Do Jinpati devotion, O Lord, the red of the future. You will attain the position of Devchandra...mind. Supreme great good tactics, O Lord, the future." Shri Devchandraji
Thus, in this friendship, such excellent seeds are obtained: (1) Good thoughts, salutations, pure prostrations, etc., towards the Jina. (2) Good thoughts, etc., towards Bhavacharya-Bhavasadhu, etc., who are full of emotion. (3) Service to Bhavacharya-Bhavasadhu, etc. (4) Natural fear of the world-inner detachment, (5) Observance of non-attachment to material possessions. (6) Writing, etc., of the principles, worship, donation, listening, reading, taking, illuminating, self-study, contemplation, meditation. (7) Firm belief in listening to the seed story. (8) Pure feeling of being worthy of being taught.
Each of these seeds is also supremely excellent, then when they are all together, "The flowing knowledge reaches the end, O friends! It is spread among friends."
- Shri Haribhadracharya's Dharmabindu.

**Friendship's Perspective: A Great Deal of Karmic Impurities**

(145)

Why do you ask that? Here, the scriptures emphasize devotion above all else, because it is the best way to bring the soul face-to-face with the Supreme Being. Devotion to the Lord, devotion to the true Guru, and devotion to the scriptures are the main tools for attaining liberation. Because the fully enlightened Lord, being the ultimate authority, constantly reminds the soul of its true goal. The true Guru, the perfect sage, is a living embodiment, a directly experienced, awake and aware yogi, who becomes the ultimate support for the soul and provides inspiration. And in their absence, or in accordance with their instructions, the scriptures also become the ultimate support and bring great benefit.

**The Glory of Devotion**

This is how the seed of liberation is born, as it were, and this is how it is described:

"When karmic impurities are diminished, liberation arises in humans. The unmanifest consciousness does not perform any great work anywhere." (30)

**Commentary**

**Diminishment**

The scriptures have shown how the seed of liberation, pure devotion to God and Guru, etc., is acquired. Here, it is explained: When the soul's karmic impurities, the inner dirt, are greatly diminished, washed away, then the seed of liberation is planted in the mind, not when they are only slightly diminished. This is because the karmic impurities are called "bhavamala" (karmic impurities) because they are naturally connected to the subtle body, etc. The soul's inherent capacity for liberation is eternal and natural, and the tendency is that when the seed of liberation is planted, as mentioned earlier, it is planted in the mind, which is characterized by the karmic impurities that are connected to the subtle body, etc. These karmic impurities are diminished, not slightly, but greatly, abundantly, and are the result of many karmic actions. Liberation arises, manifests, in humans, because they are the ones who are eligible for it. Therefore, it is said that liberation arises in humans, not in other beings. This happens in all four states of existence. When karmic impurities are greatly diminished, not slightly, then it is said that the unmanifest consciousness, which is devoid of the discrimination of good and bad, does not perform any great work, such as the performance of rituals, etc., because it is the manifest consciousness that performs such actions, when the destruction of karmic impurities is intended. 

Page #212:
---------------------------
(146)
The accumulation of yogadushti (negative karmic tendencies) pollutes and obstructs the true nature of the soul, hence it is called "mal" (impurity).  It is deeply rooted in the pudgala (matter) and can only be removed when the bhavamal (subtle karmic impurities) is eliminated. This bhavamal, which is the pollution of the soul, needs to be significantly reduced and the mind purified for the soul to receive the gabij (seed of liberation).  Humans are primarily the recipients of this gabij, hence the mention of "manushya" (human) here. However, this reduction of bhavamal can occur in all four gatis (states of existence), making it possible for the gabij to be received in any of them.

Thus, when the soul's inner impurities are cleansed and the mind is prepared, the gabij is planted. This is why it is said here: "Avyakt chaitanya mahatu karya kare nahi" (The unmanifest consciousness cannot perform great deeds).  This means that a young soul, whose consciousness is still unmanifest and not yet revealed, is incapable of performing the great task of receiving the gabij.  For one who lacks clear awareness of consciousness, who has not yet developed the understanding of right and wrong, whose soul is still deeply asleep and not awakened, how can such a young and ignorant soul perform a great deed?  They are still under the influence of basic instincts like food, sleep, sex, etc., and are not even fully independent of their parents, so what else can they do?

Similarly, in the Nigada (one-sense) state, the soul is in a deeply unconscious state.  The Beidriya (two-sense), Teidriya (three-sense), and Chauridiya (four-sense) states also have an unmanifest state of consciousness.  Even in the Panchendriya (five-sense) state, the soul is in a similar state of unconsciousness.  In the actions of the five senses, such as seeing, hearing, etc., even aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial beings (jalachar, sthalachar, and khechar) in the Tiryanch (animal) realm rarely have an understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of the gabij.  They are mostly driven by their instincts.  Devas (gods) are engrossed in their pleasures and luxuries, making them oblivious to the gabij.  And in Naraka (hell), beings are immersed in suffering, making them unable to focus on anything else.  Even the best opportunities for attaining dharma (righteousness) are rare there.  Among humans, it is almost impossible for the Anarya (non-Aryan) caste to receive the gabij.  Even within the Arya (Aryan) caste, it is rare to be born into a family with a high level of dharma and culture.  Even if one is born into such a family, it is extremely rare to receive the teachings of true dharma.  Even if one hears these teachings, it is very rare to develop faith in them.  Even if one develops faith, it is extremely rare to have the strength and determination to practice self-control.  Thus, the rarity increases with each step.  Only when the bhavamal is significantly reduced and the highest level of punya (merit) is manifested, can one receive this supreme yog.

"Sahajantu malam vidyat karma sambandh yogyataam | Atmano'naadimatve'pi nayame naan vim vina yatah || Tasmadavashyameshtvya svaabhavikyeva yogyata | Tasyanaadimatti sa cha malananam mal uchyate ||"

## Friend's Perspective: The Rarity of the Seeds of Liberation

(147)

The attainment of the seeds of liberation is rare; only then does one get the rare vision of the Lord; only then does one get the materials for the path of liberation, such as the guidance of a true Guru. Thus, the seeds of liberation, such as the day of the Jina, devotion to the Jina, etc., are extremely rare. That is why great souls like Shriman Anandghanji, Shriman Devchandraji, Shriman Yashovijayji, Shrimad Rajchandraji, etc., who were great saints and devotees, have sung with great devotion:

“Suhum Nigoad Na Dekhiyo… Sakhi! Dekhan De! Khader Atihi Vishesh… Sakhi, Pudhavi Aa Na Pekhiya… Sakhi Te Va Na Lesh… Sakhi Vansapati Ati Ghanu Ha… Sakhi, Ditho Nahi. Ya Didar… Sakhi Biti Charuridi Jal Liha… Sakhi Sur Tiri Niray Niwasma… Sakhi Apjata Prabhasma… Sakhi, Em Anek Thal Janiye… Sakhi Aagamthi Mati Aaniye… Sakhi, Gati Sanni Pan Dhar… Sakhi Manuj Anaraj Sathe… Sakhi, Chatur Na Chadiya Hath… Sakhi, Darisan Vishnu Jin Dev… Sakhi, Kije Nimal Sev… Sakhi.” – Shri Anandghanji

…Y[ 0

“Jagatarak Prabhu Vinavu, Vinatdi Avadhar Re; Tuj Darsan Vishnu Hu Bhamhya, Kaal Anant Aapara Re… Jag, Ayar Bhamhya Prabhu Navi Malyo, Mithya Avirati Jodi Parparinati Ragipane, Parrasarange Rakt Re; Pargrahak Rakshakpane, Parabhage Aasakt Re… Jag.” – Shri Devchandraji

“Jinpe Bhav Vina Kabu, Chhutat Nahi Dukhbhav.”

“Jakh Jagege Aatma, Tam Lagege Rang.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji

“Dithi Ha Prabhu Dithi Jagadguru Tuj, Murati He. Prabhu Murati Mohanveldi Ji; Kaliyuge He Prabhu Kaliyuge Dulho Tuj, Darshanu He Prabhu Darishan Lahyu Asha Lijhi.” – Shri Yashovijayji

**The Importance of Human Birth**

Thus, although the seeds of liberation, such as devotion to the Jina, are excellent, their attainment is primarily possible in the human realm. The great souls have called human birth the best. Because:

The attainment of liberation is extremely rare, and it is not possible in any other body. It is not possible in the realms of gods, demi-gods, or hell. Liberation is only possible in the human body.

In any other body, the complete destruction of all karmas cannot arise, and one cannot enter the path of liberation. Therefore, we…

(148)
This very rare human body, obtained through a collection of good deeds, must be made successful. Some foolish people waste this human body in vices, ignorance, worldly attachments, and various kinds of intoxication; they lose their invaluable jewel. They are called human beings in name, but in reality, they are like monkeys.”
“Oh, how fortunate is the human being who has obtained this auspicious body through a collection of great merits! Yet, alas! He does not escape the cycle of birth and death even once; he loses the happiness he has attained. Fight for even a moment, for this terrible fear of death, oh! Will you remain content?” - Shrimad Rajchandraji
The author of Shri Moksha Mala, recognizing that even in this extremely rare and precious human birth, the opportunity to attain the right path, which is like a seed, is often missed, advises the seeker to worship with utmost devotion, using the tools of devotion to the Lord, service to the Guru, etc., and to make this human body meaningful as quickly as possible.
He explains this by saying:
चरमे पुद्गलावः क्षयश्चास्योपपद्यते । जीवानां लक्षणं तत्र यत एतदुदाहृतम् ॥३१॥ In the last pudgalavarta, this bhavamala is destroyed;
Because the characteristic of the jivas there is as described here - 31
Meaning: - And in the last pudgalavarta, this bhavamala is destroyed; because the characteristic of the jivas there is as described here (below).
दुःखितेषु दयात्यन्तमद्वेषो गुणवत्सु च ।
औचित्यात्सेवनं चैव सर्वत्रैवाविशेषतः ॥ ३२ ॥ Vritti: - 2 Punarav - In the last pudgalavarta, in the last pudgalavarta with the characteristic of being yakt, this bhavamala is destroyed. Vivaanaa kshaane tatra - there, in the last pudgalavarta, the characteristic of the jiva is, chat putatulatamu - because this (what is being said) is said.
Vritti: - Fulllitepu - towards those who are suffering from bodily pain, etc., yachant - extreme compassion, sympathy, compassion; asha - asha, amatsara. Towards whom? Towards those who are virtuous, endowed with virtues like knowledge, etc. Shaunityans evan vaiv - similarly, service with propriety, service according to the scriptures; satra - everywhere, towards the poor, etc., avisheshatah - without distinction, generally.

##  Mitaadashti: Compassion towards the suffering

**(149)**  Compassion towards the suffering, non-hatred towards the virtuous;
Serving appropriately and without discrimination everywhere. 

**Meaning:**  Extreme compassion towards the suffering, non-hatred towards the virtuous, and serving appropriately and without discrimination everywhere, are the characteristics of the last stage of the soul's evolution.

**Explanation:**  The main characteristics of the soul in the last stage of its evolution, as described in the Yugalfera, are: (1) Extreme compassion towards the suffering, (2) Non-hatred towards the virtuous, and (3) Serving appropriately everywhere.

Extreme compassion towards the suffering:**  Compassion towards those who are suffering from physical ailments like illness, or mental suffering due to poverty, misfortune, etc., or those who are suffering due to the afflictions of the body, mind, and senses.  Compassion towards those who are distressed and tormented by suffering. This is the first characteristic.  

**Compassion** is the feeling of empathy that arises when we witness the suffering of another being. It is like feeling the pain of another as if it were our own.  It is like the feeling of compassion that arises when one part of the body is in pain, and the other parts of the body also feel the pain.  Compassion is feeling the pain of another as if it were our own.  Just as a father is always eager to alleviate the suffering of his child, so too should we be eager to alleviate the suffering of others.  This is true compassion or mercy.  

**Compassion** is the desire to alleviate the suffering of others.  

“The desire to alleviate the suffering of others is compassion.” - Shri Anandghanji

“Oh, Vaishnav Jan, know the pain of others.” - Shri Narasimha Mehta

How can one who desires to cultivate such noble compassion inflict suffering on others? How can one cause pain?  How can one harm even the most subtle of beings, who are all interconnected?  How can one harm any being, big or small?  How can one hurt their feelings?  One should always refrain from harming any being in thought, word, or deed.  Not only that, but one should always strive to protect all beings.

This compassion is the root of the tree of Dharma, the essence of all principles, the agreement of all philosophies, the first of all vows, the source of all happiness and prosperity, and the well-wisher of all beings.  There is no other Dharma like it.  “Ahimsa Paramo Dharma” - Non-violence is the highest Dharma.

The collection of virtues like truth, conduct, charity, etc. are like bodyguards who protect compassion. Without compassion, all of them are incomplete. The great sages have said:
“The essence of Dharma, if you ask me, I will tell you,
The principle that is good for all, beneficial to all.
The Lord spoke in his speech, there is no Dharma like compassion,
Giving refuge and contentment, it is a sin to crush any creature.
Truth, conduct, and all charity, are only complete with compassion;
Without compassion, they are nothing, like the sun without its rays.” - Shri Moksha Mala
“Whoever has compassion in their heart, they will do good deeds, whether they are done or not. - Mahatma Kabirji
“Do not abandon compassion, as long as there is breath in the body.” - Shri Tulsidasji

2. Non-envy towards the virtuous
Non-envy towards the virtuous, being free from jealousy, is the second characteristic of the last pudgalavarna. Envy towards virtue is called jealousy, which should not be present here. Whoever appears superior to oneself in virtues like knowledge, humility, discernment, wisdom, vision, character, austerity, etc., should not be disliked; but instead, one should be happy and pleased upon seeing those virtues, and feel a sense of joy, thinking, “Blessed is this person! How well-developed are their knowledge, humility, and discernment! What a wise and virtuous person they are!” Thus, even a tiny atom of virtue in another should be considered like a mountain, and should always flourish and blossom in the heart like a father’s love. If one becomes truly devoted to virtue in this way, then it is understood that this is a sign of the last pudgalavarna.
“Considering the atom of virtue in another as a mountain, always,
The mind should be patient and free from envy.” - Shri Bhartrihari
“Let there be an abundance of joy in virtue, let the mind be inward-focused.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji
Seeing the virtue of others and feeling joy, happiness, and contentment is the characteristic of a virtuous person. The beautiful word-picture* of how a virtuous person feels this joy is given here:
“May your tongue be eloquent in praising the virtuous,
May I be blessed with the ability to praise others today.
May my eyes quickly find joy in seeing the prosperity of others,
May I be free from the suffering of the world.” - Shri Shantasudharas

*The word-picture is a metaphor for the vivid and detailed description of the feeling of joy.

## Friendliness: Non-hatred towards the virtuous, service to all with propriety

(151) "Oh tongue! You become pure and prosperous by reciting the good conduct of virtuous beings. Oh ears! Today, you become successful, meaning fruitful, by gaining interest in listening to the deeds of others. Oh eyes! Be satisfied, be filled with joy, and let tears of happiness flow from you upon seeing the excellent fortune and prosperity of others. Oh tongue! Oh ears! Oh eyes! In this impermanent world, such feelings are the ultimate meaning of your birth."
- Shri Mansukh Bhai Kartachandra's *Shant Sudharas Vivechan*

"Blessed, blessed is that being who serves the Lord, who listens to the country, who performs pure knowledge and action, who experiences it himself, who serves God." - Shri Devchandraji

"In the past, joy in the virtuous, compassion for suffering beings, opposite to the attitude of mediation, Oh God! May my soul always be like that." - Shri Amitagati Acharya's *Samayik Path* (Translated by Dayabhagwan Das)

3. Service to all without distinction, with propriety, as stated in the scriptures, is the third characteristic. "Following propriety removes dissatisfaction and promotes activity, thus leading to the destruction of karma." Therefore, the soul should do whatever is necessary wherever it is, and understand whatever is necessary wherever it is.

"Understand wherever what is appropriate,
Act accordingly wherever, with the soul." - Shri Atmasiddhi

And even more so, without distinction - without any kind of discrimination, serving all, including the poor, the suffering, etc., as appropriate, is proper service. Here, propriety, appropriateness, should be understood as follows:

- The service rendered to a virtuous person, a true saintly character, should be primarily motivated by devotion.
- The service rendered to the suffering, the poor, the disabled, etc., should be primarily motivated by compassion.

"All are friendly, like wheat,
Compassion is the rain that falls."

"May my soul always be like that,
Opposite to the attitude of mediation."

"Activity should be based on propriety. - *Santvritti Niyamatra Chatah* - Shri Yogabindu

"Compassion should be towards the one who needs it, devotion towards the worthy. - *Anyatha Thirattu Ranamatiwa Saksham* - Shri Yashovijayji's *Dva Dva*

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya

Whoever they may be, whatever their sect, whatever their caste, they should be served with impartial true compassion. The Jineshwar Bhagwan has never prohibited this compassion-based giving. To establish charitable kitchens, dispensaries, hospitals, etc., for the service and care of the poor, the suffering, the passionate, etc., is beneficial to many beings, it is the purpose of compassion, it is the cause of good intentions. By relying on the strong world, this service of giving, etc., elevates the preaching, and it becomes the cause of welfare.

In this work of giving, etc., it is very important to maintain propriety. One should consider the substance, the field, the time, the feeling, etc., and act accordingly. To give with a trivial feeling like "Take it, animal, take it!" or with the feeling of "keeping one's hand above," is not proper, but improper. To give to a deserving recipient with the proper feeling, in the proper way, with respect, so that the recipient does not feel their own poverty, helplessness, or dependence, so that they do not feel burdened, so that they do not feel like they are being given alms, but rather like "the right hand gives and the left hand does not know," is proper. To show disrespect to the poor and suffering patients in hospitals and dispensaries, to know that "they are just mortals" and not take proper care of them, is not proper. But to show special kindness to the poor patient, to take special care of them, to perform selfless service, is true propriety. Maintaining this propriety is the duty of the donor householder, and only then can true service be performed. Even in this, a little service of giving, etc., done at the right time, in the right substance, field, and feeling, is more beneficial and fruitful than a lot of service done at the wrong time. In the rain, even one seed grows many times, but without rain, millions of seeds go to waste. Therefore, in the service of dharma, it is proper to maintain the right opportunity. These are all gross examples. Thus, to serve dharma according to one's ability, as needed, to serve the people to the best of one's ability, is also a sign of the highest state.

- "Without saying anything, giving, increases the giver's wealth;
"Giving water to the thirsty chatak, makes the cloud dark..." - Shri Yashavijayaji

Thus, here three main characteristics are mentioned: compassion for the suffering, non-hatred towards the virtuous, and impartial proper service to all. Whoever possesses these characteristics, acts in the highest state, and for them:

"Even a little gain in time is better than a lot of work out of time.
The growth of a seed in water is like that." - Shri Yashavijayakrut Dva. Dva

"For the sake of explaining the limbs of dharma, even giving is considered great wisdom.
Without giving, one becomes like a dry tree." - Shri Haribhadrasuri's Ashtak.

Friend's perspective, the wise one's intention, motivation for effort.
(153) Know that the cycle of births and deaths is at its end. From these external signs, it can be inferred that the cycle of births and deaths is about to end. The rest is known only to the yogi, who has extraordinary knowledge. Therefore, if one wants to enter the final cycle, to make the last turn of the cycle of births and deaths, and to sow the seeds of liberation, then these qualities should be cultivated in the soul: the heart should be filled with compassion for the suffering, the mind should be purified by virtue, and one should become a world-lover by serving all beings. This is the teaching of the great sage.
And from this, it is also important to note that we should not become lazy and procrastinate, thinking that we will attain the path when the time is ripe, the cycle of births and deaths is complete, and the time of our birth is over. It is not appropriate to rely on the passing of time, it is not appropriate to sit with folded hands and become inactive. The wise men have spoken of the ripening of time, the completion of the cycle of births and deaths, etc., but we should not interpret it in a way that is detrimental to our efforts. The wise man's teachings will never motivate inactivity; they will only motivate effort. Therefore, we should understand the intention of the wise.
We do not know what our future is like. But it is in our hands to make an effort to ripen that future. That is, we can try to hasten the ripening of our future. Let us make an effort to increase our worthiness and merit, so that the time will ripen on its own, and we need not worry about it. For example, a seed has the potential to ripen, but it will only ripen if it is planted in the ground. It will not ripen on its own. Similarly, the soul, which is capable of liberation, will not become liberated on its own unless we make an effort to bring about liberation. Therefore, if one desires liberation, one should make a sincere effort to take steps to ripen the time, to complete the cycle of births and deaths, and to bring about the worthiness and merit in the soul. The primary step in this effort is the compassion, etc., which is clearly explained here. One should take refuge in this and achieve the goal of the soul. One should awaken the potential through the strong support of pure instrumental causes, so that the cycle of births and deaths comes to an end in the last cycle of existence, so that there are only a few births left, and even in those, as few as possible. This is the message here. In harmony with this, the great sage, the embodiment of knowledge, Shrimad Rajchandraji, the supreme saint and devotee of the present age, has uttered the following words, which are like the roar of a hero, motivating the supreme effort:

“If you desire liberation, then strive for truth, do not cut the soul by taking names like 'existence' and 'state of being'.
Compassion, peace, equality, forgiveness, truth, renunciation, detachment;
These are always awake within the seeker.” —Shri Atmasiddhi
L2
And because it is so, therefore—
Yogadashisamuccay
एवंविधस्य जीवस्य भद्रमूर्तेर्महात्मनः ।
शुभो निमित्तसंयोगो जायतेऽवञ्चकोदयात् ॥ ३३ ॥  A good-natured, great-souled being like this; from the rise of the non-obstructive, a good opportunity arises, 33
Thus—Such a good-natured, great-souled being, from the rise of the non-obstructive, a good opportunity arises.
Commentary
“Even if the bee is attracted to the sandalwood, the honeybee flies to the jasmine;
So, with inherent qualities, the best opportunity arises. Veer.” —Shri Cho. S. -13
What kind of person is the one who possesses the qualities mentioned above? They are those who are of good nature, good-natured, and have a good appearance. Just by looking at them, one gets the natural impression that they are good, kind, and noble beings. They are a good omen, their sight is pleasing and lovable, and just by looking at them, a natural love arises for them. They are dear to the gods, and they are worthy of being called 'great-souled' because they have become a refuge for the noble-souled. Such a good-natured, great-souled being has a good opportunity arise for them, they have the qualities of compassion, etc. The best opportunity easily comes to the best, it attracts them, like attracts like? According to this principle, a worthy being, due to their virtuous qualities, is attracted to and finds a suitable opportunity, and these good opportunities
Opportunity
Commentary:-Due to diversity—Such a being, with the qualities mentioned above, who is a refuge, good-natured, with a pleasing and lovable appearance, great-souled—because of their noble qualities, what? What is it? -A good opportunity, an opportunity for good fortune, etc. -because good fortune, etc. is the means for liberation, the means for liberation, it arises, from where? For this, it is said -from the non-obstructive heart. It is said that due to the excellence of this particular type of meditation, this particular type of yoga, it is so.

Friend's View: 'The work is accomplished due to the cause,
(155)
It becomes the means of the ocean of liberation. Just as the Chakera naturally loves the moon, just as the bee naturally goes to the Malati, so too, the noble-worthy, eligible being, by natural virtue, attains the excellent opportunity.
“The addiction arises like the ocean, in relation to the moon's light;
The Kumud follows the unattached, by pure nature....it will be”—Shri Yashovijayji “In the company of the excellent, excellence increases, along with joy, O Anangi”—Shri Devchandraji
And why does this excellent opportunity arise? That too is explained here. This opportunity is obtained by the arising of three obstacles. This obstacle is a special type of yoga. Its form is now being told. This obstacle-like cause is called Yaga, and the opportunity that is like it is called Yaga.
Opportunity and Material Cause
66 The work is accomplished due to the cause, there is no argument in that;
But to accomplish the work without a cause, that is the madness of one's own opinion, O Sabhava”—Shri Anandghanji “The work is accomplished with the cause, this is the eternal path....Lalana
Having obtained the position of Devchandra, one should maintain one's own feelings....Lalana”—Shri Devchandraji
Work does not happen without a cause, this is the eternal rule, but those who talk about accomplishing work without a cause, are only the madness of their own opinion. Yet, some people, due to their misunderstanding, do not have the awareness of the proper division and relationship of the material cause and opportunity, or due to their ingrained misleading ideas, understand it upside down, and grasping the one-sided view, consider the material cause and opportunity as if they were opponents, rivals of each other, and by such meaningless, dry knowledge, they keep on denigrating the highly beneficial opportunity, saying only 'material cause, material cause', which, in the words of Shri Anandghanji, is 'the madness of one's own opinion'. Because, to insist on the material cause alone or the opportunity alone, is only a manifestation of delusion, a reversal. Those who grasp such a one-sided view, do not know the fully interdependent, mutually supportive relationship of the material cause and opportunity, and by creating a one-sided, false, untrue, misleading statement, they destroy the eternal beliefs of the knowers. Because, just as nothing is gained by grasping the opportunity alone, ignoring the material cause, so too, nothing is gained by grasping the material cause alone, ignoring the opportunity.

It is true that the Yogadashtisamuchya Shastra speaks of the Upadan (material cause), but it does not do so to negate or undervalue the Nimitta (efficient cause). It is said in relation to the Jiva's (soul) awakening of Purushartha (effort), meaning it emphasizes the importance of maintaining the awakening of self-effort with a strong reliance on the pure Nimitta. This is to the extent that even the Shrutagyan (scriptural knowledge), Agyan (command), or the reliance on the Jin Bhagwan (Jina) is said to be the last peak of the twelve Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress), which indicates how beneficial and praiseworthy the use of the pure Nimitta is. Therefore, the right approach is to continue to manifest the purity of the Upadan through the reliance on the pure Nimitta, and the Jiva should progress and achieve self-development. And this is the eternal path of the Jin Bhagwan. In this regard, Shri Jinbhadragani Kshamasramanji in Shri Vishesh Avashyak and Shri Devchandraji Mahamuni in the praise of Shri Aranath-Malinath-Munisuvrat Jina, have elaborated and presented a comprehensive decision, which is very appealing to the Mumukhu (aspirant). Here, due to the fear of expansion, only a relevant indication is given: "Kaun Karan Yog Karaj Siddhi Lahiri, Karan Char Anup Karyathi Teh Shehri...Praname Shri Aranath" - Shri Devchandraji. The doer achieves the success of the work due to the non-work of the cause, therefore, he takes the four unparalleled causes that are relevant to the work. There are two main causes - Upadan and Nimitta. The inherent nature of the object is the Upadan. Until that Upadan manifests as the Upadan Karan (material cause), the object does not manifest in its true form as the result of the action. And the Upadan Karan also does not manifest without the Nimitta Karan (efficient cause). In other words, the Upadan manifests as the Upadan Karan due to the reliance and benefit of the Nimitta Karan before the doer, and therefore the action is successful. Moreover, the Nimitta does not become the Nimitta Karan if the Upadan Karan does not occur, meaning the Nimitta is not called the Nimitta Karan. When the Upadan Karan manifests in this way, then it is truly called the Nimitta Karan, otherwise not. In this way, if the desire for the work is fulfilled and the doer is inclined to do the work, he makes an effort and continues to rely on the pure and strong Nimitta Karan according to the rules, and continues to manifest the Upadan as the Upadan Karan, then the work is successful. The work is accomplished only through the cooperation and collaboration of the Nimitta and Upadan. "Nij Sattagat Dharma Te Upadan Ganatri." The Upadan manifests as the Upadan due to the inherent nature of the object, but the cause is dependent on the Nimitta, the doubt of being strong or weak is the Upad (instruction), the recipient is dependent on the rules...LD. Munisuvrat" - Shri Devchandraji. For example, the clay used to make a pot is the Upadan, but if the tools like the potter's wheel etc. are not available, it will not manifest as the Upadan Karan on its own, and a pot will never be made from clay... 

Page #223:
---------------------------
## Friend's View: The Cause and the Instrument

(157)

While the soul itself is the cause, it is not the cause in the same way as the instrument. All souls are inherently equal in their potential for liberation, but this potential is realized through the instrument. For the manifestation of this inherent potential, for the cause to become the effect, the instrument is absolutely necessary. Without the proper instrument, even after an infinite time, liberation will never be attained, and the cause will not manifest. Similarly, by neglecting the cause and only relying on the instrument, liberation cannot be achieved. Both must work together for liberation to occur.

"The cause is within you, the instrument is the pure devotion to the Jinas...worship the Jinas.
The cause is the Lord, the instrument is the devotion to the Jinas...the Jinas are the source of liberation."

"The instrument is the Jinas, the nectar of equality,
The Lord is the source of liberation, the rules are the instruments...the Jinas are the source of liberation." - Shri Devchandraji

Therefore, those who only focus on the cause, the inherent potential, and neglect the instrument, will not attain liberation and will remain lost in delusion. This is the unchanging principle that the wise have declared. The commands of the Guru, the path of the Jinas, and the three jewels are the instruments. Without these instruments, without the worship of the Lord, self-realization cannot be attained. On this point, the supreme sage Shrimad Rajchandraji has said:

"All souls are inherently equal, those who understand this will be liberated; the commands of the Guru, the path of the Jinas, are the instruments. Those who only focus on the cause and neglect the instrument,
Will not attain liberation and will remain lost in delusion." - Shri Atmasiddhi

In other words, "The commands of the Guru, etc., are the instruments for self-realization, and the knowledge of the soul, etc., are the cause. This is what the scriptures say. Therefore, those who only focus on the cause and neglect the instrument will not attain liberation and will remain lost in delusion. This is because the scriptures do not mention the cause without the instrument, but even if the instrument is present, without the cause, it will not work. Therefore, the true meaning is to use the instrument to bring the cause to the forefront, and not to neglect the instrument."

- Shrimad Rajchandra

• When it is said "the three jewels arise", it means that their form is being explained.

(158)
The three types of unwavering (avachka) are called yoga, action, and fruit. They are like the arrow's aim. 34

Meaning: By relying on the virtuous (sadhu), the three unwavering (avachka) - yoga, action, and fruit - are heard. This is like the arrow's aim.

Commentary: The pure virtuous (sadhu) attains devotion... dear, yoga is unwavering... dear. Action is unwavering, dear. The fruit is unwavering, dear, says Chandraprabhu.

The three types of unwavering (avachka) - yoga, action, and fruit - are mentioned in the scriptures. These unwavering (avachka) are a type of subtle samadhi, a special type of knowledge. The type that arises due to the destruction of passions is a special type of intention, a special type of result of the three mental states. What is "avachka"? Aavachka is that which does not deceive, does not cheat, never becomes empty, does not miss, does not go astray, is unwavering, infallible, non-contradictory, like a magic arrow. Yoga is such that it never deceives, never misses, never goes astray, it is unwavering. Action is such that it never deceives, never goes in vain, never goes astray, it is unwavering. Fruit is such that it never deceives, never becomes empty, never goes astray, it is unwavering.

This supreme unwavering (avachka) is attained by relying on the virtuous (sadhu), that is, those who are adorned with true virtuous qualities, by relying on the true "muni", the wise person. This is how the relationship is to be understood. That is, the true virtuous (sadhu) - the true guru - is the unwavering (avachka) of yoga, meditation, and knowledge; it never deceives. It is unwavering, because yoga, action, and fruit are heard in the scriptures - "Chavashva: Jiyayaa; Staavadaha" - based on this statement. This is the subtle samadhi, because there is a text on its authority. This is a special type of intention due to the destruction of different passions. And this reliance on the virtuous (sadhu) - relying on the virtuous (sadhu), the virtuous (sadhu) are the munis; this is the supreme form, it is like the arrow's aim. The arrow's aim is non-contradictory due to its main purpose, it is not separate from the aim. (The arrow aims correctly, otherwise the aim cannot be achieved.) Thus, relying on the virtuous (sadhu) is unwavering. Its speed is non-contradictory; thus, its praise and other actions and its fruits are attained by relying on it, this is how it is, from the substance. 

Page #225:
---------------------------
## Friend's View: Yoga-avachka, Diya-avachka, Phala-avachka

(159) If someone is not argumentative and then recognizes a man as a virtuous person, the actions of respect, greetings, and conversation towards him are called Diya-avachka. These actions never go in vain, they are definitely beneficial for Dharma. Similarly, when a virtuous person recognizes a Sadguru as such, the actions of respect, etc., performed towards him, never go in vain, they are unfailingly attained, and this is known as Phala-avachka. These three A-avachkas are present in this view, due to the substance.

“The action of respect towards the Sadguru, the fruit that comes from it; the action, the fruit, and the difference between them, these are the various A-avachkas...Veer” - Shri Eag Sakzaya 2-12

This trinity of A-avachkas is similar to the analogy of an arrow's target. Just as an arrow, aimed accurately at the target, will definitely hit it, not miss, not go empty, not fail, and achieve its purpose; similarly, the actions performed with pure intent, aimed at the target of self-realization, are like the arrow, and the fruit is A-avachka, it definitely achieves its goal, it is unfailing, and it achieves the desired result without any doubt. In this, aiming the arrow accurately at the target, the connection of the arrow with the bow, the pursuit, is Yoga-avachka. Similarly, the action of the arrow moving towards the target, aimed accurately, is Diya-avachka. And the achievement of the target, the result, is Phala-avachka. This analogy is full of meaning and mystery, and the following points can be derived from it:

(1) If the arrow is not aimed accurately at the target during the pursuit, its movement towards the target will also be crooked, and it will miss the target; similarly, if the goal of self-realization is not aimed at accurately, the Yoga-avachka will be flawed, the action will also be flawed, and the fruit will also be flawed. (2) If the arrow is connected to the bow accurately, aimed at the target, its movement towards the target will be straight and swift, and it will hit the target, not miss; similarly, if the goal of self-realization is aimed at accurately, the Yoga-avachka performed will be accurate, the action will also be accurate, and the fruit of achievement will also be accurate. Thus, the following is evident from this: (1) If Yoga-avachka is accurate, the action and fruit will be accurate. (2) If Yoga-avachka is accurate, the subsequent action and fruit will not be flawed. (3) If Yoga-avachka is flawed, the action and fruit will also be flawed. (4) If Yoga-avachka is flawed, the action and fruit will not be accurate. All of this can be understood clearly from the following diagram:

From the above, it will be clear that if one peg is not correct, then all the games are spoiled. And this peg depends on the Sadguru Purusha; that is, if the true Sadhu Purusha, the Sadguru, is not correct, then the action and the fruit are also spoiled. It is like this - (1) If a Sadguru Sapurusha is found, but he is not recognized, then he becomes a burden, he fails. (2) Or if an Asadguru is considered a Sadguru, then he also becomes a burden, it is like a wrong number being dialed on the telephone. 

Page #227:
---------------------------
## Friend's Perspective: An Analogy of the Target of an Arrow
(161) It is like the target of an arrow! (3) Or if you have found a Sadguru, but your father does not have the same qualifications, then it is like not getting a peg. It is like what happens when you sleep through your wedding!

And another thing to understand is that the target of an arrow is one. If the arrow goes off-target, crooked, up or down, it does not hit the target, it goes astray, it goes amiss, or it hits multiple targets, like a widow with many husbands, but it does not hit the one desired target. Similarly, in the pursuit of liberation, there is only one target, one goal. And that is the attainment of the pure soul, or liberation, which is the only goal. Therefore, the yoga, the action, that leads to liberation is the only successful one, all others are unsuccessful. Or it misses the fruit of liberation and leads to many fruits, like wandering in the four states of existence. Thus, there is unity in the disease, action, and fruit that are certain, and there is multiplicity in the disease, action, and fruit that are uncertain.

One says, "The seeker performs various actions, but the fruits are not seen, the fruits are not seen, the seeker performs various actions, and he wanders in the four states of existence...like a sharp sword."
- Shri Anandghanji

Thus, the yoga that is in pursuit of the one goal, the action that is performed in pursuit of that goal, and the one fruit of liberation that is attained, these three are certain. But if there is no yoga in pursuit of the one goal, if there are various actions with multiple goals, and therefore various fruits, like wandering in the four states of existence, then these three are uncertain. And this awareness of the goal comes from the association of a Sadguru, a virtuous person. Therefore, recognizing the true Sadguru is the cause of the cause, and is certain. Serving the virtuous Sadguru, devotion, etc., is the action that is certain, and attaining liberation as a result of that is the fruit that is certain.

"When a being recognizes a wise person, it is like an endless chain of anger, pride, delusion, and attachment falling away, and it becomes like a person who is being tested. As the being recognizes the wise person, it begins to lose its attachment to opinions, stubbornness, etc., and its mind turns back to its fatherland. It feels indifferent to worldly things, or it feels disgusted. x x x The being..."

"Those who are foolish, great, heroic, and have not seen the truth, their actions are impure, their actions are unsuccessful. Those who are wise, great, heroic, and have seen the truth, their actions are pure, their actions are successful."
- Shri Suyagadaanga Sutra (For liberation - see - Shrimad Rajchandra, Letters, 391. Notes on teachings 32)

Page #228:
---------------------------
(162)
When the confluence of the right perception (Gidashtī) and the right effort (Sandurush) happens, a feeling arises that all the efforts made so far for the sake of welfare were futile, like arrows without a target. But now, with the unprecedented union of the soul and the right effort, all my efforts are destined to succeed. 
- Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 433 (Par 2)
“The knowledge of the path is fatal to the ignorant, it is the destruction of the unskillful and the decay of the unmindful; the study of the scriptures, listening, contemplation, and investigation are the means to the goal. The seeker should have the right intention and focus on the goal.” - Shri Anandghanji
Thus, in the use of the words "deceiver" (Vachka) and "non-deceiver" (Avachaka), the divine author has explained a great truth. "Vachka" means a deceiver, a cheat, a trickster; "Avachaka" means not a deceiver, not a cheat, not a trickster. Just as a cheat deceives a person and gives him a false hope, similarly, this "Vachka" (deceiver) soul deceives, cheats, and tricks the living being by keeping him in delusion and confusion. Because, despite not being aware of the true goal, the poor soul believes that he is doing good, that he is acting, and that he will get the fruits of his actions. But he is being cheated! And despite doing endless penance and performing endless actions, he keeps wandering in the four realms of existence, crying and lamenting, because he has been misled. In this delusion, the soul has left nothing undone in performing endless penance and actions, he has not held back from any effort. But all his efforts have gone in vain, they have become like "plaster on a wall of straw," useless, and the result has been a big zero!
Because, in the endless cycle of transmigration, the soul must have taken initiation countless times, become a monk, an ascetic, a devotee! He must have used as many vows and restraints as the Mount Meru! He must have practiced countless austerities, like Yama, Niyama, Samyama, renunciation, detachment, etc.! He must have gone into the forest, endured great hardships, observed silence, and performed rigorous fasts! He must have practiced Pranayama and other yogic techniques, and attained samadhi! He must have learned about the rising of the soul, and shown miracles through mantras and tantras, captivating the ignorant! He must have performed various types of japa and tapasya! He must have become proficient in all the scriptures, and become a scholar of the Agamas, a master of the scriptures, and a learned scholar, arguing for his own views and refuting the views of others, becoming a powerful debater and conquering the world! Oh! Even though he had no foundation, he must have delivered sermons from high platforms, reaching the heavens, giving lectures that were as vast as the universe, engaging in debates like the goddess of speech, shaking the lecture halls, and captivating the audiences!

## Friend's Perspective: The Fivefold Without the Shelter of Saint's Feet (163)

This poor soul must have done so much, endlessly! But nothing has come into his hands yet! His hands are empty, empty! He was mixed up, and that's why he's fallen away!

Because the one fundamental cause, the most important thing to do first, he couldn't get his hands on it; he didn't get the true Sadguru, he hasn't reached that point yet. There's still a flaw! So all those means, even though they were true,

became bonds for him, they ended up in nothingness! Even if you have a thousand or a million electric bulbs, but the main switch isn't on, the lights won't turn on, it will remain dark. Similarly, even if you do endless practices, but you don't have the Sadguru, the light of knowledge won't shine, it will remain dark.

Regarding this, as if the entire world were roaring, with these illuminating, penetrating words, Shrimad Rajchandraji has revealed:

"You have done Yama, Niyama, and Samyama, and then you have taken renunciation, dispassion, and unwavering devotion. You have taken to the forest, kept your mouth silent, and sat firmly on the seat. You have made your mind and intellect a treasure of self-knowledge, and you have practiced Hatha Yoga with fear of the Creator. You have chanted, understood the essence of chanting, practiced austerities, and endured them. You have become detached from the world, and you have done all this. You have embraced all the scriptures and their principles, you have analyzed, refuted, and understood the different philosophies. You have done all these means, endlessly. But still, nothing has come into your hands yet. Now, what is it that you are thinking in your mind? Is there something left in those means? Without the Sadguru, you will not understand the essence. What is the point of saying all this?

Compassion is flowing towards you. That point remains with the Sadguru. It will manifest in front of you in an instant, when the supreme love of the Sadguru's feet resides within you. From your body, mind, and wealth, everything, the joy of the Gurudev will reside in your own self. Then your work will be accomplished, and you will drink the nectar of love."

- Shrimad Rajchandraji

Thus, without the shelter of the Saint's feet, all practices and actions have become futile, they have become deceitful, they have become cheats. One should take shelter in the true Satpurush, the true Bhavasadhu, the one who is full of love. By focusing on that true form, one becomes free from deceit, the actions become free from deceit, and the fruits become free from deceit. That's why the scripture writer, in the absence of the great soul, has emphasized the words "taking shelter in the Sadhu," "taking shelter in the Saint." Because before the attainment of this non-deceitful trinity, whatever yogas the soul has done, whatever actions the soul has performed, whatever fruits the soul has received, all of them have become deceitful, cheats, as shown above. 

Page #230:
---------------------------
(164)
Those who judge the collection of scriptures (Gadhisamuccaya) without the true goal of the soul are like arrows without a target! Because the soul may have encountered a virtuous person (Satpurusha) or a true guru (Sadguru), but by not recognizing them in their true form, it becomes deprived and wasted. Similarly, the soul may have performed countless actions (Sadhana) many times, but without recognizing them as such and without knowing the true form of the goal (Sadhya), it also becomes deprived and does not achieve the desired result (Ishta Karya Sadhana), instead becoming an obstacle! The means (Sadhana) themselves, due to a wrong understanding, or due to attachment (Mamata), or due to evil pride (Dushta Abhimāna), have become a bondage! And thus, the fruit (Phal) has also become deprived.

For countless ages, entangled, without awareness of God,
Did not serve the guru and saints, did not abandon pride. Without the shelter of the feet of saints, performed countless actions,
Did not attain liberation from them, did not arise the wisdom of the soul. All means became bondage, no remedy remained;
Not understanding the true means, how can bondage go away?”—Shrimad Rajchandraji

Such deprived actions and fruits are far away, here in this first stage of friendship (Mitradaeshti), the aspiring yogi (Mumukhu Yogi) attains the undeprived actions, fruits, and knowledge (Dravya), and that too by taking shelter in the feet of the saints (Sant Charana). This point needs to be kept in mind.

This undeprived triad (Avachakatraya) is also caused by something, for which it is said –

“This is established in the principle (Siddhanta) due to the means of true prostration (Satpranama) etc. And its ultimate cause is the lessening of the stain of attachment (Bhavamala).”—35

Meaning – This undeprived triad (Avachakatraya) is caused by true prostration (Satpranama) etc., it is established in the principle (Siddhanta) at that time. And the ultimate cause of this true prostration (Satpranama) etc. is the lessening of the stain of attachment (Bhavamala).

Commentary – This undeprived triad (Avachakatraya) is caused by the means of true prostration (Satpranama) etc., by the means of the virtuous (Sadhu) etc., by the means of prostration (Vandana) etc., that is the meaning. Understand that it is established in the principle (Siddhanta) at that time. It is established in the principle (Siddhanta). The ultimate cause of this true prostration (Satpranama) etc. is what? For that it is said – “And the lessening of the stain of attachment (Bhavamala) in that way.” That means the lessening of the attachment to karma (Karmasambandha). Just as the dust (Mala) is removed from gems (Ratna) etc., and the activity of light (Prakash) etc. is revealed, so it is said.

## Translation:

**Chitraad: The Cause of the Three Awanchaks is Devotion to the Satpurush**

(15) The three Awanchaks mentioned above, how are they attained? What is the cause of their attainment? This is explained here.  By paying homage, bowing down, offering respect, service, and care to the Satpurush, the true saintly person, the Awanchaks are attained.

The first Awanchak is attained when one encounters the true Sadguru, the Satpurush, the true saint, and offers them homage, bowing down, etc. Through this interaction, one becomes aware of the devotional nature of that person, and thus the Chagawanchak arises.

Then, having recognized their true nature, the homage, bowing down, respect, etc., offered to them becomes the Yiawanchak. And the fruit of such actions towards the true saintly person is unwavering and certain, thus it is the Falawanchak.

Therefore, the root of all this is the pure devotion to the true Sadguru, the Satpurush, who embodies the true path of conduct.

In this way, the attainment of the three Awanchaks is achieved through the excellent cause of the Satpurush. This is firmly established in the teachings of the enlightened ones, in the Agamas. This principle is firmly established, as per the authority of the scriptures. This principle is unshakeable, unwavering, and certain, it will never change.

Can one attain this through the grace of the Satpurush, the Sadguru? Yes, it is through their grace that the soul enters the path of liberation, the path of salvation. This is the state in all three times, and the path to attain the ultimate goal is the same in all three times.

Because, "Vina Nayana ki Baat" - the things that are beyond the reach of the physical eye, but are accessible to the divine eye of knowledge, these things cannot be attained without the grace of the Sadguru. And those who serve at the feet of the Sadguru, they attain it directly.

If one desires to quench their thirst, there is a way to quench it, and that too cannot be attained without the grace of the Guru. This is the eternal truth. And in this way, the supremely knowledgeable person has spoken:

"Without the grace of the Guru, one cannot attain the things beyond the reach of the physical eye.
Serve at the feet of the Sadguru, and you will attain it directly.
If you desire to quench your thirst, there is a way to quench it.
Without the grace of the Guru, it cannot be attained. This is the eternal truth." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

"If the Sadguru grants the ointment of knowledge, one sees the ultimate treasure.
The eye of the heart beholds the Lord of the Universe, whose glory is like Mount Meru." - Shri Anandghanji

And when does one receive the benefit of the company of such a true saintly person, the true Sadguru, who embodies devotion? When does this excellent "G" become possible? The reason for this is also explained here: When... 

Page #232:
---------------------------
(166)
- When the collection of yogadristi (yogic vision) and bhavamala (emotional impurities) becomes less, then it "g" (soul) escapes. - When bhavamala is washed away and becomes one, then such an opportunity is found. When such "punya pandur (merit) is revealed", then the association of a virtuous person happens. "Now the master serves that presence, whose merit is revealed" (Yashvijayaji). Just as the luster of a gem shines brighter as the dirt is removed, similarly, as the inner dirt of bhavamala is removed from the soul, its ability to attain dharma (righteousness) shines brighter and brighter, and the inner light of the soul shines brighter and brighter.
"The soul should repeatedly think about the causes that are obstacles to well-being. It should repeatedly think about and eliminate those causes, and without following that path, well-being cannot be attained. Mal (dirt), viksep (distraction), and ajnana (ignorance) are the three defects of the eternal soul. By obtaining the words of a wise person and thinking about them appropriately, ignorance is eliminated. Simplicity, forgiveness, the same as the father's fault, aparabh (non-attachment), and alpaparigrah (minimal possessions) are the means to eliminate mal. Extreme devotion to a wise person is the means to eliminate viksep."
- Shrimad Rajchandra Patranka 368 (449) Thus, as the soul becomes pure by removing the dirt, its ability to attain the right path increases, and attracted by that ability, it gets the opportunity of a virtuous person in the form of a good cause. The meaning is that as the soul removes its impurities, it increases its ability to attain the right path, and by serving and worshipping the best causes like the sadguru (true teacher), it attains that path. - "Those who are impure are wandering, when the pure cause plays on the soul, then the doer takes the house... Shri Simandhar." - Shri Devchandraji
To support the natural object, he says in a way that emphasizes the difference:
नास्मिन् घने यतः सत्सु तत्प्रतीतिर्महोदया।
किं सम्यग् रूपमादत्ते कदाचिन्मन्दलेोचनः ॥३६॥
Vritti - O ignorant people, this bhavamala, dense and strong, therefore, because, towards the good people, tatpratiti (its perception). (When this bhavamala is dense and strong, then there is no perception of the good people). What kind of perception is it? For that, it is said - mahaday (great compassion), abhyudaya (progress) etc. are the means of achieving it, so it is mahaudaya (great progress). From the opposite object, the same meaning is said - who can take it in the right form? - complete with characteristics, expressions, etc. The meaning is that a person with weak vision, like a blind person, cannot see it because of his weak senses. 

Page #233:
---------------------------
When there is a strong attachment, there is no true faith.
(167) These were true, as perceived by the wise.
Would a person with weak eyes ever perceive the true form? 36
Meaning: When there is a strong attachment, there is no true perception of the person. Would a person with weak eyes ever perceive the true form?
Explanation: The above statement, which says that when there is a lack of attachment, one attains the best opportunity, is further strengthened here by negation (Negative Affirmation). When there is a strong attachment, there is no true perception of the person, no faith or belief. As long as the soul is filled with inner impurities, there will be no faith in the saint. As long as the soul is burdened with guru-karma, there will be no recognition of the virtuous person. Such perception and inner faith are truly life-enhancing, leading to continuous progress. This is supported by an analogy: A person with weak eyes, who sees things dimly due to a visual defect, cannot see the true form of things. Similarly, a person whose emotional eyes are not open due to strong attachment cannot truly recognize the form of the person, nor can they perceive it. Thus, "true faith in a virtuous person will not arise until the intellect is sharp, because a small twig cannot touch the branch of a tall tree."
Now, in support of the main point, the author says:
अल्पव्याधिर्यथा लोके तद्विकारैर्न बाध्यते ।
चेष्टते चेष्टसिद्धयर्थ वृत्त्यैवायं तथा हिते ॥ ३७ ॥ .
Meaning: Just as a person with a minor illness, whose illness is almost gone, is not affected by its symptoms, such as itching, etc., in the world, so too, what? He acts, engages in activities like royal service, etc., for the sake of achieving his desires, for the sake of maintaining his family, etc. This is an example. This is an explanation because it is said:
"Pṛucitra - by virtue of the activity, by virtue of the activity that describes the Dharma. And this - vrutti: śraddhā suvivīdriṣā vijñarita dharma nāṁ: " - this is from the above verse. That is, dhiti, śraddhā, suvivīdriṣā (intense desire to know, curiosity), and their knowledge are the sources of Dharma (they are the birthplaces of Dharma, the places where Dharma arises). Therefore, it is only by virtue of this purposeful activity that this yogi, like a person with a minor illness, acts in the interest of (engages in) giving, etc., due to the suppression of the inactive vrutti.
* "All together, quickly, with great intensity! - This is the path to great happiness, the path to great glory, conquered by Śrī Yaśovijayajī." 

Page #234:
---------------------------
(168)
Just as a man, affected by a minor ailment, is not hindered by his ailment, so too, this (yogi) acts for his own benefit, driven by the desire for the good.
**Yoga-drishti-samuccaya**
**Meaning:** Just as a man with a minor ailment is not hindered by his ailment in the world, and acts for the sake of achieving his desired goal, so too, this (yogi) acts for his own benefit, driven by this (yogi) attitude.
**Analysis:**
The above statement, which spoke of the diminishing of many emotions and the attainment of unwavering attainment, is now reconciled here by means of an analogy, that is, by the method of positive affirmation. In it, first, this example is presented: There is a man. He has recovered from a serious illness. His anger is almost destroyed. He has almost recovered. Only minor ailments like itching, etc., remain, but these minor ailments do not bother him much, do not bother him much, and do not hinder his royal work. And this man, who has a minor ailment and has almost recovered, acts for the sake of achieving his desired work, such as royal service, trade, etc., for the sake of the sustenance of his family.
In the same way, this yogi, who has the attitude of a friend, acts for the sake of achieving his desired goal, driven by the yogi attitude. This attitude is the birthplace of dharma and adharma, the mother who gives birth to dharma. And there are four such attitudes: (1) patience, (2) faith, (3) desire to know, (4) inquiry. This yogi, who has the attitude of a friend, is capable of these four types of attitudes. Therefore, he first has patience in the work of dharma, he has patience. He takes firm patience until death in the shelter of the Lord's feet; he does not become discouraged and impatient even if the fruit is not immediately obtained; because he has firm faith that the fruit of this devotion to the Lord, etc., is certainly attainable, therefore, it is appropriate to strive for its practice. Being a man of such faith, he has a special desire to know the true nature of the self, he has a desire to know. And motivated by such curiosity, he inquires of the true teacher to know, and thus he attains special knowledge through inquiry. Thus, this great seeker yogi is born with such auspicious attitudes, which are like the mother of dharma.
Since these auspicious attitudes are possible here, this yogi, like a man with a minor ailment, firmly suppresses these yogi attitudes, overcomes evil and inauspicious attitudes, and acts for his own benefit, influenced by the auspicious attitudes, and acts for the benefit of his soul, doing auspicious deeds that lead to the welfare of his soul. He gives as much as he can, observes good conduct, etc., and the welfare of all beings. 

Page #235:
---------------------------
**Friend's View:** The last stage of **Yathapravruttikaran** is characterized by **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**).

(169) "May all beings be free from suffering! May all faults be destroyed! May all people be happy everywhere!" This is the auspicious sentiment that arises. Because the **yogi**'s **bhavamala** has become very thin, almost washed away, just like a person recovering from illness, who has almost fully recovered, does not have any minor complaints, which do not hinder their work, similarly, the **yogi** with minimal **bhavamala** does not experience unbearable afflictions, which do not hinder their **atma-hita** (self-beneficial) actions. Therefore, they inevitably cease from harmful activities and engage in beneficial activities. Thus, through **anvaya-vyatireka** (affirmation and negation) and **hakara-nakara** (positive and negative) arguments, it is established that **alpatva** of **bhavamala** leads to the attainment of the **avachka-tray** (three types of liberation).

To further illustrate this, it is said:

"In the final stage of **Yathapravruttikaran**, due to **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**), all these things arise for those whose **granthibheda** (bondage) is near." (38)

**Meaning:** In the final stage of **Yathapravruttikaran**, due to **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**), all these things arise for those whose **granthibheda** (bondage) is near.

**Commentary:** "This **avachka** yoga, it manifests in the final stage. For the **sadhu** (saint), it is like the state of **siddha** (perfection), while the mind of others is still wandering." (Shri Gadh Sakzaya 2-14)

When do all these things mentioned above arise? They arise in the final stage of **Yathapravruttikaran**. What is the reason for their arising? It is due to the **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**). Who experiences this? It is experienced by the **sant** (saint) whose **granthibheda** (bondage) is near, close at hand. Thus, in the final stage of **Yathapravruttikaran**, when the soul has almost completely shed its **mala** (impurities), the **jiva** (soul) whose **granthibheda** (bondage) is near, experiences all these things mentioned above.

**Summary:** In the final stage of **Yathapravruttikaran**, characterized by **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**), the **jiva** (soul) whose **granthibheda** (bondage) is near, experiences the attainment of the **avachka-tray** (three types of liberation). This is due to the **alpatva** (minimal **bhavamala**) which allows the **jiva** to cease from harmful activities and engage in beneficial activities.

"All-knowing, the **pati** (master) of the **naras** (humans), the **bhutakalas** (past) are known to him.
He knows all things everywhere." (Shri Brihat Shantistava) 

Page #236:
---------------------------
(170)
**Gadasthi Samuchaya (1)** When the **bhavamala** (karmic matter) gradually diminishes and **tathabhavyatva** (the state of being worthy of liberation) matures, the soul, in its final **pudgalav** (state of existence), receives the **gabij** (seed of liberation). (2) The soul, existing in the final **pudgalav**, receives three **avachka** (unwavering) factors as auspicious signs for receiving the **gabij**: **gavachka** (unwavering faith), **kriyavachka** (unwavering action), and **falavachka** (unwavering result). (3) These **avachka** are obtained through **pranama** (prostration) and other acts of reverence towards a **sapurusha** (perfect being) and **sadguru** (true teacher). (4) The purpose of these **pranama** and other acts is to diminish the **bhavamala**. (5) This diminishing of **bhavamala** leads to the attainment of the final **yathapravrittikaran** (right conduct). (6) Upon attaining the final **yathapravrittikaran**, the soul approaches **granthibhed** (breaking of the karmic bonds).

Thus, as the internal **mala** (impurities) and **bhavamala** gradually diminish, **tathabhavyatva** matures, and the soul enters its final **bhav** (existence). At this point, the internal impurities are further purified, and the soul, having attained the final **yathapravrittikaran**, reaches **granthibhed**. As the impurities are removed, the soul, recognizing the true **santpurusha** (saintly person), performs **pranama** and other acts of reverence. This leads to the attainment of the auspicious signs of **gavachka**, **kriyavachka**, and **falavachka**. As the impurities are removed, the soul's worthiness and eligibility increase, its faults are eliminated, and its mental state becomes pure, preparing it for the reception and cultivation of the **gabij**. The **gabij** is then received, and the soul's vision opens up.

**Chhogiraj Anandghanji** experienced this in his own life:

"When the final **karan** (cause) is at its peak, and the maturity of **bhavparinati** (liberation) is reached, the impurities are removed, and the vision opens up, the attainment of **pravachan** (discourse) and **vak** (speech) becomes possible."

**Figure 7: Gabij**

**Bhavamala**
* **Gabijgyata**
**Tathabhavyatva** is at its peak
These three **avachka**
* **Pranama** etc.
Final **yathapravrittikaran**
- **Granthibhed** ++ **Bhavamala** is minimal
**Apuurvakaran**

Or, this final **yathapravrittikaran** is "**apuurva** (unprecedented), hence it is said...

**Mitrādaṣṭi:** The last yathāpravṛttakaraṇa is indeed apūrva.
(171)  Apūrvāsannabhāvena vyabhichāraviyogātaḥ | Tattvato’pūrvamevedamiti yogavido viduḥ || 39 ||  Due to the proximity of the apūrva, and the absence of vyabhicāra, this last yathāpravṛttakaraṇa is indeed apūrva in essence, as the knowers of yoga understand.
Commentary:  This last yathāpravṛttakaraṇa, which is mentioned, is close to the apūrva, and therefore, it is apūrva, as the knowers of yoga say. Because there is never any vyabhicāra in it, no deviation, that is, after the last yathāpravṛttakaraṇa, it comes according to the rule of apūrva, therefore, in essence, it is apūrva, that is, never attained before. To explain the cause is the method of justice. This apūrva yathāpravṛttakaraṇa has never been attained by this jīva before, from time immemorial. This apūrva ātmavilāsa has never come before, this apūrva avasara has never been obtained, but it has been obtained now in this daṣṭi, therefore, it is appropriate to call this last yathāpravṛttakaraṇa apūrva.
Here, the jana of guṇasthāna says:
Prathamaṁ yadguṇasthānaṁ sāmānyena upavarṇitam | Asyāṁ tu tadavasthāyāṁ mukhyamanvaryogataḥ || 40 ||  The first guṇasthāna, which is described in general, is the main one in this state, due to the yoga of the meaning.
Vṛtti:  Prathama - first, āgha, first, guṇasthānaṁ - the guṇasthāna, the guṇasthāna called mitrādaṣṭi, is described in general, from the word "nideridī sāsāyārū". Lakṣya tu tavasthā - in this state, mukhya - the main one, nirupacharita. Due to what reason? Because - gavarthātaḥ - due to the yoga of the meaning, due to the yoga of the word that follows the meaning (in the true meaning of the word). Due to the feeling of such a guṇa - due to the feeling of being, the guṇasthāna is established, therefore (the name guṇasthāna is given). | Jīta Mitrādaṣṭi II. 

Page #238:
---------------------------
(172)
**Gadashtisamuchchay Meaning:** - The first Gunasthan that is described from the general, in this state, it is "primary" according to the word "Anvath Yeg".
**Discussion:** This has suggested which Gunasthan is in the first Dristi named Mitra. The first "Gunasthan" named "Mithyashti" in the Shastra, is the main one here. So, in the state of this Mitra Dristi, the true first "Gunasthan" falls in the true sense of the word - Nirupcharitapan. Because the place of origin of the Gunas is called "Gunasthan". And where the Gunas of the primary state are present, it is truly called the first "Gunasthan". The beginning of the attainment of such Gunas starts in the first Dristi, the auspicious moment of entering the Agmarg is this first Dristi, this is the auspicious beginning of the eligibility for the Sanmarg, this is the first step of the liberation from the cycle of birth and death, this is the first role of the great G-prasad, this is the first attempt to climb the G-mountain. Thus, primarily, i.e., Nirupcharitapan, the first Gunasthan is present in this Dristi.
Even before this Dristi is attained, all Mithyadristi are counted in the first Gunasthan, but they are Upcharitapan, secondary - not primarily. They have the name of Gunasthan, but not truly. Because the manifestation of the Guna is not there, the place of the Guna is not there, so according to the true meaning of the word, it is not Gunasthan, it is just a name for the sake of saying it is Gunasthan. Thus, there is a lot of difference in both types, it is the distance between heaven and earth. Just as a person is called "King", and a real King who has royal power, there is as much difference between the two, as there is between the first Gunasthan without the previous Guna and the first Gunasthan with the Mitra Dristi, which is full of Gunas.
And here, in the Mitra Dristi, even though Mithyatva has not yet been avoided and Samyaktva has not been attained, yet what wonderful excellent Gunas are manifested here, it has been discussed in detail above. Because we have seen that the self-absorption of this world is very far away in Mitra. By meeting the Guru, the attainment of the age of unwavering Guna-attainment is achieved. His mind becomes pure, it becomes wet with the irrigation of Vairagya, and seeds are deposited in it. He manifests pure devotion towards the Supreme Being, he performs the best worship of the Guru, and he performs various worship of the Sat-Shastra. He becomes the abode of auspicious Gunas like compassion, non-hatred, love for virtue, service to people, etc. And having attained such a state of activity, he is standing close to the breaking of the knot. Thus, with the emergence of many Gunas - manifestation, this Yogi has got "the time of fame and splendor", he has got "an unprecedented opportunity" for the attainment of excellent fame.

## Friend-Vision: Essence

(173)
If one deeply contemplates these qualities and examines their own soul, they may find that these qualities are not present within them. Even if they are present, those who consider themselves to be of the sixth stage or of the stage of samiti are likely to be misled by their self-examination, which is filled with errors and false beliefs. The path to Samyagdristi is still very long, but has the journey even begun? Has the first step been taken? Has the first stage even been reached? This is the essence of the quality of Friend-Vision! One must contemplate this from the soul, and strive to attain these qualities and enjoy the bliss of liberation as soon as possible!

**Explanation:**

* **Friend-Vision:** A state of mind characterized by seeing all beings as friends, free from hatred and with a non-violent attitude.

The attainment of avachakra, the attainment of auspicious omens from avachakra, and from that, the attainment of chag-bija, etc. - this is the causal chain here.
*
And all this arises in the last pudgala-vatta, in the last yatha-pravritta-karana, which is a-purva - when there is a scarcity of bhavamala, and the jiva has come close to granthi-bhed. This last yatha-pravritta-karana, which is a-purva, is truly a-purva from the perspective of the paramanu. In such a mitra-shti, according to the true meaning of the word, the first gunasthana, which is the main one, exists.

**Kalasha Kavya of Mitradrishti and Yogadrishti**

One who is not affected by raga (attachment) etc., does not kill any living being, thus not committing suicide.
One speaks the truth, does not utter falsehood, does not steal, and practices celibacy.
One does not have any attachment to possessions, and does not indulge in greed. 17. One who is a friend of the yogi, sows the seeds of liberation in the mind.
These seeds grow and bear the fruit of liberation, just as a banyan seed grows into a large tree.
Such a person becomes a benefactor of the future, just as a seed of a shiva tree bears fruit. 18. Here, the yogi has devotion and love for the Lord.
He worships the Lord, sings hymns and praises his virtues.
With a pure and selfless heart, he bows down to the Lord, forgetting all other thoughts and focusing his mind on the Lord. 19. One who is content with the self, has devotion for the guru, the true teacher, and the saints, the avadhutas, and the munis.
He has pure devotion for all of them in his body, mind, and speech.
He is always eager to serve them. 20. Through birth, death, sorrow, old age, anger, and grief,
This world seems unreal.
One desires to be free from this house of suffering.
One is inspired by the fear of suffering and desires liberation. 21. One gives charity, does not accept gifts, and serves the saints.
One dedicates his body, mind, and wealth to the welfare of the world.
One gives medicine and other help to the suffering, the poor, and the helpless.
One performs good deeds with a pure heart and enjoys the fruits of his actions. 22. One reads and writes the scriptures with devotion.
One listens to the scriptures and understands their meaning.
One reveals the meaning of the scriptures to others.
One spreads the message of the Lord in the world with a pure heart. 23.

When the Yogin hears the story of this seed,
He immediately accepts it with faith and enthusiasm; and towards it, he develops pure devotion,
Truly, this is a great and auspicious act of merit. 24. When the subtle delusion of the cycle of births and deaths is destroyed,
When the last particle of matter comes to an end; then, in the human realm, this seed is sown,
Where else can one find such a great opportunity to act? 25. Seeing the suffering, the compassionate one's heart melts with compassion,
He feels the pain of the father, and is filled with mercy; seeing the appropriate qualities, he serves everyone,
This is considered to be the last and most glorious act in the cycle of births and deaths. 26. Then, he receives auspicious omens. Good,
So that the seeker may receive the guidance of the true Guru; the fruits of his actions will not be lost,
He will attain the goal of liberation, like an arrow that is aimed at its target. 27. When the internal impurities are destroyed by serving the saints,
The fruits of the yogic actions are not delayed, one attains such virtues, and the Lord attracts him to the path of liberation, as if it comes to him naturally. 28.
Sowing the seed of liberation, it will bear the fruit of liberation in the future; it brings one closer to right faith, and brings joy forever. 29. "Having attained the art of the yogic seed, this Kirat Chandra,
The Lord attains perfection, Haribhadra, the great sage. 30. ॥ इति महषि श्रीहरिभद्राचार्यविरचिते किरत्चन्द्रसूनुमनःसुखनंदनेन भगवानदासेन सुमनानंदनीबृहत्टीकानामकविवेचनेन सप्रपञ्चं विवेचिते श्रीयोगदृष्टिसमुच्चयशास्त्रे प्रथमा मित्रादृष्टिः ॥

## Tara Deshți

Now, Tara Deshți is being discussed. Thus, it is said:

"In Tara, the vision is clear, and the rules are of that kind. There is no anxiety in the beginning of good deeds, and there is an inquiry into the nature of truth." (41)

**Commentary:**

"Vision in Tara Deshți...mind like cow dung fire...mind..." - S. - 1

This second vision, called Tara, is somewhat clearer than the first, Mitra Deshți. It is compared to the fire of cow dung.

**Explanation:**

"Tara ya - in Tara Deshți, what? It is that - the vision is somewhat clear. Nichen tathavidha - and the rules are of that kind, like cleanliness, etc.; rules like desire, etc., also exist. Cleanliness, contentment, austerity, self-study, and devotion to God are the five rules. 'ShaunasampatY:vadhyaye ghaliana tti: - based on this saying. Therefore, here, there is also understanding from the second yoga, but in Mitra, there is a lack of this - due to the lack of destruction and cessation of that kind. Tatha bana hitar - in the beginning of the good deeds of the other world, there is no anxiety. In the beginning of the good deeds related to the other world - in the activity, there is no anxiety, it is free from anxiety. Because of this, there is its achievement. Tatha nijgnasa taravavara - inquiry into the nature of truth. Inquiry into the nature of truth - the desire to know - is the consequence of this. (Non-hatred comes first, so the inquiry comes after it, in accordance with it.) 

Page #244:
---------------------------
(178)
The yogadristi samuccaya (collection of yogic vision) is somewhat brighter, more stable, and clearer than the fire of cow dung and tinder. Similarly, the knowledge of this vision is also somewhat more detailed and precise than the previous one. However, it is almost like the vision of a friend, only the quantity is different. Just as the fire of cow dung cannot show the true form of the desired object, this vision cannot show the true nature of the self, etc., which is the desired object of the bound element - the ultimate reality. It only gives a faint idea, because the fire of cow dung does not last long, it is extinguished in a short time. Similarly, the knowledge of this vision does not last long enough to be properly practiced. The light of the fire of cow dung is dim and faint, similarly, the light of knowledge of this vision is also weak and feeble. The fire of cow dung is extinguished in a moment, it does not remain stable. Similarly, here too, the knowledge with weak power does not leave a firm memory imprint, so there is no skillful and expert memory at the time of action in life. And thus, because the light of the fire of cow dung is very weak, it is not possible to achieve any true object-like work through it. Similarly, because of the weakness and inferiority of this vision, acts of worship, etc., do not happen from the heart, they are only material acts of worship, etc.

Similarly, this is the second yogadristi. Therefore, according to the rule mentioned earlier, it has (1) the second limb of yoga, niyama, (2) the renunciation of the other defects, anug, and (3) the attainment of the virtue called jijñāsā.

1. The second limb of yoga: niyama "Shaucha, santosh, and tapas are good...mind is absorbed in the meditation of Ishvara...mind is established in the five niyamas...mind" - Dasha Shray - 2, -1
After the attainment of the first limb of yoga called yama, the second limb, niyama, is attained here in sequence. The yamas like ahimsa, etc., are to be observed as long as the jiva lives, and the niyamas are for a limited time, for a certain fixed time. 'Niyama: parimitaaso vaavjiä chamo priyate |' (Ratnakaranda Shravakachar). For example, swadhyaya, tapas, etc., are for a certain fixed time, they are not for the entire life of the jiva, therefore they are called niyamas. There are five main niyamas: (1) shaucha, (2) santosh, (3) tapas, (4) swadhyaya, (5) Ishvara pranidhana. And due to their intensity, they are of four types according to their level - ichchha niyama, pravritti niyama, sthira niyama, siddhi niyama.

1. Shaucha - means purity, cleanliness, holiness; it cleanses the mind,

**Tārādṛṣṭi: Another Gang-Rule, Definition of Śauca**

(179) To purify the inner self, to remove inner defilement, that is true Śauca. Some people consider water to be Śauca, which is not correct. Therefore, it may be that the body is cleansed of dirt, Śauca = inner purity, and even that is not truly possible, because the body itself is a mine of impurity, a receptacle of impurity. Even if it is bathed in water as vast as the ocean for thousands of years, it will not become pure! Even fish, poor things, stay in water for twenty-four hours! Similarly, no matter how many pilgrimages one takes, Śauca is not achieved. This external Śauca is not presented here, but rather internal Śauca is desired.  The spiritual Śauca in the form of purity of thought, which is Śauca like water, etc., may amaze the foolish, but not the wise. Because -

Oh! Foolish beings bathe once, bathe again, bathe a third time, and so on, they bathe again and again in pure water and anoint this body, which is the seat of excrement, with sandalwood and fragrant substances; and now they consider themselves pure and become attached to it; but in reality it is not so. That body never becomes pure. Can a receptacle of excrement ever become pure? It never does.”

Śrī Mansukh Bhai K. in his work, Śāntasudhāras Vivecan, does not give much importance to this external Śauca, considering its limited nature. His vision is primarily directed towards inner purity. He bathes in the water of meditation, in the purity of the lotus, in the form of emotional bathing. He bathes in the pure peace of Brahmacharya, which is the holy pilgrimage within the Dharma, and becomes pure and spotless, renouncing faults and becoming cool.”

“ध्यानांभसा तु जीवस्य सदा यच्छुद्धिकारणम् ।
કરું í સાબિચ માઘસ્નાનં તદુ ”—Śrī Haribhadrasuri's Aṣṭaka “Dharma Jaganātha ne Dharma Śuci Gāīe, Āpane Ātmā Teha Bhāviye.” “Par Pariṇati Raj Ke, Nirmal Siddhi Varant.”—Śrī Devacandraji x" शौचमाध्यात्मिकं त्यक्त्वा भावशुद्धयात्मकं शुभम् ।।"

Narāśira, who is a wise person, explains this truth to the foolish – Umaśvātiji in his work, Vācakavaryaśrī. *" स्नायं स्नायं पुनरपि पुनः स्नांति पुण्याभिरभ्दिः वारंवारं बत मलतनु चंदनैश्चर्चयंते । मूढात्मानो वयमपमला प्रोतिमित्याश्रयंते । नेो शुद्धयंते कथमवकरः शक्यते शोध्धुमेवम् ॥"
–Śrī Vinayavijayaji Mahārāj's Śāntasudhāras + “ धम्मे हरए बंभे संतितित्थे, अणाइले अत्तपसन्नलेसे । - Poet or Poet, Murati Mūro Pagāmi San Chhe? –Śrī Uttarādhyayana Sūtra " आत्मा नदी संयमते।यपूर्णा, सत्यावहा शीततटा दयार्मिः। તત્રામિણે પાડુપુત્ર ? – Vāṇi Śudrathati Cātarātmā II” –Śrī Mahābhārata,

While the collection of *gadashti* may be somewhat useful for householders and others, the insistence on external cleanliness is entirely *mithya*. The true *shauch* is to cleanse the inner self of the *parparinaati* (external influences) as much as possible and to reveal the pure nature of the soul, which is *shuchi*, *nirmal*, *pavitra*, and *shuddha*. This is the true *shauch* that is acceptable to all saints.

Or, *shauch* is *nirlobhata* (non-attachment). This too is a form of inner purity, because *lebha* (attachment) is said to be the root of all sins. As *labha* (gain) increases, so does *lebha*. This is stated in the *Shri Uttaraadhyaayana Sutra*.

"Cha ta roho." Therefore, limit *lebha* as much as possible. *Shauch* = *nirlobhata* is to bring *lebha* under control. To desire the possessions of others, to be attached to *parparinaati*, to be greedy for the things of others, these are the signs of *lebha*. As one gives up the color of *parparinaati*, the *shauch* of *nirlobhata* is revealed. As the desire for the possessions of others diminishes, so does the *shauch* of the soul, its purity and holiness, and inner purity increases. Thus, both are one and the same.

Or, *shauch* is *pramaanikta* (honesty). A honest person will not touch the possessions of others, nor will they even think about them. They can understand everyone, young and old. Therefore, to not even touch the possessions of others is *shauch*. If one has mistakenly taken the possessions of others, to return them and demonstrate honesty is *shauch* in the form of honesty. As the contact with the possessions of others and *parparinaati* diminishes, the quality of *shauch* increases. Thus, these three definitions are one and the same.

"I am more attached to the *parbhaav* than myself, I am a *bhakt* *pudgal* (devotee);
The *kaarak* (doer), the *kaarak* (doer), the *graahak* (receiver), I am attached to them, I am the *jad* (inert) *bhaabhoop* (king of the world)...*Namiprabha* 0 - *Shri Devchandraji*

"The mine of urine and feces, the abode of disease and old age;
Considering the body as such, abandon pride and make it meaningful." - *Shrimad Rajchandraji*

These are the fruits of *shauch* (purity): (1) *Swaangajugupsa* - When one considers the form of the father's body, one sees its impurity, therefore, one feels disgust and aversion towards the mine of urine and feces, one feels repulsed, and this body is impure. Therefore, there is no attachment, pride, or insistence on duty in it. (2) *Anyairasangama* - Not being in contact with others.

**The Accumulation of Fourfold Vision**

The measure increases. As the soul, freed from the objects of the five senses, becomes satiated with attachment, it continues to detach itself from attachment, and thus experiences the peace of self-satisfaction. Therefore, the seeker of liberation, the yogi, who possesses this vision, desires to attain this satisfaction-bliss, which is independent of the soul.

**3. Austerity**

Austerity is that which is practiced for the destruction of karma or for the purpose of purification. Or, that austerity which makes the soul shine in its own form, which makes it extremely radiant, which makes it shine with its own inherent brilliance, is called 'austerity'. Just as fruits like mangoes ripen quickly due to heat, so too karma ripens quickly and is destroyed by the heat of the fire of austerity. There are many types of austerity, but the main division is this: there are six external austerities, such as fasting, and six internal austerities, such as atonement and self-study. External austerity is beneficial to internal austerity, it makes it conducive, it is a helpful cause. Because when there is fasting, etc., many external distractions are eliminated, the mind remains pure, it does not become distracted, and there is an opportunity to engage in self-study, devotion, etc. Even in fasting, etc., one should renounce the objects of attachment, one should not indulge in sleep, eating, playing, etc., one should constantly focus on the growth of internal austerity, and one should strive to dwell in the self as much as possible. Only then can it truly be called 'fasting'. Otherwise, it is merely a formality!

**X**

**D**

"My knowledge is like a red-hot iron, burning with attachment;
He who experiences that equanimity, that taste, is filled with wisdom." - Shri Devchandraji

**D**

"Where the renunciation of the objects of attachment is prescribed,
That is fasting, say the wise." - Shri Mokshamarg Prakash

**K**

"Where there is renunciation of the passions, meditation on Brahman, and on the Jina,
That is pure knowledge, that is the best." - Shri Adhyatmasar

Thus, external austerity strengthens internal austerity, it removes the obstacles to its practice, therefore it is essential, but not in a mechanical way; rather, it should be done with understanding, with knowledge.

**66**

"The wise man, having controlled his senses, remains steadfast in his knowledge.
His knowledge is established in the objects of the senses." - Shri Gita

**"C**

"That which is practiced for the destruction of karma is called austerity."

"Austerity is born from the self." - Shri Amritchandracharya

##  The Increasing Radiance of the Ascetic

(183)  Knowledge should guide actions, always mindful of one's limitations. Only then does it become beneficial.  Otherwise,  excessive austerities, driven by ego or mere show, like prolonged fasts, or ignorant practices like mass-feeding,  do not alleviate the suffering of birth and death.  As the scriptures say, "An ignorant person, even after years of austerities, cannot exhaust karma, while a wise person can do so in a single breath."  Physical austerities alone are childish and ignorant.  Therefore, knowledge is essential for true benefit.

"One who endures hardship, practices restraint, and mortifies the body, but lacks knowledge, will not escape suffering." - *Savaso Gatha*

"The weak, the naked, and the fasting, but those who are still attached to Maya, will continue to take countless births." - *Sa. 2. Ga. St.*

The true austerity is internal.  *Swadhyaya* (self-study), *Prayaschitta* (atonement), *Vyaavachch* (discernment), *Vyutsarg* (renunciation), *Vinaya* (humility), and *Dhyana* (meditation) are the six types of internal austerity.  These have many sub-categories.  Through these, the inner self is purified, karma is shed, and one attains purity.  Just as fire refines gold, removing impurities, so too, knowledge-based austerity refines the soul, removing internal impurities.  Austerity leads to the destruction of *kleshas* (afflictions) and other impurities, resulting in the attainment of physical and sensory perfection.  "Austerity leads to the perfection of sleep, energy, and purity." (*Pa. 2-43*)

As this knowledge-based austerity intensifies, the soul radiates like the sun.  It becomes serene and cool like the moon.  Thus, it attains the great *Mangal* (auspicious) state.  The ascetic then becomes worthy of the salutations of the wise, a *Buddhi* (intellect).  With increasing radiance, they become a *Nigantha* (Jain) *Jnata* (knower) *Siddhi-data* (bestower of liberation), a *Guru* (teacher).  Or, they become a *Shukra* (Venus), radiating with the full power of the soul.  Then, the diseases of the body, mind, and speech become weak like *Shani* (Saturn).  Finally, they attain liberation, moving towards the ultimate state of *Swaroop Siddhi* (perfection of form).

This is the unparalleled glory of austerity.  This is the sentiment that Shrimad Rajchandraji has beautifully depicted in *Moksha Mala*, in his unique style.

"An ignorant person, even after countless births, cannot exhaust karma, while a wise person can do so in a single breath." - *Shri Yashvijayji* - *Shri Adhyatma Saar*

The collection of Gadasthi says, "Papdhyane becomes like the sun, achieving that, remain steady and help; the great one attains the auspicious line, then he bows to Budhan. The certain knower, the guru, the Siddha, the giver, or the self-fulfilled Shuk, well-known; there, the Trig attains only the weak, the form-Siddha wanders and rests."
4. Swaadhyaaya-Sakzaya, with Pranava, the mantras; or reading, contemplation, and deep study of the scriptures, to investigate is Sakzaya. To study the essence of the self, to contemplate is Swaadhyaaya. I am the pure consciousness-essence soul, completely different from the body and all other things, to remain in that self-awareness, to abandon the self-consciousness in the body, to abandon the body-consciousness, and to have self-consciousness in the soul, that is the best kind of Swaadhyaaya. Or, to read and think about spiritual texts that strengthen that self-awareness; to sing, praise, and chant in a state of detachment and devotion; to ask questions to resolve doubts; to give Dharma-katha-vyakhyan, as if teaching the soul of the father without ego, to cultivate the feeling of detachment - these are the types of Swaadhyaaya. Through Swaadhyaaya, one sees the desired deity. Swaadhyaayadidevatasam: " (Pai Tho 2-44).
"Read, contemplate, and investigate the scriptures, the spiritual knowledge, the path, the purpose." - Shri Anandghanaji "By cultivating the self-awareness, the soul attains Kevalgyaan."
5. Ishwarpranidhaan - to focus the mind on the Supreme Soul, Parameshwar, to contemplate is Ishwarpranidhaan. To connect the mind with its form, to merge the mind, to become one with it, is called Ishwarpranidhaan. Ishwar is the one in whom knowledge and other infinite powers have emerged, manifested, who has become the master, the lord, the Ishwar of the infinite soul-essence. The pure Siddha soul who has attained the supreme state of Paramatmapada, that is Ishwar.
"That Ishwar Dev, who has his own wonderful Ishwarta;
The power of disappearance, manifests and reveals all." "Whose infinite Dharma has manifested, who is the ultimate perfection; Paramatma Jindev here, the ocean of knowledge and other qualities...Swami! I request with a loving mind."
- Shri Devchandraji To do pranidhaan of such a Paramatma-Parameshwar who has attained that state, to contemplate with a focused mind is Ishwarpranidhaan. Then, that Ishwar may be known by many names like Prabhu, Jin, Ahanta, Shiv, Shankar, Buddha, etc. Because, despite the difference in names, there is no difference in meaning. It is enough that there is the Ishwar-ness with the true qualities. That Ishwar-ness is worthy of worship, no matter what name it is called. For example -

There is no rule for the collection of Gadashti, because there is a lack of such क्षपशम. That is, in the previous view, the previous view has merit, but in the previous view, the previous view does not have merit.
2. "Anudveg nahi kirya udveg re....Manmohan mere." - Gadashti 2
Similarly, here, the other mental defect called Udveg is avoided, and Anudveg is present. That is, in the work of self-interest, in the work of achieving the interest of others, there is no anxiety, boredom, or dislike. Even while sitting, the name of the dislike-absence that arises towards something is Udveg. (See page 85) That is, the man with Udveg gets up from that yogakriya - he runs away, and perhaps he has to do the action forcefully, like a royal order, he hurriedly finishes it, quickly finishes it! On the contrary, this man with this view has Anukreg. There is no anxiety-dislike towards Dharma Kriya, there is no hatred towards the means of attainment, so he does not take a bribe in Dharma Karya, he does not do what he has to do forcefully even though he does not want to, like a king's order, he does not quickly finish Dharma Kriya! He does not join his hands to God, he does not put two or three piles of rice, and he does not leave! But he has supreme love for that yogakriya-dharma kriya. He knows that this Dharma Kriya that I want to do is for my own self-welfare, I want to avoid the suffering of the cycle of birth and death through this yogasadhan. Since this is the case, the yogakriya priti, the muumukhu purush, does every Dharma Kriya with supreme joy, with indomitable enthusiasm and peace. He does Prabhubhakti with devotion, with supreme love. He serves the Sadguru-Sapurusha with supreme respect and humility. He listens to the scriptures with attention. He does Samayik, Pratikraman, etc. with proper purity. And this muumukhu yogi has this Anug with Akhed. Because only when there is Akhed, then Anudveg comes, so the defect of Khed that is removed in the first view, is also the same here. Thus, this yogi purush does not feel regret or fatigue while doing Dharma Pravritti.
3. Tattvajijnasa, the other quality called Jijnasa is revealed here. Jijnasa means the desire, eagerness, and anticipation to know the truth. To develop a desire to know the nature of the truth, to feel a longing, is true Jijnasa. The knowledge that is without true Jijnasa is superficial. 

Page #253:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Tārādṛṣṭi tattvajijñāsā, vegakathāprīti**
(187) Does not enter the heart. This vision reveals true tattvajijñāsā to the seeker. Just as the chatak longs for the clouds, just as the thirsty man looks around for water, so this seeker longs to know the truth, a longing arises, a thirst develops. Like a traveler on a dusty road in the summer, parched and yearning for water, crying out "water, water," so this thirsty soul yearns for tattvadarśana. This intense thirst for truth arises in this inquisitive person, leading to many natural questions. Such as:

"Who am I? Where did I come from? What is my true form? What attachments do I have? Should I keep them or abandon them?" -  "Śrī Mokṣamālā, the thirst for nectar, why drink poison?
Congratulations, Jin darśana, the best." - Śrī Ānandghanajī

When this true thirst for truth or tattvadarśana arises, the way to quench it is also revealed. If that thirst does not arise, why would one want to quench it? And how would one find the way to quench it? The supremely capable tattvavettā, Śrīmad Rajacandraji, has said in very poignant and moving words:

"One who wants to quench thirst, I am the way to quench it; without the Guru's grace, this eternal state cannot be attained."

"The thirsty one should make the effort, the non-thirsty one should be made thirsty. For those who cannot be made thirsty, remain indifferent." - Śrīmad Rajacandra

This quality of jijñāsā arises only when the quality of adveṣa has first manifested. Therefore, in accordance with the adveṣa quality that first manifested in this vision, this jijñāsā arises. Jijñāsā is the subsequent result of adveṣa. This jijñāsā has a desire to know the true nature of reality, but it does not have the stubbornness of a father who is absolutely right. Thus, in this vision:

"Darśana in your vision... captivating, like a fire that consumes everything... purity of mind, contentment, and austerity are good... the mind is attracted to devotion... the five rules are fulfilled in the mind... the mind does not desire action... the mind has the quality of jijñāsā for truth... the mind does not cling to its own stubbornness..." - Sajāya, 1-2

This vision also mentions the other qualities that are present:

##  Gadasthi Samuchaya

**Verse 42:**

In this दृष्टि (drishti), there is an unbroken, intense love for the वेगकथा (vegakatha) and respect for the pure योगी (yogi) due to their adherence to the नियम (niyam).

**Explanation:**

This दृष्टि (drishti) is characterized by two main qualities:

1. **Unbroken love for वेगकथा (vegakatha):** The योगी (yogi) who embodies this दृष्टि (drishti) has an unwavering, deep love for stories related to योग (yoga). This love is unbroken because they are deeply connected to these stories, their heart resonates with them, and their mind is drawn to them. They find a deep and lasting connection to these narratives. What are these वेगकथा (vegakatha)? They are stories about मोक्ष (moksha) or the ultimate reality, which is also known as योग (yoga). Therefore, any story about the means to achieve मोक्ष (moksha) is a वेगकथा (vegakatha).

2. **Respect for pure योगी (yogi):** This दृष्टि (drishti) also involves respect for pure योगी (yogi) who follow the नियम (niyam). This respect stems from their adherence to the principles of योग (yoga) and their dedication to the path of liberation.

**Commentary:**

The commentator states that this दृष्टि (drishti) is characterized by a deep love for वेगकथा (vegakatha) and respect for pure योगी (yogi). This love and respect are essential qualities for those who seek liberation.

**Note:** The commentary mentions two types of योग (yoga): साधक योग (sadhak yoga) and सिद्ध योग (siddha yoga). साधक योग (sadhak yoga) refers to the practices that lead to liberation, while सिद्ध योग (siddha yoga) refers to the state of liberation itself. The commentary also mentions the different stages of liberation, from the first दृष्टि (drishti) to the final दृष्टि (drishti). 

Page #255:
---------------------------
**Tārādṛṣṭi:** Four types of Dharmakatha, pure yogi's reward for each.
(189) That is sādhaka yoga. The peak, the final limit of sādhaka yoga is siddha yoga. In siddha yoga, all karma is destroyed, the complete, blissful, natural form is revealed, the fullness of the inner qualities is achieved, and the yogi becomes absorbed in the self and plays in the self-form.*
Wherever there is any statement related to such sādhaka yoga, or wherever the story of a man who practices such yoga is being told, the seeker with this vision experiences supreme joy and supreme love flows. Similarly, four types of attractive Dharmakatha that attract towards the good, seem sweet like nectar to him. Dharmakatha is there. He listens with interest to the vikṣepaṇa katha, which creates distraction towards the bad. He likes very much the sanvega katha, which shows the bitterness of the results of karma and creates a desire for liberation. He likes the nivega katha, which shows the bitter results of sinful karma and creates detachment from the world. In short, wherever the story of self-welfare is being told, wherever the nectar of pure devotion is being consumed, wherever the glory of the virtues of the true Guru is being sung, the soul immerses itself in supreme love. Because he knows this self-beneficial yoga katha to be extremely rare. He knows that in this world, the story of wealth, the story of desire, is very common. He has heard the story of wealth and desire countless times, he has been familiar with it countless times, he has experienced it countless times. But he has never heard, never been familiar with, never experienced the story of liberation, the story of speed, the Dharmakatha, which is the means of liberation. Knowing this, why would he be interested in such a poisonous story? And why would he not have supreme love for the supreme, rare yoga katha, which is like supreme nectar? "Jin guna amṛtapāna thi mana amṛta kriyā suprasāya re...bhavi.
Amṛta kriyā anushṭhāna thi mana, ātama amṛta thāya re...bhavi." - Shri Devchandraji "Girua re guna tum taṇā, Shri Vardhamāna Jin rāya re,
Suṇatā śravaṇe amī jhare, mahārī nirmala thāye kāyā re." - Shri Yashovijayaji * * Upshama bhāva he miśra kṣayikapaṇe, je nij guna prāgabhāva;
Pūrṇāvasthāne nīpajāvte, sādhana dharma svabhāva...svāmī svayamprabha ne jāuṁ bhāmaṇe. Samakita guna thi he śaleśī lage, ātama anagama bhāva:
Sanvara nirjarā he upādānaheta, sādhālambana dāva...svāmī Shri Devchandraji * "Sudparicidāṇubhūda savvasa vi kāmabhogabandha kaha.
Pracārakuve mā navara ja guru vittaraṇa" - Shri Samyasāra

2. If one has great respect for pure conduct and also for the stories of the Yagas, then it is no surprise that they would have even greater respect and reverence for the Yogis who embody the Yagas, who have attained pure conduct. Those who are truly dedicated to the path of liberation, who are true ascetics, will surely respect those who are devoted to the path of conduct. They will have the utmost respect for those who have achieved complete mastery of conduct and have become Siddha Yagas. Their soul will bow in devotion to anyone who is in a higher state than them, who has a higher level of virtue. If they see someone who is more virtuous in any group of ascetics, a stream of love will flow through their heart.

Natural Expression of Devotion:
Whether they are a seeker, a soul on the path, a person with right vision, a true listener, a devotee, a teacher, a guide, a practitioner of conduct, a liberated being, or a perfected being, they will have the utmost reverence for all of them. From the depths of their being, a natural expression will emerge:

"Namo Arihantaṇā!" - Salutations to the Arihantas!
"Namo Siddhaṇā!" - Salutations to the Siddhas!
"Namo Ayariyāṇā!" - Salutations to the Aaryas!
"Namo Uvvajjaayaṇā!" - Salutations to the Upadhyayas!
"Namo Hoksasārupa!" - Salutations to the ascetics!

- Salutations to the Acharyas!
- Salutations to the Upadhyayas!

The Collection of Yogic Vision:
- Salutations to all the ascetics in the world!

"The ocean of peace, the noble of ethics,
The fire of knowledge, the treasure of meditation;
The pure intellect, the celibate, the mouth full of love,
The benefactor of all, the garden of Dharma;
Free from attachment and aversion, supremely pure,
The mind filled with virtues, equal to the virtuous;
The patience of Rayachandra, the shield of Dharma against anger,
O Muni! You are ahead of me, my salutations to you." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

It is not just this respect, but also...

**Tāraṣṭi:** Service to the true ascetics according to one's capacity, the fruit of the increase of the vow.

**Yathāśaktyupacāra ca yogavṛddhiphalapradaḥ | Yogināṁ niyamādeva tadanugrahadhīyutaḥ || 43 ||**

Service according to one's capacity, which gives the fruit of the increase of the vow. It is due to the rule of the ascetics that they are endowed with the mind of grace. (43)

**(191)**

**Meaning:** And service according to one's capacity, which gives the ascetics the fruit of the increase of the vow, and which is endowed with the mind of grace towards them.

**Commentary:**

The noble ones do... the mind sees its own cave... the mind"—This is the pure vow of the ascetics, the ascetics who have advanced in the path of the vow, they are not only to be honored inwardly, but that honor should be made meaningful, put into practice, made practical, and there should be service from them according to their capacity, as much as they can. Therefore, this powerful service, the seeker of liberation, performs service to the true noble ones with humility, as much as he can; he gives them pure food, drink, and medicine with due respect; he gives them the scriptures and other things that are beneficial; he serves them with true devotion in times of need, such as illness, etc.; he is always ready to make all arrangements so that these great saints can worship without any obstacles.

Because he knows that these true devotees are indifferent to their own bodies, they are free from attachment, these renunciates have renounced all external influences and are indifferent, these Nigrantha ascetics, who are immersed in their own bliss, are only taking on the body for the sake of self-control, they do not have any other desire.

**Vṛtti:** Yathāśaktyathāśakti, according to the appropriateness of one's capacity, according to the appropriateness of one's capacity, what? It is the service of the world, the procurement of food, etc., and this is the process towards the aforementioned ascetics, there is a continuous relationship. It is a special characteristic of this—yo vṛddhiphalapradaḥ—which gives the fruit of the increase of the vow, due to its proper result; yogināṁ niyamādeva—only by the rule of the ascetics. Otherwise, it would not have the intended purpose. (This service to the pure ascetics, the ascetics give the increase of the vow only by the rule of the vow, it would not have the intended purpose.) Tadanugrahadhīyutaḥ—endowed with the mind of grace towards them. Endowed with the mind of grace, of benefit, towards the one who provides the service. (The one who performs the service thinks that I am doing good to my own soul, this is the grace of the true guru.) 

Page #258:
---------------------------
(192)
There is no collection of Gi-drishti; it is the duty of a seeker to serve such completely detached great souls, it is the unparalleled benefit of life, whatever we offer at their feet is less, because they are the ultimate benefactor. Knowing this, he offers the flower petal of service that is possible from the father - "I will fulfill the vow" - with devotion at their lotus feet.
"What should I offer at the Lord's feet? Everything is inferior from the soul; it is given by the Lord, I am at the feet of the Lord. From this day onwards, this body is at the Lord's feet.
I am a servant, I am a servant, I am a servant of the Lord." Shri Atmasiddhi and such virtuous devotees, this service-duty, which is full of respect and humility, gives the seeker the fruit of the growth of yoga qualities. In which, like a single seed sown in the best field, becomes a giver of infinite fruits by tradition, so the service of such virtuous saints gives infinite fruits,
It becomes the cause of the soul's progressive growth in Dharma - the real "gain of Dharma". The benefit of selfless service gives itself the reward of growth, and therefore, I am doing a favor to my father's soul by serving this soul-peaceful, virtuous person, I am doing a favor to my father's soul, the servant should definitely feel this way. From this, the understanding of self-grace should arise in me that I am saving my soul from the ocean of the world. Thus, in this view, the yogi should respect the pure yogis, and serve them as much as possible, and that too with the understanding of grace of the father's soul.
This treatment is given a special name -
लाभान्तरफलश्चास्य श्रद्धायुक्तो हितोदयः । क्षुद्रोपद्रवहानिश्च शिष्टसम्मतता तथा ॥ ४४ ॥
Other benefits are also there, this is full of faith;
There is no trouble, benefit arises, it is also acceptable to the virtuous. 44, this attitude - devoid of hypocrisy - and the giver of treatment, due to the merit of pure treatment, which has other benefits, there is a feeling of consequence of that kind. Therefore, - full of faith - this treatment is full of faith, there is a continuous relationship. Hito: - in which there is the rise of benefit, as before. Shudropadravaanich - and there is the loss of petty trouble. Therefore, there is the destruction of diseases etc. Shishyanakshtaata tatha tatha prakaare shisammata, the acceptance of the virtuous, therefore, this has very beautiful respect. 

Page #259:
---------------------------
## Vasadrusti: Other Benefits from Sant Seva

(193) The meaning and the treatment, which gives other beneficial fruits and is full of faith, is beneficial. And in it, there is the harm of Shudra Upadrav and the agreement - acceptance of the Shishtajana.

**Discussion:** The treatment or service dharma mentioned above is also special, what kind of special qualities it has, it is said here, in this way, the service of a virtuous person with true feelings, also gives other beneficial fruits. Because, through his service yoga-mahima, there is the attainment of punya-daya, and from its result, there is the attainment of other beneficial fruits like Surapati-Narpati wealth, etc. Just as there is a support behind the jar, just as there is the attainment of a flower before the fruit, similarly, along with the fruit of the increase of service, there is the attainment of punya-paripaca, which is an incidental fruit like Indra-Chakravattapad, etc. Because, "He is the best Kalpavriksha, the supreme Chintamani Ratna, the chief among all religions, the self-grasp of Siddhi", what fruits are not attained from him? Thus, like the Kalpavriksha, this service dharma towards the Santjana, who gives desired benefits, is full of faith. Because, what is the use of thought without pure faith? Therefore, this Mumukshu serves the virtuous person with faith.

And this is full of faith, therefore, this Mumukshu Yogi-jana's interest arises. That means, he is engaged in the work of self-interest, self-welfare, and his art is increasing in it. Just as the rising sun becomes more and more radiant, just as the moon in the Shukla Paksha attains increasing art day by day, similarly, this soul, the man, attains more and more powerful self-interest, interest follows interest from tradition.

"Shukla Beej Shashi Reh, Teha Puran Huve Lal" - Shri Devchandraji, therefore, he suffers from Shukla Upadrav. That means, small, insignificant troubles like Aadh, Vyadhi, Upadhi, etc., do not harass this being, do not trouble him. Where the preparation for the destruction of the great trouble in the form of birth is going on, then these small troubles are insignificant. "He is the best Chintamani, the supreme Chintamani Ratna, the chief among all religions, the self-grasp of Siddhi" - Shri Gabindu. "Yamah Sonamudhar, Nivrudhiniyan, Kshadviteeya Ya Chamano Yathra -a Dwa..."

(194)
Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
How can such trivial nama-la upadravas (trivial disturbances) trouble him? Where even elephants are swept away in the turbulent flow of a river, what is the weight of a trivial straw?
And such a mumukṣu (aspirant) has samatā (equality) towards the noble ones, and this is a very beautiful honor. That is, he always considers the noble ones to be of the highest standard, he considers their words - their commands - to be of the highest honor, he places them on his head; and he receives honor through their samatā.  Shiṣṭa (noble) refers to those who are supremely learned, well-educated, panditas (scholars), who are masters of the scriptures, who are sādhus (holy ones), and who are agreeable to such people. One who has received the pure teachings of ātma-dharma (the dharma of the soul) properly, whose heart is firmly imbued with the pure samskāras (impressions) of satya-dharma (true dharma), who is skilled in the discernment of tattva-tattva (truth-truth), is called a pandita, and therefore, such sat-janas (good people) are considered to be samatā - acceptable, such satpuruṣas (good men) are called "shiṣṭa". Such shiṣṭa-janas (noble people) consider such a yogi with this vision to be highly honorable, and he becomes very honorable.
Thus
•
*
Bhaya nā tīva bhava kṛtya-hāni na cocite | Tathā nā bhoga-to'pyuccaina cāpyanucita-kriyā || 45 ||
Meaning: Such a yogi does not have excessive fear of bhava (existence), nor does he have kṛtya-hāni (loss of action) in what is proper, nor does he have anucita-kriyā (improper action) even unknowingly.
Commentary
Bhava-bhaya
Such a yogi with this vision does not have excessive fear of bhava (existence), he does not have much fear of the world; because he does not engage in ashubha (inauspicious) actions, therefore he remains free from fear. Only those who do bad or wrong deeds, who engage in ashubha (inauspicious) conduct, who are wicked and sinful, have fear, even a fool knows this. Moreover, such a man, free from attachment, engages in shubha (auspicious) activities like prabhu-bhakti (devotion to the Lord), guru-bhakti (devotion to the guru), etc., therefore he also attains special fearlessness. Because he is absorbed in the devotion of the Lord with pure feelings, and he takes refuge in the Lord's feet with the feeling that - O Lord! O most merciful God! I am the recipient of infinite faults, yet by your grace I have made this vast ocean of existence like a puddle. Although I have a great enemy
Vṛtti: - Marcha nā tīva bhava-dva - bhava-janya - samsāra-janya atyanta bhaya hotā nāthi - , tathā-prakāre ashubha-mā aprāvṛtti-ne līdhe (ashubha pravṛtti kare nahi, tethi samsāra-nā dar pan lage nahi). Tyāni-ne chete - and sarvāṁ j ucita-mā mṛtya-hāni na hoy, dharṁ ādar-ne līdhe. Tathā-nā-mo-te'vyuvaiva -  temaj anā-bhoga-thi panu, - ajāṇatāṁ pan atyanta-ne, ne vāvyanucita-kriyā - savatra j anucita-kriyā pasu na hoy. (Ananutaṁ pan anucita-kriyā kare nahi.)

"Taraashti: Dhee'go Dhany Maathe Fiya Re', Uchit Katt Vy" (195)

"He is still deceiving me, and I am still foolishly mingling in worldly affairs. But now I have found a master like you, so I believe that my fear of rebirth has been averted. O Vitarag Dev! I have drunk your essence-alchemy, and with devotion I have enshrined you in my heart, so I feel that my worldly passions have subsided. O Lord! By seeing you, my sorrows and misfortunes have vanished, and I have attained happiness and prosperity. After I have taken a master like you 'on my head', how can even my hair become crooked?"

:

"Sorrows! Burning flames have been extinguished, happiness and prosperity have been bestowed; a master like you is on my head, who can make me fall?" - Vimlajina! - Shri Manadghanaji

"He who has made the world, which is like an insurmountable ocean, as easy as a pond, I have taken him as my Lord, I have mingled in worldly affairs... Lord. But now I have found a master like you, my fear of rebirth has been averted... Lord. But now there is no fear, the King of Jinas has come, I have drunk the essence-alchemy... Lord. O Knower of Hearts! Lord, by enshrining you in my heart, my worldly passions have subsided... Lord." - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, this seeker of liberation is fearless and bold, due to his detachment from the inauspicious and his engagement in the auspicious. And he does not suffer any harm in performing the right action, he does not allow any flaw to occur in the right Dharma-duty that is worthy of being done; because he performs the worship of the feet of the Jinas with utmost devotion, he has great affection for the company of the monks, he observes the power of restraint as appropriate, he gives charity, he cultivates good conduct and morality, he practices austerities, he cultivates good thoughts, and he does not allow any flaw or deficiency to occur in them. He considers all beings as his friends, and he strives to remain non-violent in thought, word, and deed as much as possible; he speaks the truth, which is beneficial, moderate, and loving; he remains honest and just, and he stays away from the desire to steal or covet the property of others; he maintains a motherly-like view towards other women, and he becomes content with his own wife, or he completely observes celibacy; he strives to make his possessions and acquisitions appropriate, he sets limits on his possessions. He takes refuge in the pure Dev, the pure Guru, and the pure Dharma; he abandons all other nets. He abandons all dark tendencies and embraces the sattvic tendencies. Compassion, peace, equality, forgiveness, truth, renunciation, detachment - these sattvic tendencies are always alert in the mind of this seeker of liberation. 

Page #262:
---------------------------
(196)
Yoga-darshan-samuchaya: "Worship of the feet of the Jina, with extreme devotion, companionship with the munis, delight in the extreme, restraint, yoga, and its components. Compassion, peace, equality, forgiveness, truth, renunciation, detachment; these are always awake in the heart of the seeker." - Shrimad Rajchandraji
Pure support, with love, abandoning other desires, abandoning the tamasic tendencies, worship the sattvic qualities...peace.
- Shri Anandghanji
And thus, this seeker, just as he does not fail to perform his proper duties, he also does not perform improper actions. Knowing and understanding, he does not even kill the smallest of living beings,
how then would he kill the larger dust-like beings? Even unknowingly, he does not wish to harm any living being, knowing this, how would he even act improperly towards anyone's feelings? He does not even wish to speak falsely in his dreams, knowing this,
how would he break his promises? For whom is the sin of earning wealth unjustly and dishonestly, for whom is it a burden? He who thinks this, how would he even desire to steal another's property? Seeing the faults of wealth loss, loss of honor, and suffering, etc., that arise from adultery, etc., directly, how would he even look at another woman with lustful eyes? He who desires to escape from the trap of attachment and acquisition as soon as possible, why would he lay down a long bed for himself?
Thus, this seeker, who no longer has any fear of the world, performs proper actions and does not perform improper actions, because he is like a simple, obedient servant, who bends as he is told. "He does not perform improper actions, his mind bends as it is told." - Shri Rog Sazaay 2-3
Thus -
In actions that are greater and greater, there is a desire for knowledge.
In equal actions, there is fear, but without hatred. ||46||
Explanation: - In actions, like meditation, etc., in greater and greater actions, - in actions that are greater than the role of a father, - in actions that are greater than the learned, like the actions of an acharya, etc., there is a desire for knowledge, a desire to know how this is so. With a desire for knowledge, that is, with an excess of desire. (Seeing the greater actions of someone who is greater than a father, there is a strong desire to know how this is so). In actions that are equal, like worship, etc., in the actions of one's own father, who is flawed, due to negligence of duty, etc., there is fear in the mind. There is great fear in the mind that I am harmful. Without hatred, - this fear is without hatred, due to the strength of the present perspective. (Even though both actions are equal, seeing the father's actions as flawed, there is fear in the father's actions, and there is no hatred towards the one who is more virtuous) 

Page #263:
---------------------------
**Tāraṣṭi:** Intense curiosity towards one who is highly virtuous.

In the actions of one who is more virtuous, a desire to know the reason for their actions, and a lack of aversion towards one's own shortcomings. 46
(197)

**Meaning:**  There is a desire-filled curiosity towards the actions of one who is more virtuous, and a lack of aversion towards one's own flawed actions.

**Commentary:**

Furthermore, in this ṣṭi, the aspirant, seeing the actions of an ācāryādri who is more virtuous than themselves, and who has a higher state of self-realization, thinks to themselves: "Ah! This great soul's actions are of such a superior kind, what kind of curiosity is this, how does it happen?" This gives rise to a state of intense desire and anxiety-filled curiosity to know the reason; because the states of the soul are countless, and due to the speed of the karmic actions, due to inferiority, due to being less, there are countless differences in the states of the soul. Thus, due to the difference in the destruction of karma, some souls are of a lower order than themselves, some are of the same order, and some are of a higher order. Thus, there are differences in the states of souls who are progressing, moving forward, and achieving self-development. Therefore, their religious actions are also of that kind, with varying degrees of speed, and are of a higher or lower level.

In this, the aspirant, when they see great souls who have a higher state of self-realization than themselves, when they see a bhavacārya, a bhavupaādhyāya, a bhavasādhu, a bhavasrāvaka, or any other aspirant who is more virtuous than themselves, they are filled with wonder. When they see their dharma-dhyāna, which is more pure and blessed than their own, when they see their firm and unwavering faith, which is more steadfast than their own, when they see their devotion to God, which is more filled with joy and enthusiasm than their own, when they see their tapas, svādhyāya, pratikramāṇa, vandanādi, which are more filled with self-exaltation than their own, when they see their ahiṁsā, satya, etc., which are more developed than their own, and when they see their samyagdarshan, jñāna, cāritra, etc., which are more self-perfected than their own, then this aspirant, who has this yogadṛṣṭi, is filled with wonder and thinks to themselves: "Ah! This great soul's dharma-dhyāna! Ah! Their devotion! Ah! Their faith! Ah! Their tapas-svādhyāya! Ah! Their ahiṁsā-satya! Ah! Their darshan, jñāna-cāritra! Ah! Their state of brahmaniṣṭhā! Ah! Their unparalleled self-perfection! How did these wonderful brahmaniṣṭhā great souls attain such a wonderful state of self-realization?"

How could they have achieved such a state of Yoga-drishti-samurchay and self-realization? How could they have performed such extraordinary acts of self-empowerment, being so blessed?
“Blessed, blessed are those men who, in their country, hear the words of the Lord; who perform pure knowledge and action, and experience it themselves.” – Shri Devchandraji
Blessed are those monks who walk with equanimity; who, through the play of the cycle of births and deaths, have crossed over, by the name of restraint and action… Blessed are those who have abandoned the mire of worldly attachments and sit on the lotus, separate from it; who, like lions, are valiant in their own prowess, the support of the three worlds… Blessed are those who are knowledgeable and wise, true in body, mind, and speech; who speak the nectar of the essence of the elements, the true words of the Jinas… Blessed.” – Sa. Trag. St., etc.
In this way, the supreme blessedness of those self-absorbed Mahatmas is perceived, and with a noble affection for virtuous people, one contemplates how such a wondrous state of self-awareness could have manifested in these great souls? A strong desire and curiosity arises to know this.
And this desire for liberation, this true curiosity, arises in these aspiring yogis, not only that, but seeing their own inferiority in the actions of praising the father, etc., like those Mahatmas, they experience extreme torment in their minds, disgust towards their own soul, and hatred towards their father, thinking: “Oh! I, or anyone else, cannot perform such excellent religious actions! Truly! I am a recipient of endless suffering, and not a single virtue is seen in me; because I do not have the pure feelings, or the feeling of the Lord’s form, like these Mahatmas, nor humility, nor meekness, nor devotion to the Guru’s commands, nor steadiness, nor firm faith in the Lord, nor supreme devotion, nor the practice of good company, nor the practice of service, nor the feeling of being only the soul, nor firm faith, nor the feeling of “I am a mere mortal, what can I do?”, nor unwavering attachment to the Lord, nor the heat of separation from the Lord, nor the sorrow for the rare stories of the Lord, nor entry into the path of devotion, nor firm awareness of devotional singing, nor understanding of one’s own religion, nor dwelling in a good country, nor the abandonment of the bonds that are contrary to service, nor the control of the body and senses, nor the sorrow of separation from the Lord, nor knowledge of the scriptures and teachings, nor the attainment of divine vision, nor the rules of Yama and Niyama, nor detachment, nor lack of ego, nor the accumulation of one’s own religion, nor the abandonment of other religions. Thus, in countless ways, I am without means. I do not have a single virtue. What great thing can I show? In the entire world, I am the lowest of the low, and the most fallen of the fallen.”

Tārādṛṣṭi: Dekhe Nij Guṇ Hāṇ
“O Lord! O Lord! What have you said? Dīnānāth Dayāḷ! I am the vessel of infinite faults, merciful! Pure feelings are not in me, nor am I all your form;
There is no inferiority or humility, what can I say about the supreme form. There is no obedience to the Gurudev, firmly in my heart;
Your faith is firm, and there is no supreme love. There is no yoga for satsang, no service yoga;
Only surrender is not there, nor is there refuge in the follower. I am a pauper, what can I do? There is no such discrimination;
There is no refuge in your feet, no patience, until death. Your incomprehensible greatness, there is no passionate feeling;
Not a single part of love, does not get the supreme effect. There is no firm form of attachment, no heat of separation;
The story of your love is unavailable, there is no sorrow for it. There is no entry into the path of devotion, no firm awareness of worship;
There is no understanding of one's own dharma, no place in the auspicious land. Due to the time, the poison of Kali, there is no limit to dharma
There is no anxiety either, see Lord my karma. Whatever is contrary to service, that is not renunciation;
The senses do not believe, they are attached to the external. There is no joy in your separation, no vow, no restraint,
There is no indifference from the unfaithful, so in the house, etc. There is no freedom from ego, no accumulation of one's own dharma;
There is no renunciation in purity, nothing of another dharma. Thus, in infinite ways, I am without means;
Not even one virtuous quality, what face should I show? Only the embodiment of compassion, Dīnbandhu Dīnānāth!
I am a sinner, a complete orphan, O Lord! Hand. The lowest of the low, the most fallen, in the whole world I am
Without that certainty, what will the means do? Falling, falling at your lotus feet, again and again I ask for the same;
The form of the Sadguru Saint, make that firmness.” - Śrīmad Rājacandrajī

The collection of Yogadashti says, "I abandon my own form and play with the pudgala. I reverse and quench the thirst of the object. I make the asrava-bandha-vibhaav my interest. I forget the false abode and blame the dosha on the other...viharmaan." - Shri Devchandraji, etc. In this way, seeing their own faults, and seeing the shortcomings of their father's religious practices, these yogi men with this Yogadashti develop a sense of aversion towards their father. They are relieved of their suffering. How low is this life? How lax is their conduct? How careless are they? How devoid of virtue are they? But this aversion arises, and in it, there is no hatred towards the virtuous. There is absolutely no envy or jealousy. There is no envy or jealousy towards such virtuous men, but only a feeling of joy arises. Not only that, but instead of being disappointed by their father's lack of virtue, they are inspired to move forward by seeing the excellent virtues of great men. Thus, "Vinaya adhik guni ne kare...man dekhe nij gun haan re...man" - 20 Sakzay 2-3
Dukharoopo bhavah sarva ucchedho'sya kutah katham. Chitra satam pravruttiश्च साशेषा ज्ञायते कथम् ॥४७॥ Dukharoopa bhavah sarva aa, kyaanthi kem uche?
Chitra pravrutti santani, kayam janay sahu bhed? 47, meaning - The whole world is full of suffering, how and from where does its destruction happen? And the various, wonderful activities of the saints, how are they all known?
Vivechan traas dhare bhavabhay thaki. Man bhav mane dukhaan re...man" 0 Sakzay 2-4
Furthermore, this yogi man with this Yogadashti considers the whole world to be full of suffering; because birth, old age, death, grief, heat, etc. are full of suffering, this world is full of

The picture of the character of the soul, which is tormented by the eight afflictions, is as follows:

(21)
It is directly seen that the soul is constantly agitated by the three types of heat. It is realized that in this world, which is full of destruction and sorrow, there is only fear, fear, and fear. It sees that there is fear of attachment in wealth, fear of downfall in family, fear of the king in wealth, fear of humiliation in honor, fear of enemies in strength, fear of women in beauty, fear of debate in scriptures, fear of wicked people in virtues, and fear of death in the body. Thus, everything appears fearful to it, and it realizes that only detachment is fearless.

Thus, the whole world is full of fear and sorrow. Whatever is considered to be a source of happiness in the world is also only a semblance of happiness and is actually sorrowful. Even the position of Indra and Chakravarti is sorrowful. This is the firm conviction of the soul. Because:

“Every time there is fear of death, fear of attachment, fear of livelihood, fear of protection if there is fame, fear of avoiding infamy if there is infamy, fear of taking if there is something to take, fear of being indebted if there is something to give, fear of… if there is a woman, fear of acquiring if there is not, fear of the mischief of children and grandchildren if there are, fear of acquiring if there are not, fear of increasing if there is less wealth, fear of losing if there is more, thus, there is experience for every achievement.” - Shrimad Rajchandra

Therefore, the aspirant soul thinks: O soul! You have suffered endless sorrow while wandering in the four states of existence in this fearful world. You have experienced intense suffering in the terrible hell state, the animal state, the ghost state, and the human state. You have endured unbearable suffering for a long time due to the lack of detachment. You have repeatedly experienced physical and mental suffering. O soul! You have lived for a long time in the wombs of many impure, repulsive, and filthy mothers. You have drunk more milk than the water of the ocean. Your mother has shed more tears than the water of the ocean at the time of your death. Your hair, nails, etc., have been cut more than the height of Mount Meru. O soul! This:

“Fear of attachment in wealth, fear of downfall in family, fear of the king in wealth, fear of humiliation in honor, fear of enemies in strength, fear of women in beauty, fear of debate in scriptures, fear of wicked people in virtues, and fear of death in the body. Everything is filled with fear, detachment is the only refuge.” - Shri Bhartrihari

(For this, see - Shrimad Rajchandra's Bhavanamoad). “Whatever is called happiness in this world is all worldly. It is not happiness, but only a semblance of happiness, but undoubtedly sorrow.” - Shri Amritchandracharya's Shri Panchaadhyayee

---------------------------
(202)
The one with yogic vision has traveled through all three worlds, through all places, repeatedly. He has had all kinds of relationships with all beings, many times. He has tasted and discarded all the objects in the universe, again and again. He has consumed the essence of the world, repeatedly, with great enthusiasm, yet he has not attained satisfaction! Suffering from thirst, he has drunk the water of the three worlds, yet his thirst has not been quenched! Therefore, O being! Now you attain peace! Attain peace! "The essence of the world, like a lump of clay, does not diminish your burden, my friend." - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, contemplating the sorrowful nature of the world, the color of detachment arises in his heart. He contemplates, "For what reason, and how, can this sorrowful world be destroyed? I am standing in fear of rebirth. What should I do in this sorrowful, impermanent, and fleeting world? So that I do not go to a state of misery." "I am standing in fear of rebirth, now take me across the ocean of rebirth." (Yashvijayji)

Furthermore, seeing the various virtuous activities of the liberated souls, the righteous men, and the saintly monks, he becomes amazed. Their supreme, wonderful devotion, their supreme, wonderful self-power, their supremely pure, spotless austerity, their supremely excellent religious meditation, their supremely peaceful, solemn conduct, the picture of the saints, their pure activities filled with supreme knowledge, and their character, like a mountain of great restraint! Seeing the virtuous activities of the holy men, like the adornment of green, etc., he becomes absorbed in wonder; and he contemplates, "How can the entire picture and character of these self-contented, Brahman-devotee, great souls be known? Because, when contemplating the character of these righteous men, sometimes they appear compassionate, sometimes they appear sharp, sometimes they appear indifferent! Thus, contradictory qualities are seen in them! Because these great souls possess compassion, which benefits all, they are sharp in severing karma, and they exhibit indifference, which is like the feeling of a witness, without attachment or aversion, to the results of acceptance and rejection! Furthermore, they are yogis and they are also householders! They are speakers and they are also silent! They are the lords of the three worlds and they are also naked ascetics! Thus, various...

"Fearful hell, the animal realm, the celestial realm, and the human realm. ...
You experience great sorrow, O being, with the knowledge of the Jinas. You have drunk all the water of the three worlds, you are suffering from thirst. You should not contemplate the body." etc.
(See) Shri Kundakundacharya's Shri Bhava Prabhriti, *"In this impermanent, fleeting world, filled with sorrow.
I am not yours, I am not attached to you." - Shri Uttaradhyayanasutra 

Page #269:
---------------------------
"**Tāradṛṣṭi**: "Many scriptures, little intellect." (203) Their contradictory picture activities appear! How can the great ones know the entire picture-strange self-efforts of men, which are so amazingly surprising, by the miracle of consciousness?
Compassion, gentleness, sharpness, indifference, cool... cool, all beings' welfare-causing compassion, sharp karma-cleaving; harmless, resulting, indifferent, cool... cool. Power, person, three-world lordship, with detachment, cool... cool. Yogi, together, speaker, silent, useless, cool... cool. Etc. multi-broken, tri-broken, giving miraculous mind, cool... cool. Amazing, picture-strange, taking the treasure of bliss, cool... cool." Shri Anandghanaji, understanding bravery, patience, sharpness, saw the servant's mind pleased; the qualities, by the praise of passion, were amazing, the qualities, by the lack of passion, were alive." - Shri Devchandaji

Because
"Our great intellect, great expanse of scriptures.
Shiṣṭa: "I accept that, in itself, it is 48." We do not have great intellect, and the expanse of scriptures is great; therefore, here, the shiṣṭa is the proof, - this is the view, always believed.
The above discussion said, "All the picture activities of these holy people cannot be known," the reason for that is shown here. Those with this view believe that - we do not have such great intellect that we will never disagree - never fall. And the intellect of the father, having lost to the free-willed imagination, in the subject that is covered, will that disagreement come without a dull mind? It does not remain. Thus, our intellect is very limited - limited in subject,
and the expanse of scriptures is very, very great. The Shruta Sagar, beyond the scope, the name, the intellect, our intellect is not great, it is not argumentative; because, from intellect, in the absence of knowledge, the vision of disagreement arises, therefore. Also - great expanse of scriptures: the expanse of scriptures is extremely great - large - because of the purpose of the activity. Thus - the shiṣṭa - the holy person, the shiṣya puruṣa, who is agreeable to them, is the proof - in this situation - in this occasion. Riti - therefore, thus, with a clear mind - this is the view, always believed. What they have done, it is appropriate to do it as much as possible from the ordinary, that is the meaning.

##  The Collection of Gadasti

Even the great wise ones, the great people, get tired, so what about someone like me, a commoner? How can my beak dive into this? "Infinite gam, paryay, arth, hetu, nay, and shabdrūp! The all-knowing shasan-pur, rich with the wealth of gems, is difficult for the ignorant to enter. Then, I, devoid of the power of shruta-buddhi, who wish to enter without considering my own weakness, am like a beggar who wants to pick up the grains that have fallen! Those who gained knowledge of the twelve angas from the reception of just three padas, those former lion-like men, when we hear of their infinite ocean-like knowledge, even the knowledge of the present-day men, called 'agamdhar-shruta-dhar', who are not even a point, is not within my reach, where is the place for someone like me, with a dull mind, in that?"

"The sutras, in which there is an ocean of nectar, are very sweet,
Where the strong waves of the siddhant rise; the confluence of the beautiful river of yukti,
Who is capable of describing this beautiful shruta-jalnidhi? Even the mind of a wise person cannot follow its path,
Where the intellect of the wise people is never obstructed; seeing which, the mind becomes attached to the multitude of virtues,
Who is capable of describing this beautiful shruta-jalnidhi?" - (Day. Bhagwandas) Thus, with my defeated mind, I cannot cross the vast ocean of scriptures, therefore, it is appropriate to accept the words of the saints here. What they have said should be considered true, what they have practiced should be practiced by the common people as much as possible, their words are the only thing that is desirable and respectable to my mind; therefore, it is not appropriate for me to lie or deceive myself. "Mingno chen jat: sa pracha:" - It is my duty to follow the path that the great people have shown, and by doing so with devotion, I will surely achieve fame. *

"Although it is difficult for even the learned to enter the city of the all-knowing shasan, which is adorned with infinite gam, paryay, arth, hetu, nay, and shabdrūp, like gems.

This Tārādrṣṭi—
(1) Darśīn, like a weak ember of cow dung, with a weak state of being. Hi. (2) The second limb of the fourfold path, niyama, is present. (3) The abandonment of the second mental affliction, called udvega. (4) The second virtue, called jijñāsā, manifests.
In addition to these, this group of virtues is also present: (1) Supreme love for the stories of the yagis. (2) Respect for pure yagis, their care as much as possible. Therefore, there is a rise in devotion, the destruction of petty disturbances, and conformity to the righteous. (3) Escape from the fear of rebirth. (4) Proper conduct, improper misconduct. (5) Curiosity towards those who are more virtuous. (6) Regret and suffering due to one's own lack of virtue. (7) Dispassion for the world, a desire to be free from it. (8) Wonder at the exemplary conduct of the righteous. (9) A feeling of "what the righteous say is the standard," abandonment of self-will.

With pure, selfless love,
All growth, blossoming, and fitness, yoga finds,
Contentment, even this moment, not swayed by the waves of desire.
Within the soul, constantly dwell, contented, emotional color;
Limit, that possession, by rule, constantly brings,
Desire's pit, difficult to fill, know, contentment enjoys.
Right knowledge, equipped, austerity, austerity, what power, this glorious one,
And in the soul, by austerity's power, this powerful ascetic;
Good scriptures, contemplation, this study, meditation,
Body contemplation, there, chant, chant, with soul-like feeling.

Such true, divine qualities, mind's concentration is established,
Singing, meditating, worshipping, soul's awareness is attained.
Yoga desires not, dislikes not, takes, not pride,
But in it, day by day, devotion, joy increases;
Who am I? What is my form? Knowing, essence,
- With longing, thirst to quench, like the chatak,
Gold, nectar, like stories, are pleasing,
Know them, rare, mind dwells in them;
Desire, etc., poison-like stories, mind does not stick,
All have tasted, again and again, have gathered, even a particle?
True yogis, great ones, who have pure devotion,
Towards them, constantly, constantly, much devotion, respect increases;
Service, with humility, do, what power, with devotion,
And the soul, grace, in the mind, thus meditate.

Tashdristi: Yogadristi Kalash Kavya
Therefore, he receives Suphal in the form of Gavrudhi,
Many others also get Anushangi Anupi; Kalyan's rise increases, Han Upadrani,
The Shist wears the Aana on his head, he is a Sajjani. This Mumukhu is very afraid of Bhava,
"Dhigo Dhni" on his head, the Lord makes his hair crooked; He does not allow any deficiency in that act,
He does not know what is inappropriate, he does it uselessly. High Gasthitimay Dasha, Dharta Gini,
Look at the high action, he wants to know, he wants to see! He thinks about the wealth of the saints, the hatred goes away,
And seeing the father's Vikal Karani, the association goes away. The whole world seems like a heavy sorrow,
For what purpose? From what Rauta will the Tas rise? How will these various good deeds of the saints be known?
This Mumukhu longs for this very much. I do not have the intellect, the vastness of the scriptures,
Therefore, here, the Maticalpana-rupa Swachched Shist, the true Satjanamata is the proof in every way,
Believing this, the mind always remains in the Del, not in the Dafan.

## Bala Dristi

Bala Dristi is also called Tara Dristi. Now, it is called "Ala", so it is said here.

**"Sukhasanasamayuktam balaayaan darshanam dridham | Paraa cha tattvasushrushaa na kshepo yogagocharah ||49||"**

**Meaning:** In Bala Dristi, the vision is firm, combined with a comfortable posture. There is a supreme desire to listen to the truth, and there is no distraction in the path of yoga.

**Commentary:** The third Dristi is called Bala, like a burning log, there is no distraction, it is combined with a posture, and there is a search for listening to the truth.

**"Jinji! Dhan dhan tuj upadesh." - Gadh Sakzaye Ru-1**

The third Dristi called Bala, according to the previous sequence, has these characteristics: (1) Vision is like a burning log, (2) the third limb of speed is posture, (3) the third intention fault called distraction is abandoned, (4) the third virtue called listening is attained.

**"Kritti-Suhasanmaayu-Sukhasanathi samaayukt, sthira sukhasanavaala, varaayaan-bala dristima, -darshan, purve kahiyu hatu te (sat shraddhale che te darshan), dridh-dridh-kasht agnikana ni upmawaalu che etla mate.

**Meaning:** In Bala Dristi, the vision is firm, combined with a comfortable posture. It is like a burning log, as mentioned before. There is a supreme desire to listen to the truth, and there is no distraction in the path of yoga.

## Bahastthi: Like a Fire of Wood, the Third Limb is Asana

**(209) 1. Darshan:** Like a fire of wood, the knowledge is strong. In this view, Darshan, meaning steadfast faith, is a bond that is stronger than the previous two views, more firm, and unique. It is likened to the light of a fire kindled from wood. A fire of wood is brighter, more stable, and longer-lasting than a fire of grass or dung. Similarly, this view, my friend, has a stronger, more stable, and more powerful knowledge than the previous two views. Therefore, when it manifests in action in life, it has a sharp and skillful memory, because its impressions last longer. Consequently, even a slight effort is possible due to the mere liking for the experiment of the soul, meaning the manifestation of meaning. Thus, there is a firm and strong Darshan in this expectation. Therefore, according to the characteristics of the word "Dristidarshan" mentioned earlier, here there is a strong faith in the Purusha and the words of the Sapurusha, the scriptures. And with such faith, the bond is also stronger. Therefore, the seeker with this view is a devoted servant of the Sapurusha, the true Guru, and a steadfast devotee of the true scriptures. Therefore, he engages in activities that are in accordance with the true scriptures, refrains from unrighteous activities, and draws closer and closer to the path of righteous action.

**2. The Third Limb of Yoga is Asana:** Here, the third limb of Yoga, Asana, is attained. It is a comfortable and stable posture, a firmness of posture. After attaining the first two limbs, Yama and Niyama, in the previous two views, a firm Asana is naturally attained here. Because, as the firmness of Yama and Niyama increases, as Yama and Niyama become ingrained in the soul, the soul establishes a firm and comfortable Asana on the path of liberation, it sits firmly, it becomes stable.

Here, apart from external postures like Padmasana, Paryakasana, etc., it is important to understand the internal Asana. This soul has been sitting in the posture of attachment to the external world since time immemorial, considering the external world as its own and sitting on top of it! To rise from this immemorial attachment to the external world and sit in the posture of the father's true nature, to take a seat in it, is the comfortable posture for the ultimate purpose. Along with this, the practice of external firm postures is also helpful and supportive in removing the restlessness of the mind and body, because when the soul sits still in one place, its mind becomes calm, and it becomes conducive to Dharma-meditation. Asana. 

Page #276:

(210)
With the steadfastness of yogic vision, obstacles are conquered. * Dualities are not affected, and the defects of the senses are abandoned with dedication.
This "Sukhasana" word is worth understanding. "Sthisuutvanatam" (Pa. Tho2-46). Sukhasana is that which is stable, where one can sit comfortably and at ease.
A stable posture that does not cause anxiety is Sukhasana. An asana that is unstable, where one cannot sit comfortably and at ease, is not called Sukhasana. Just as a chair with a shaky base, broken or cracked, is not called Sukhasana, but one with a stable base, a beautiful, unbroken cushion is called Sukhasana; similarly, in the ultimate reality, in the language of spirituality, the posture of a thing that is unstable, shaky, and painful to sit on is not Sukhasana, but Dukhasana! True "Sukhasana" is a state of one's own natural self-nature. Because it is extremely stable, not shaky, and brings supreme joy when sitting, it is the ultimate Sukhasana in the ultimate reality. As the soul sits in such a state of Sukhasana, waves of happiness and supreme bliss emanate from it. Thus, as much as possible, to abandon the contemplation of the body and become absorbed in the soul, is the achievement of the third limb of the asana, called "asana".
"Let go of the contemplation of the body, you are not the doer, you are not the devotee, that is the dharma." - Shri Atmasiddhi
"Atmabuddhi, he Kayadike remained, Bahiratam Aghrup... Sugyani Kayadike he Sakhidhar became, Antar Atmarupsu" - Shri Anandghanji
3. The "Kshepa" named citta-dosha, which was mentioned in the third akshepa, is abandoned here, because after the removal of the two doshas called kheda and udvega in the previous two dristi, this dosha also disappears. First, kheda, which is the mind's lack of steadfastness towards yogic practice, is removed. Then, the udvega dosha, which is the aversion or dislike towards yogic practice, is removed. And then, naturally, the "Kshepa" dosha also disappears. Kshepa means to throw away (from kshidhatu). To throw the mind here and there, to run around, is called kshepa. While doing anything, the mind gets distracted and wanders here and there.
"Atosantarayavijayo dwandvanabhihatistatha | Doshaparichayah kanidhanapur:sar: || " - Shri Yoga-Krita Dva Dva
"Tatanamighatah" - Shri Patanjali. Su 2-48

**Bahadashti:** "Akshep, mandu kihi na bane"
(211) What is gone is gone. Just as there is no fruit from sowing seeds that are repeatedly uprooted and replanted, similarly, there is no pure fruit from actions performed with a mind that is constantly distracted and running around. (See page 85).
This state of a wavering mind is called *kshep*. When this *kshep* fault is abandoned, it is called *akshep*. This unwavering mind, free from distractions, is the essence of the soul; a distracted mind is the delusion of the soul. Knowing this, the yogi, with this vision, keeps his mind unwavering as much as possible, not allowing it to become distracted. Whether he is performing *pratikraman* or *samayik*, whether he is engaged in devotion to the Lord or paying homage to the true Guru, his mind does not wander elsewhere, it does not become distracted and go towards other things. He does not act like the merchant who went to the market while performing *samayik* -
There was a householder. He was sitting in *samayik*. In the meantime, his mind wandered, and he started thinking about going to a certain leather merchant, a *chamar*, and talking to him about this and that! And he even started muttering to himself! His clever daughter-in-law heard this. Someone came and asked if the merchant was at home. The daughter-in-law replied, "He is not at home, he has gone to the market!" After the *samayik* was over, the merchant asked his daughter-in-law, "I was at home, why did you say I was not?" The wise daughter-in-law replied, "Father-in-law! Your body was at home and you were sitting in *samayik*, but where did your mind go, to the market?" Hearing this, the merchant realized his mistake and felt remorse for the fickleness of his mind.
This seeker, as much as possible, draws his mind back from external influences, because the impressions of ignorance are being removed from him, and he is acquiring the impressions of knowledge. Therefore, passions, aversions, and attachments cannot greatly affect him, intense passions do not disturb his mental state and create turmoil; the attraction of objects does not make his mind waver; honor and dishonor, pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, etc., do not cause distractions in his mind; stories, love stories, or any kind of gossip do not attract his mind.

## Collection of Yogic Insights (212)

Because this great aspirant knows this mind-matter trickery well. This monkey-like mind runs here and there, gets distracted, whatever it does. Therefore, he understands that it should not be left free. He understands that it is like this: "Because it thinks in the mind, it thinks that - at night or during the day, in a populated place or in a desolate place, it doesn't matter; this mind goes to the sky in a moment and to the underworld in a moment! The ascetic who aspires for liberation studies knowledge and meditation, there this enemy-like mind thinks something like this, so that it throws him on the wrong path, puts him on the wrong track! Those who are knowledgeable in great scriptures, who are called 'Agamdhars', even in their hands, this mind does not get caught in any way - it cannot be brought under control like a mad elephant! And somewhere if it is forcefully subdued, scorned and treated like a dog, it becomes crooked like a snake, it turns upside down! If we call this mind a thief, it doesn't seem to be stealing, and it's not a moneylender either! It is in everyone and separate from everyone! It creates wonder in the mind! And it resides in the mind! Whatever I say, it doesn't listen to this world, and tomorrow! It remains in its own opinion! No matter who explains it, whether it is a sage, a man, or a learned person, even my school-great, vast explanations, it doesn't understand! I knew that this mind is impotent, but it pushes all the men, puts them on the wrong track! In other matters, it is 'masculine', but it cannot do anything to this mind! The mind is so difficult to please, it is difficult to appease, therefore, I do not believe the saying that 'he who has conquered the mind has conquered everything'. The more I try to keep this mind, the more it runs away, further and further! It doesn't get caught! It doesn't come to a place!

The mind does not get caught anywhere. Where is it? The mind does not get caught anywhere; the more I try to keep it, the more it runs away... Yes, where is it? It goes to the underworld in the night and day, in a populated place and a desolate place.

The snake eats and its mouth is full, this is the proverb's meaning... Yes, where is it? The ascetic who aspires for liberation, studies knowledge and meditation; this mind thinks something like this. It throws him on the wrong path... Yes, where is it? Even in the hands of the Agamdhars, it does not get caught in any way;

Where it is forcefully subdued, it becomes crooked like a snake... Yes, where is it?

If I call it a thief, it doesn't seem to be stealing, and it's not a moneylender either;

It is in everyone and separate from everyone, it creates wonder in the mind... Yes, where is it?

## Bahadashti: Duraradhya Manamarkat, Tavshushrusha

(213) Whatever is done, the ears do not heed, it remains in its own opinion; even if the gods, humans, and learned people explain, it does not understand, oh great scholar. I have known that this linga is neuter, it pushes away all men; another thing is that a man is capable, no one can bind him... Oh Kunthu, the mind that has been controlled has controlled everything, this is not a small matter... Oh Kunthu, those who say this do not believe, this is a great statement... Oh Kunthu"- Shri Anandghanji

Thinking this, he contemplates: "How can I bring this fickle, difficult-to-control mind under control? Because just as water ripples when a stone is thrown into it, so too does this 
(difficult-to-control, wicked mind, like water, ripples when it encounters an obstacle, how can this fickle mind be controlled? "This fickle mind is restless and extremely powerful. How can it be controlled? It is very difficult to control it like the wind." Therefore, now I am defeated, 
how to do it? If dispassion and study are not pursued with intense effort, this mind will never be subdued, it is its nature to wander everywhere, so I should tie this monkey-like mind somewhere! Or I should give it some work to do, so that it can climb and descend at will! Thinking this, he ties this mind with the chain of love to the pillar of the feet of the Supreme Lord, who has conquered this mind! So that this naughty mind cannot wander around! Or he sets it free to play in the Shruta-skandha, so that it can climb and descend in it! Let it eat as much as it wants of the fruit of the soul! Let it pluck the leaves of the vow! Let it swing on the branches of the right faith! Let it dance and jump in the vast root of the intellect!
The mind, difficult to control, has been subdued, the intellect has been brought by the Agam, oh Lord Anandghan, you have brought it, I know it is true. Kunthu"- Shri Anandghanji

4. Tattva-Shushrusha: In this perspective, the third quality, named Shushrusha, is revealed, because the second quality is the quality of inquiry.
* "This mind is restless, I want to control it firmly.
I consider its control as difficult as the wind.
There is no doubt, oh great one, the mind is difficult to control, it is fickle.
But only through dispassion, it can be controlled." - Gita
* "With many fruits of the soul, laden with the burden of the soul, with leaves of vows scattered, with many branches of right faith, on the high peak of the right faith, in the vast root of the intellect, let the wise mind play in the Shruta-skandha." - Shri Gunabhadra Swami's Shri Atmanushasan

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
After manifestation, naturally, the desire to serve, that is, to listen, arises. And this desire to listen is also related to the truth. What is the truth of things? Who am I? What is my form? What is all this other stuff? What is its real form? What is my relationship with it? What is this world? Why is its form so diverse and wonderful? What is dharma? What is the ultimate form of dharma? How is it attained?  The desire to listen to the stories of truth that reveal the answers to these and many other questions related to the truth arises intensely in the seeker with this vision, and an inner desire manifests. Listening through the ear-sense without this intense inner desire is just a name, it is like listening with one ear and letting it out the other! Thus, this being has listened to countless stories and tales, and its ears have even burst from listening! Yet, it has not attained Brahma-jnana, true knowledge of the truth! Because it has not listened with the inner mind, with the inner ear-sense, with the feeling ear-sense, it has only listened superficially.
“The ears burst from listening to stories, yet Brahma-jnana does not come.” - Shri Akhabhakt Brahma
“O, those who are to be heard, those who are to be loved, those who are not to be abandoned.” - Shri Veda-shruti
“Sometimes, a mistake is made in that the relationship between listening and acceptance, the relationship with the truth, is not considered. ‘Shravana’ means to listen, and to listen means to let sounds fall into the ears; and often, this is considered to be enough. x x x To take the word into the ear and accept it with the mind, that is the name ‘shravana’, that is the real and ancient meaning of the word ‘shravana’ according to the scriptures.”
And this desire to listen, without the influence of others or their teachings,
Shri Anandashankar Bapubhai Dhruv, a learned man, expects something from it, because listening is not a matter of chance; therefore, listening is through another, through another’s mouth. That is, primarily, it is to be done through the mouth of a special person, a Brahma-nishtha sadguru, a sadguru; and if that is not possible, then it is to be done through the mouth of a maha-atma, a great soul, who is always present, because the consciousness of such great gurus, who are full of great knowledge, is expressed in the form of ‘akshar’, the eternal form, and it is manifested in their actions, remaining in the form of ‘akshar’. In the absence of a direct self-knowing sadguru, it is beneficial to listen to the words of such indirect self-realized sadgurus, it becomes a great help. In the absence of a sadguru, it is more beneficial to listen to the words of such indirect sadgurus than to listen to the words of ordinary people who are considered to be gurus. This is the opinion of the learned. It is better to do this than to consider anyone as a guru, even if they are devoid of guru-guna.

##  Bala-Dristi: Hearing from the mouth of the Sadguru and the Sat-Shastra (215)

“This Shastra is the elucidator of the existence of the Atma and others; there is no reliance on a direct Sadguru, only on a worthy one. Or, what the Sadguru has said, if it is ignored;
then one should constantly contemplate it and abandon any other opinion.” - Shri Atma-Siddhi

“Is it better to receive direct instruction from an ordinary man, or indirect instruction through the scriptures from an extraordinary man? This question has only one answer. Considering how extraordinary men can perfectly convey their unique Atma in scriptures, it is clear that the second option is superior.” - Prof. Anandshankar Dhruv.

Therefore, this Dristi-wala Mumukhu Yogi Purusha, experiencing an intense desire for Tattva-Shravan, strives to gain access to Shri Sadguru and wishes to hear the Tattva from their mouth. And,
if access to them is not possible, he wishes to hear from the Sat-Shastra. What does he wish to hear? He desires to find resolution to the Tattva-questions churning in his fatherly heart. He wishes to hear the form of peace,
he is eager to hear what the Atma-Tattva is like. What kind of opposition has this being faced before? He wishes to find resolution to the doubt that his Meha-adi Deshas are not yet resolved. He wishes to imagine Bhagwan present, standing before him, and despite all these reasons,
he wishes to ask Bhagwan directly why this being is still not liberated. He becomes one-pointed in his desire to hear the answer. As in, “O Shanti Jin! One request from me, listen, O King of the Three Worlds!
What is the form of peace? How is it known? How is the mind tested?....O Guru of the world, what is the Atma-Tattva? Tell me this thought; without knowing the Atma-Tattva, one cannot attain pure, concentrated mind... Muni-Suvat.” - Shri Anandghanaji

“What opposition did this being face before? What did this red being do? The Meha is not ceasing, the light of the Agam is seen as red.” - Shri Devchandraji

“Because of the reason, the Tattva is with it, it is not a new acquisition... The light of Shri Jinraj shines upon me, who is its cause... Ji.” - Shri Devchandraji

This is the meaning.

Yogadristi Samuccaya:  Nasyaam satyaamasat trushna prakrutyaiva pravarttate. Tadabhavaccha sarvatra sthiteva sukhasanam. || 50 ||  Prakrutithi ja trushna asat, pravartati nahi atra; taas abhave sthit vali, sukhasan ja sarvatra, 50

Meaning: With this vision, false desire does not arise from nature itself. And due to the absence of that false desire, sukhasan (state of blissful ease) is present everywhere.

Commentary: This verse explains how the sukhasan mentioned earlier is attained. When this vision is present, the mind does not wander from one place to another. Therefore, false desire does not arise naturally. And due to the absence of this false desire, sukhasan is present everywhere. Thus, the absence of this false desire in this vision removes the false desire of the seeker. The false desire to attain something like a mirage or a pool of water in a desert does not arise in them. Until now, they have been chasing after this object-oriented mirage-like desire, running and running, but now they are tired and have found rest.

Because this entire living world is mounted on the wheel of samsara (cycle of birth and death). It is constantly revolving due to the infinite substance, field, time, birth, and feeling. It is being driven like a bull by the great delusion that holds the entire world in its grip. While revolving, it experiences intense pain due to desire. Therefore, it jumps like a bull to quench its thirst.

_ *"This entire living world, mounted on the wheel of samsara, is constantly revolving due to the infinite substance, field, time, birth, and feeling.

Therefore, it jumps like a bull to quench its thirst."_

##  Translation:

**Bala-dushti:** The water of a mirage, a delusion, all the pleasures of the world, like a mirage, are a big deception! (217) It leaps into the mirage-like world of objects, but its thirst is not quenched by the water of the mirage, yet it continues to chase after it.

Just as a leper does not feel any hesitation in eating food given by his father's hand, similarly, one who is tired of the world, yet does not get tired of worldly objects and is not indifferent to the fruits of karma. A donkey, even after being kicked by the she-donkey, continues to follow her. Similarly, one who jumps into the flames of fire for the sake of worldly desires, does not turn back, and considers his father's addiction not as a flaw but as an ornament! Just as the deer's chest bursts from running after the mirage, its desire does not decrease, but rather increases! But it does not consider the mirage as real.

- Shri Jnaneśvari Gita: Thus, this being is extremely troubled by this thirst. As it tries to satisfy this thirst, it becomes stronger.

Just as fire flares up when fuel is added to it, similarly, this thirst-fire flares up due to the fuel of worldly desires, causing suffering and growth to the being. Just as the ocean cannot be filled by any amount of water, similarly, this ocean of thirst cannot be filled by any amount of worldly rivers. Even if this being gathers all the great happiness of the gods and others for an infinite time, the thirst will not be quenched, how can it be quenched by the insignificant pleasures of humans, which are like a small pitcher? But it has passed! Now this seeker awakens, and he has developed a strong attachment to detachment. Therefore, he does not run after the false mirage of worldly desires, and he does not suffer in vain. The attachments that were external before, which used to be satisfied by worldly desires, now become internal and are satisfied by the self, experiencing contentment in the self, and experiencing equanimity through the enjoyment of wisdom and good sense. Why would he run after the mirage of worldly objects again to suffer? He will not desire to eat that food again; he will not drink poison to live.

And thus, with the absence of false thirst, this seeker experiences self-contentment. Therefore, this seeker, wherever he may be, in whatever situation, in whatever environment, in whatever company, he always experiences the stability of a comfortable seat. Because the wise man adapts to the situation, is content with the company he has received, and lives happily, comfortably, leisurely, and peacefully, always remaining a king of his own mind. All the running around of his mind stops, and...

Firmness in posture leads to stability of mind. The mind, which was dwelling in the object of its desire, withdraws from it and proceeds to take its seat in the soul. Thus, it remains in this absorption!

Discussion
The Sukhasan mentioned above has been further clarified here. This great person with this vision has such a calmness of mind - such stability remains that all his running around ceases, everywhere he remains in Sukhasan, he sits down calmly with a peaceful mind. The direct result of this is that wherever he goes or whatever action he performs, he does not have even a trace of haste-hurry in that duty, there is no running around. All his actions are united with the dedication of the mind, and this vision does not allow any harm-defect in the sight etc. So whether he goes to the temple or to the shelter, whether he goes for worldly affairs or for the work of the Supreme, whether he goes for the sake of charity or for any other work, even then he does not travel in a hurry,

The collection of Gani says, “Therefore, stand up and pair up, let us say in front of the Jina, the time to serve the feet is pure, let us obtain the joy of wealth – the service of the supreme virtues of Shri Anandghanji, absorption in contemplation, contemplation with certainty; experience the purest taste, reach the feet of Devchandra.” The servant is given a vision, the Lord is well-disposed; whoever contemplates with absorption, for them the feet of Devchandra will be attained…
“Oh Jida! My mind is filled with your name.” – Shri Devchandraji, the Lord’s feet are clung to, they remain fresh, no other limbs are adorned. “The reader praises, I do not contemplate others, I sing the virtues of that Lord.” – Shri Yashovijayji
He who performs Pratikraman, does so with complete devotion and single-minded focus. He becomes aware of his own form through the knowledge of the pleasures, and he regrets any faults that may have occurred in the form of conduct in the other’s influence. He seeks forgiveness with a sincere heart, free from any feelings of attachment, “I renounce, I will not repeat, I will be virtuous.” He purifies the soul, he makes it heavy and light – he frees it from faults and even those faults that have not been committed. This Pratikraman, like the third type of medicine, strengthens the soul’s dharma. Because there are three types of medicine: (1) one removes the disease, if there is none, it creates one, (2) the second removes the disease, if there is none, it does not create any virtue or fault, (3) the third removes the disease, if there is none, it transforms it chemically. Thus, this Pratikraman, being like the third type of medicine, is beneficial.
And in this act of Pratikraman, he is also careful about the six essentials that are included. He takes the vow of Samayik and establishes himself in equanimity. When performing Pratyakhyan, he renounces the other’s influence. While studying, he dwells in the state of the soul. When performing the twenty-four hymns, he remembers the Lord’s innate form, and his mind contemplates the Lord’s virtues. When performing Sadguru Vandana, he contemplates the Lord’s supreme, wonderful, soul-liberating nature, and remembers the Lord’s supreme kindness. When performing Karyotsarg, he experiences a pure state of the soul, as if he were not dwelling in the body. When performing Alochana, he reveals his own faults honestly and openly. When performing Kshamapana, he seeks forgiveness from all beings with a sincere heart, and he develops a feeling of friendship with all the creatures of the world. For example –
“I seek forgiveness from all beings, may all beings forgive me. I will not repeat, I will be virtuous.” – Shri Pratikraman Sutra.

## The Care of the Insightful Run
(221) Thus, he performs every action with utmost care, because he does not allow any harm or loss to the insight, etc., he eliminates all defects and shortcomings, and he diligently cultivates the virtues that are present in this insight. Therefore, he performs these virtuous actions with utmost composure, without any kind of haste, with a focused mind, and with pure vows, and experiences supreme blissful peace.

“He who possesses this pure vow will be the embodiment of peace, he will attain the treasure of bliss, he will receive great honor… Peace is the Jina.” He avoids the great fear, he performs the sevenfold Jina-like service with a mindful heart, he desires to serve the Jina-path. — Shri Anandghanji

It was mentioned above that this seeker does not allow any harm or loss to the insight, etc. This is how: until he reaches this stage, the seeker has performed a lot of yogic practices. In these practices, he does not allow any kind of defect, shortcoming, or loss to the precious gem of momentum that he has attained. He takes special care that no harm comes to him. Just as one would protect a precious gem as if it were their own life, so too does this yogi-father protect the invaluable gem of insight, the gem of omniscience, as if it were his own life. He does not allow any harm or loss to it. Just as one would take care that no blemish comes to a precious gem, and would keep it in a strong cabinet or treasury, so too does this seeker take special care that no blemish comes to the gem of omniscience, and he keeps this gem of omniscience safe and secure in the strong cabinet of his resolute mind. Therefore, he preserves the collection of virtues that he has attained in the insight of the friend, as well as in his own insight.

Not only does he preserve them, but he also takes great care of the gem of virtue that is being attained in this insight.

Because: (1) He waters the seed that he has attained in the insight of the friend, he makes it sprout. That is, he becomes particularly firm in his devotion to the Lord, he is always eager to serve the virtuous, he worships the scriptures more and more, he immerses himself in the waves of detachment, he particularly cherishes the observance of giving, etc., and non-receiving, and he maintains a firm belief and a receptive attitude towards this story of the wise. He strengthens the three-fold power of the non-obstruction of the senses, the non-obstruction of the mind, and the non-obstruction of the body. He refines the air of the emotional world, and he ripens the virtues of the past and the present. Thus, he gradually eliminates the element of false belief and comes closer and closer to right belief. Moreover, he firmly observes the five great vows of non-violence, etc., he does not feel regret in performing virtuous actions, and he does not harbor hatred. (2) And…

The collection of Gadasti (Jain term for a type of spiritual practice) in your vision, observes the five vows (Jain principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-attachment) properly, abandons anxiety, and ignites curiosity. Their devotion towards the Gatha (Jain scriptures) increases, and their respect and service towards pure Yogis (Jain ascetics) become more active. They act appropriately and avoid inappropriate actions. They are curious about those with superior qualities and are troubled by their father's lack of virtues. They are deeply detached from the world and yearn to escape it. Considering the noble ones as their equals, they do not diminish their father's wisdom. Thus, this Chegi (Jain term for a type of spiritual practitioner) preserves the old capital (spiritual progress) and adds new capital to it in this vision. Therefore, as this double vision strengthens their bond, they become more cautious in their religious practices, as it was said.

Asan said. This is what the Shushrusha (Jain term for service) says:

"Just as a young man, along with his beloved, desires to hear divine music, so too, in this vision, is the Shushrusha towards the truth."

Commentary: "Just as a young man, enjoying the company of a beautiful woman, desires to hear divine music, so too, in this vision, is the Shushrusha towards the truth." - Gasaza Ru-2

Here, an example is given to show how intense the desire to listen (Shushrusha) should be - there is a young man, full of youthful vigor, who is handsome. He is healthy, strong, and has all his senses intact. A beautiful, graceful woman, with a great form, is by his side. He lacks nothing in terms of wealth and prosperity. All the materials for enjoying the five senses are always at his service. Thus, he is happy in every way.

Vritti: "With his beloved, with his beautiful beloved, with his charming beloved, just as a young man, a mature man, desires to hear divine music, the music of Kinnaras (celestial beings), so too, in this vision, is the Shushrusha towards the truth."

## Example of Shusha-Shravana-Ichchha (Desire to Hear)

(223) A young man, enjoying himself in a beautiful garden like Nandana Van, immersed in the ocean of happiness, experiences a wave of desire: "I want to hear divine music now. How wonderful it would be to hear the sweet singing of a Kinnara, a celestial being with a voice like a cuckoo! How wonderful it would be to be graced with the melodious music of Gandharvas! How fortunate I would be to hear divine music, resonating with the sounds of instruments like Veena and Veena, and captivating with the dance of celestial beings!" He gets lost in this desire. 

When a Kinnara, Gandharva, or any other celestial being arrives, and begins to play divine music that stirs the strings of his heart, creating a whirlwind of divine music, how eagerly does this young man want to listen? How intently does he absorb the heart-stealing music, as if he were depicted in a painting? How intently does he listen, as if he were a frozen statue?

Similarly, in this state of Shusha-Shravana-Ichchha, a seeker yearns to hear with intense desire, with a longing that never fades. Just as he desires to hear divine music with such enthusiasm, he desires to hear the nectar of divine truth, even more eagerly, through the ears, the organ of hearing. Just as the young man wants to listen with a stillness like a painting, the seeker, thirsty for knowledge, desires to hear the stories of truth with a deep sense of absorption. This natural desire to hear flows from the innate yearning within.

For example:

"Oh, most merciful Sadguru Dev! I do not see the soul. I do not perceive its form. I do not experience anything else. Therefore, the soul does not have a form. Therefore, there is no soul. Therefore, the path to liberation is a delusion. Please explain the true solution to this doubt that has taken root in my heart.

Oh Lord! What is the nature of the soul? How have you known and experienced it? I want to hear about the nature of the soul, because without knowing the pure soul, my mind cannot attain liberation. Different teachers describe its nature in different ways, and my mind is confused by what I hear. You are the only one who can resolve this. Please have mercy!

Oh Supreme Lord! How can I know the supreme Dharma? What is the nature of the self? What is the nature of the other? I want to hear this from your holy mouth. Oh, glorious Mahant! Please explain this to me.

Oh, Purushottama! What is Brahman? What is Karma? What is Adhyatma? What is Adhibhuta? 

Page #290:

(224)
What is the Gadsimucchaya? What is the Adhidaiva? How is the Adhiyajna present in this body? How can you recognize the Niyatatma Yogis during their departure?
“It is not visible, its form is not known; there is no other experience, therefore it is not for the soul's form, not for the Atma, the Mithya Meksha remedy; that inner doubt, the Sadupay explains.” - Shri Atmasiddhi Munisuvrat Jinraj! My one request to the experts! What is the Atmatatva, the world guru has known! Tell me this thought; without knowing the Atmatatva, pure, the mind will not attain Samadhi... Munisuvrat “To the Dharma Param Arnath, what do I know, Bhagvant Re;
Swar explains the glory of the Mahant - Dharma” - Shri Anandghanji etc. in this way, this truly Tatvapipasu - Tatvarasik man expresses his Shravana Chha. And in the hearing of this supreme nectar-like Tatvavarta, this Mumukhu Yogi gets so much joy, that even in the infinite part, he does not get this much joy even by listening to divine music together!
And this (Shushrusha) is of this type, therefore it is said -

**Shushrusha: The Stream of Knowledge**

(25) **Meaning:** This Shushrusha, the desire to listen, is like a stream of knowledge. Without it, listening is futile, like digging a well in barren land without a stream.

**Commentary:**

"The stream of knowledge is like a well, without it, the land is barren. Listening is like a king, who sleeps and hears nothing." - Ch. 20, Sanmay, Ru. 3

Here, the desire to listen, Shushrusha, is like a stream of knowledge. Just as a well with a stream will always have water, so too will a strong desire to listen bring forth a continuous flow of knowledge. But just as a well without a stream will not have water, so too will a lack of Shushrusha, a lack of this desire, prevent the flow of knowledge, leaving the well of knowledge empty.

Without Shushrusha, all listening becomes dust, like hearing nothing at all. It enters one ear and exits the other, never reaching the heart. It is like digging a well in barren land, where no matter how deep you dig, no water will be found. The effort is wasted, and only fatigue remains.

In such listening, the sound waves strike the eardrum and are lost back into the air. This is illustrated in the following diagram:

**Diagram 8**

**Diagram 9**

**Knowledge-filled well = Knowledge-filled mind**

**Barren land = Lack of Shushrusha**

**Stream of knowledge = Shushrusha**

The absence of Shushrusha is like the absence of a stream of knowledge.

**Yoga-drushti-samuchaya**

Just as a king, while lying down at night, hears stories, and in his sleep and wakefulness, he may also utter exclamations, but his attention is not on them, and he does not remember what he heard! And in the morning, he wakes up and asks, "Hey! What story was told last night?"

Similarly, one who listens without proper attention, is like one who is asleep! For this reason, he may also exclaim, "Oh! Maharaj!" but he does not realize what he has heard! He comes home and asks, "What did Maharaj speak about today?" Thus, listening without proper attention is useless and futile, it does not touch the heart, it is like pouring water from one ear to the other! True listening happens when the mind is pleased, the body is excited, and the hair on the body stands on end. Listening to a story of virtues without such a desire is like singing in front of a deaf person! It is like reciting the Bhagavad Gita to a buffalo! As the English proverb says, it is like "Casting pearls before swine."

“When the mind is pleased, the body is excited, let me be pleased by one tune;
Without such a desire, the story of virtues is like singing in front of a deaf person...
Jinji! Hail to your teachings.”—Chag॰ Sajjay Ru-4

Here, Vyatireka says—

श्रुताभावेऽपि भावेऽस्याः शुभभावप्रवृत्तितः ।
फलं कर्मक्षयाख्यं स्यात्परबोधनिबन्धनम् ॥ ५४ ॥

Even in the absence of listening, if there is a desire to listen, due to the activity of good feelings, the fruit called karma-kshaya is obtained, which is the cause of supreme knowledge. 54

**Meaning:** Even in the absence of listening, if there is a desire to listen, due to the activity of good feelings, the fruit called karma-kshaya is obtained, which is the cause of supreme knowledge.

**Analysis:**

The above praises the desire to listen, which is further strengthened by Vyatireka, i.e., negative statement. Even if there is a strong desire to listen to such truths, but there is no actual listening, 
**Vritti:**- Even in the absence of listening, **Mavedacha:**- if there is a feeling of desire, (if this desire is present), what? That is- **Zumamayapravrittittah:**- due to the activity of good feelings, - that desire to listen is itself conducive to good, **Haru Mayarls Chan Karmakshaya** named fruit is obtained, due to the validity of the statement (due to the validity of the scriptures). And this **Vanopaniyandhanam:**- is the cause of supreme knowledge, the main cause of liberation, due to the validity of the statement.

## Aladasht: Even service without listening is successful and free from fault (27)

If there is no connection, what then? It is explained here that even though there is service, but no listening, even then, that service is an activity in auspiciousness, therefore it produces a karma-destroying effect, and that karma-destroying effect is the cause of the highest type of knowledge. Thus, just having the true inner desire to serve and listen is a great thing, it is praiseworthy, and traditionally it is also beneficial. Because due to such auspiciousness, the proportion of karma is destroyed, and as a result, the cause of the highest knowledge is obtained. Those who are true seekers of liberation, due to their good fortune, are drawn to and obtain the cause of the highest knowledge; they find the connection with the virtuous person and the virtuous teacher, and they obtain the virtuous scriptures, etc. Just as a magnet attracts iron, so it attracts them (Like attracts like). There is also such an irresistible attraction in this service, that the meeting with the true speaker, the virtuous person, happens from anywhere. If there is a desire to quench thirst, then the way to quench it is also found.

Service destroys karma

Thus, listening without service is unsuccessful, but service without listening is not unsuccessful, but is successful with the fruit of karma-destruction. Just as when one is truly hungry and eats, it is pleasing, palatable, satisfying, and digestible; just as when one is very thirsty and drinks water, it is sweet and like nectar, and quenches the thirst; similarly, when one has a true hunger to listen to the truth, a true thirst to drink the nectar of truth, then that listening is pleasing, palatable, and results in nectar for the soul; otherwise, it is like a leaky pot, the water leaks out through another hole! It does not stay in the heart! Therefore, the greatness of this quality of service is immense.

"If you are thirsty, there is a way to find water." - Shrimad Rajchandraji 5

In the connection, the quality of non-fault is mentioned -

"There is never any fault in the beginning of an auspicious connection. The skill of the means and its subject matter should be beautiful." 55

Commentary: - Gumayonalmaame - In the beginning of an auspicious connection, and in such types of meditation, etc., there is never any fault in listening, etc., in this authorized view. Uvachjaouraast Vi - Similarly, the skill of the means, the skillfulness, etc., - such types of country, etc., seat, etc., related, Cha - Shaolan, beautiful, Tadvishachan - its subject matter, the subject matter of the auspicious connection, Maveth is there. 

Page #294:

(228)
Yoga-stisamuccaya
A: - In this perspective, there is never any interruption in the performance of auspicious yagas; and the means - skill in this regard - is also beautiful.
Discussion
Here, the quality of non-interruption is explained. In the previous perspective, the defect of agitation was abandoned, so after that, the defect of interruption also goes away in due course. Therefore, in this perspective, when a yogi performs meditation and other auspicious yagas, there is never any interruption, no obstacle or hindrance, the mind does not become agitated or disturbed. Therefore, when he meditates, he does it with a concentrated mind and pure intention, he does not become agitated by external stimuli; when he performs devotion to the Lord, he does it with pure dedication and complete absorption, he does not become agitated by distractions; when he performs Samayika and Swadhyay, he does it with equanimity and utmost calmness, he does not become distracted by the thoughts of heaven and hell; when he performs Pratikramana and other virtuous actions, he does it with a true feeling of repentance for his own defects, but he does not let his mind wander elsewhere; when he performs any other moksha-achieving yoga, or any other pure tapasya or other Dharma-related actions, he does it with self-awareness and complete absorption, but he does not become distracted by the desire for worldly pleasures.
Similarly, in the means related to meditation and other auspicious yagas, this seeker of liberation possesses skill and expertise, he exhibits the skill of an artist. He has a thorough knowledge of how to perform these yagas in the best way. And thus, being skilled in the means, he can perform these yagas beautifully. Because one who is skilled in the art of weaponry is adept at playing with weapons; similarly, one who truly knows the method of meditation and other practices is skilled in the practice of meditation and other practices. Just as one who is well-trained in exercise is skilled in wrestling and other activities; similarly, one who truly knows the means of meditation and other practices is skilled in achieving meditation and other practices. For example, if one wants to meditate, one should know the appropriate place and other things, one should know the method of asanas. If one knows this, then one can truly practice the means. A skilled craftsman can truly perform his work, but an unskilled one cannot; similarly, a skilled seeker can perform meditation and other practices skillfully, but an unskilled one cannot. The Gita says, "Cho: Manu Kausham."
"Now, from the words of the Jina, knowing the path of the seeker...O Lord;
With the taste of the goal, we perform the method of the means...O Lord." Shri Devchandraji

##  **Baladeṣṭi: Unhindered by the Means, the Means are the Bondage!**
(229)

And in this view, the Amūcchaya says:

**"परिष्कारगतः प्रायो विघातोऽपि न विद्यते । अविघातश्च सावद्यपरिहारान्महोदयः ॥५६॥**

**"Priṣkāragataḥ prāyo vighāto'pi na vidyate | Avighātaś ca sāvadya-parihārānmahodayaḥ ||56||"**

**Meaning:** In the matter of the means, there is generally no hindrance, and due to the avoidance of the faults, there is a great non-hindrance.

**Explanation:** Here, the collection of qualities that are present in the other view is stated in a general way (generalization): (1) Here, there is generally no hindrance related to the means - no obstruction to desire, (2) and due to the avoidance of sinful actions, there is a great non-hindrance - a non-obstruction that leads to liberation and supreme bliss.

In this view, the aspiring yogi who is engaged in this path does not generally experience any hindrance related to the means. The means are those things that help in achieving Dharma-siddhi (spiritual liberation).

By not being attached to the means, by not clinging to them, these great souls do not become hindered by the means, they do not get stuck. Because they know that the means are not the goal, they are just tools. Therefore, they do not consider the means as everything, they do not get caught up in the means, but they constantly focus on the goal of self-realization, which is to be achieved through the means. They always have the goal in mind and use the means accordingly. Therefore, the false attachment to the means, the struggle for the means, the disputes about the means, all disappear automatically. They do not become lost in the means, because they have learned from the teachings of the Jinas that the means should be used with pure devotion to the goal.

**"Pancha mahāvrat dhānya taṇu, karṣaṇa vadhyā re; sādhȳabhāva nija thāpī, sāghanatāe sadhyā re...śrī nami."**

**"Sādhȳarasī sādhakapane, abhisandhi rakhe nija lakṣa chhe." - Śrī Devacandraji Vṛtti-Ridārājāt**

**Meaning:** In relation to the purification and the means, the meaning is that, generally, there is no hindrance, no obstruction to desire. Here, in this view, there is both hindrance and non-hindrance. What kind of hindrance and non-hindrance? It is said that due to the avoidance of faults, due to the avoidance of the prohibited, due to the abandonment, there is a great non-hindrance, a non-hindrance that leads to liberation and supreme bliss. 

Page #296:
---------------------------
(230)
Yoga-drushti-samuccaya
Just as foolish, clinging souls, who, like the tools of religion, which are only instruments for self-realization, miss their goal, and get lost in the false attachment to those tools, in trivial differences of opinion, in petty quarrels, in small enclosures, and consider that to be their duty; such great souls with vast vision do not believe in those. Because they understand well that - the wise men have said that whatever external tools, whatever material-emotional instruments they have shown, they have said it only for the benefit of the soul, not for its harm, but even in that, if the soul holds a sense of possessiveness, creates an obstacle in the form of desire, becomes unconscious, then those tools become the opposite of tools! They become obstacles! The instrument becomes a burden! For example,
Unconsciousness as an obstacle
Temples, upashrayas, etc., have been built for many souls for the ease and convenience of devotion, study, etc., but even in them, if there is competition, rivalry, a sense of "mine" and "yours", if a possessive, clinging mentality is held even towards the impartial, selfless, non-attached Lord, if petty quarrels like who climbed higher are made, and hatred is increased, then the desired purpose is destroyed; the instrument becomes a burden! And the upashraya is also, for a certain time, for the temporary use of a wandering muni, like a bird, with the permission of the householder. But even in that, if a possessive attachment to the territory is made, like this one is given this place and that one is given that place, then even that upashraya becomes an obstacle! The gachchha-gana, too, is originally made for organization and coordination, but even that, if it becomes a place of possessiveness, a dwelling place for pride, a battlefield for anger and quarrels, or a display of narrow-mindedness like an enclosure, then even that becomes a burden! It becomes an obstacle to the soul!
The instrument becomes a burden!
“Many see the divisions of the gachchha, but they are not ashamed to speak of the truth! They are tired of doing their own work, like filling the north; the king of the Kali Yuga is a cruel one....” - Shri Anandghanaji
The scriptures are only meant for reading and understanding by the soul, and for their beneficial use. Instead, if someone claims ownership of them, and hoards them like a miser, and establishes their possessiveness in them, then it becomes an obstacle. Or, if someone uses the scriptures for their own benefit, with pride like "how learned I am", "how well I can lecture", "what a speaker I am", then it becomes an obstacle for the soul. Or, if the scriptures are used for criticism, for debate, or for pointless arguments, then that too...

## Baladashti: Serving the Means with the Soul

(231) The meaning of bondage is this: Just as worldly possessions like wife, children, etc., are the world for the foolish, so too, for the ignorant and spiritually unrefined, "scriptural world" is their bondage!

Similarly, even the most excellent means like Yama, Niyama, Samyama, Tyaga, Vairagya, etc., become bondage if they are performed with attachment, or if they are performed forgetting the desired goal, or if the means are considered the goal itself. Shri Ratnakarpachisi says:

"Vaishachar Pavashyanaach, Dharmopadeisho Sansanay. Vaaday Vidyaadhyayanam Cha Me'bhoot, Kiyad Bruve Hasya Karam Swamiish."

Knowing this, the seeker of liberation (Mumukshu) uses these instruments as instruments. He serves these means as means and does not create attachment or desire-restriction, thus not making them bondage. Because he serves Yama, Niyama, Samyama, Tyaga, Vairagya, Bhakti, Japa, Tapa, Vrata, Shastra, etc., all these extremely beneficial means, only as means, with the soul. He constantly keeps the goal of pure self-realization in mind. Just as the arrow of the archer aiming at Radha is focused on the target (the idol of Radha), similarly, the seeker of liberation constantly focuses on the ultimate goal of pure soul (Atma). Because of this, he does not experience any obstacles in the means, and desire-restriction does not hinder him.

Similarly, this seeker of liberation avoids all means, abandons all sinful actions, and does not engage in prohibited conduct. Therefore, he diligently practices the eighteen stages of non-violence (Ahimsa). This also ensures that he does not face any obstacles in his spiritual practice, and he remains free from desire-restriction. Nothing hinders him. He practices his spiritual path with purity and without any distractions.

And this obstacle-free spiritual practice bears the fruit of great joy. Therefore, this pure and obstacle-free spiritual practice brings about the attainment of Amudaya-Punyadaya (liberation from the cycle of birth and death) and the achievement of liberation (Moksha) for the seeker. This great joy is his reward!

"Obstacles are not present here, in the pursuit of Dharma; by avoiding misconduct, one attains great joy. Oh Jinendra! Wealth." - Shri Ye Das Rupa

The Essence of Alaashti
Here, the vision is firm like a blazing fire, and the third limb of the yag, the asana, is attained. Due to the absence of false desires, there is a state of blissful ease everywhere. There is a continuous flow of uninterrupted movement, and due to the absence of obstacles, all actions are performed with dedication.
The third virtue, called Shushrusha, is attained here. This young, happy man has a desire to hear divine music, as intense as the desire for water in a parched land. This Shushrusha is like a stream of wisdom, flowing like a river. Without it, listening is like digging a well in a barren land - futile. Even if listening doesn't happen, the influence of this Shushrusha brings about a good result through the body, which becomes the cause of excellent wisdom.
The Collection of Yag
Here, the third mental flaw, called Kshepa, is abandoned. Therefore, there is no accusation related to the fourfold path, and there is skill and expertise in the remedy for the fourfold path. Also, there are no obstacles in the matter of equipment, and due to the abandonment of sin, there is a great, unobstructed state. The table of clear vision -

Bhujangi:
In clear vision, like a blazing fire, in the clear land, the appropriate conduct is believed; the essence of true Shushrusha is embraced, the yagi never experiences accusation in the fourfold path. 46. Abandoning the study of the body, which is without beginning, one joins the study of the self; the yagi remains in a state of blissful ease, immersed in the twenty-four principles. 47.

## Balaadristi: Kalash Kavya

**(233)** By nature, in this vision, there is no craving, no falsehood, no where.  It resides in the state of happiness, everywhere, therefore, it plays in the comfort of the soul with happiness. 48.  Wherever you go or whatever you do, be quick, without any obstacles, with a steady mind;  holding the vow, always being self-contented, do not let any flaw enter this vision. 49.  Happy, beautiful, youthful, like the sound of Gandharva singing; here, the thirst for the truth is like that, like a thirsty person desires water. 50.  Who am I? From where did I come? In what true form, oh! have I remained? What are all these relationships that bind me?  The great thirst for the truth. 51.  Here, compare it to the vein of water, this praise of the true thirst for the truth; without the thirst for the truth, all that is heard is in vain, like digging a well in barren land.  52.  Even though the knowledge is heard, the true thirst for the truth, if it is weak in the mind due to the feeling of attachment, it will diminish, but the purpose of the knowledge will be achieved. 53.  The beginning of the attachment, the steady mind, sometimes the attachment, sometimes the detachment; the best remedy for the poison, the skill is shown here.  Sometimes, do not hold on to the means, do not make the means your bondage; always run away from sin, like a river flows towards the ocean.

**Traatak:**  The firm vision, the steady posture, resides; the thirst for the ultimate truth, it yearns;  without interruption, the auspicious light shines, the joy of the mind, the progress, it rejoices.

**This is the third Balaadristi, from the Sri Yogadristi Samuccaya Shakha, explained in detail with the commentary called "Sumanaanandani Brihattika", written by Bhagavanadas, the son of Kiratchandra, the disciple of the great sage Haribhadracharya.** 

Page #300:
---------------------------
## Deepra-drishti

Bala has spoken. Now Deepa speaks.

**"Praanayamavati Deepa na Yogotthaanavatyalam. Tattvasravansamyukta Sukshmabodhavivarjita."** (57)

**"Praanayama in Deepra-drishti, not the upliftment of Yoga; it is accompanied by the hearing of the truth, but devoid of subtle knowledge."** (57)

**Commentary:**

"From the perspective of Yoga, there is no upliftment in Deepra-drishti. Praanayama is only in the sense of the light of knowledge...

Oh Jinendra! Your words are sweet." - (G 60, Sakjaya K-1)

This is the fourth chagad-drishti named Deepa. Therefore, the fourth limb of Yoga - Praanayama - is present here, according to the previous sequence. The fourth intention of upliftment is abandoned, and the fourth quality of hearing is manifested. However, the vision is still devoid of subtle knowledge and is compared to the light of a lamp. It is like this:

**"Vritti-Praanayamavati-Praanayamavati, Praanayamawali Chaturthi Anga na Bhaavathi, Bhaav Rechak Aadi Bhaavathiki, Teeka-Deeka, Chethi Drishti, Shaalaathaanavati-Chaag na Utthaanavali Nathi Hoti, Tatha Prakaarna na Prashaantavaahita na Laabhathi, Sha-Atyant, Saraakravaran Tarvasravana thi Samyukta - Shashrashana Kul Sravana thi Samyukta, Shushana Falbhaavathi. Suavivarjita - Sukshma Bedha thi Vivarjita, Sukshma - Nipuna Bedha thi Rahith Aavi."**

**"Praanayamavati - possessing Praanayama, the fourth limb, in the sense of - the sense of Rechak, etc., Teeka-Deeka - the fourth vision, Shaalaathaanavati - not possessing the upliftment of the Chaag, Tatha - thus, by the benefit of the tranquil flow of the mind, Sha - extremely, Saraakravaran Tarvasravana thi Samyukta - united with the hearing of the essence, Shashrashana Kul Sravana thi Samyukta - united with the hearing of the whole, Shushana Falbhaavathi - by the fruit of the essence. Suavivarjita - devoid of subtle knowledge, Sukshma - Nipuna Bedha thi Rahith Aavi - devoid of skillful knowledge."** 

Page #301:
---------------------------
## Deep-Vision: Knowledge Like a Lamp

**Deeper Vision:** This vision is characterized by a gross, rather than subtle, understanding. Although it is more stable and powerful than the previous three visions, it is still considered gross compared to the stable, luminous vision. This is because the knowledge of a lamp, while stronger and more stable than the fire of grass, wood, or fuel, is still weaker and less luminous than the light of gems, stars, etc. Similarly, this Deep-Vision is stronger and more stable than the knowledge of friends, etc., but weaker and less stable than the stable vision.

Just as objects within the circle of light emanating from a lamp are illuminated, but distant, subtle objects outside the circle remain unseen, so too, in this vision, gross objects are perceived, but subtle, distant, and hidden objects remain unseen. Like the oil that fuels a lamp, this vision is limited by its own capacity. It shines as long as the fuel lasts, but once the fuel is exhausted, it extinguishes. Just as a lamp can be extinguished by a gust of wind or become unstable, this vision can also be extinguished or become unstable due to external influences. In many ways, the limitations of this vision are comparable to those of a lamp.

Here, as per the previously mentioned characteristics of "vision," there is a constant adherence to right faith, which gradually eliminates wrong actions and brings one closer to right actions.

**Pranayama:** Here, the focus is on the spiritual aspect of Pranayama. The external, physical aspect of Pranayama, which involves controlling the breath, is not the primary focus here. This is because such physical practices, being merely a form of bodily purification, can only lead to mental restlessness and hinder the practice of true Pranayama.

There are three types of external Pranayama: (1) Exhaling the breath, known as **Rechaka** Pranayama. (2) Inhaling the breath, known as **Pooraka** Pranayama. (3) Holding the breath still, like water in a vessel, known as **Kumbhaka** Pranayama.

**Note:** The text refers to a source for further information on Pranayama. 

Page #302:
---------------------------
(23)
The opinion of Patanjali and others in the Yoga Darshan is that, "Through Pranayama, the veil of light is destroyed, and the mind becomes fit for Dharana." That is, the veil of Klesha, which is the light of the mind, is destroyed, and the mind, which is stabilized by Pranayama, is easily held in the desired state. And what Patanjali and others have said is appropriate, as it is seen in some special men, because Yogis have a lack of interest in small things. Therefore, even in the Bhagavat Jinapravan, breathing and exhaling are prohibited because they lead to distraction. Because, just as it is beneficial to do activities that lead to Samadhi, so too is it not beneficial to exert too much effort in the form of Pranayama.
Otherwise, if we look at it from the perspective of Bhava, then through the elimination of external Bhava, the fulfillment of internal Bhava, and the stabilization of the definite meaning, Bhava Pranayama is achieved. It is of this type: (1) Just as in the external gross action of Pranayama, there is Bhava Pranayama in the action of exhaling, so too in Bhava Pranayama, there is the action of exhaling, which is to eliminate external Bhava and the influence of others. That is, the external Bhava in the form of attachment to women, family, etc. is eliminated. (2) Just as in external Pranayama, the action of inhaling is performed, so too in Bhava Pranayama, the action of filling the internal Bhava within is performed. That is, the internal Bhava in the form of Vivek, which arises from Shravana, is filled. (3) Just as in Hatha Yoga Pranayama, after inhaling, the action of Kumbhaka is performed, which is to hold the breath steady like water in a pot, so too here in Bhava Pranayama, the action of Kumbhaka is performed, which is the stability and location of the internal Bhava. That is, the stabilization of the definite meaning is achieved. Thus, Bhava Pranayama is the nature of Atma Bhava, and it is the limb of Yoga without any deviation. That is, external Pranayama may or may not be a limb of Yoga, but this Bhava Pranayama is definitely a limb of Yoga. Therefore, this spiritual Pranayama is the most excellent and best Pranayama.

## Deepramadristi: Chag's Anutthan, Tantrvaan

66
:
Abandon the inner Ahitram, become the Atma, be steadfast;
The Paramatma is the Atma, feel the Atma, dedicate yourself to the Atma." - Shri Anandghanji Shuddha Dev, while singing the Avlakhan Bhajan, he forgets the Parbhaav. "Inner Atar, attain Atmataa, be present, the Parparinat is Nirrid," - Shri Devchandraji.

**Anusthan**

Chag's Utthan - rising up, does not happen here, because there is a state of Shantavaahita, that is, there is a flow of peaceful Rasa, such that the Chitt does not rise from the Chag. Just as a calm river flows continuously and peacefully, without any waves, similarly, here, the flow of the peaceful Rasa of the Chagritha flows continuously, without any waves of Utthan. Because the Kshep, a type of Dosha, was eliminated in the previous Dristi, therefore, there is no disturbance in the Chitt in any way. Therefore, peaceful Rasa flows in the Chitt, and the Chag does not rise from its place. The Chitt remains absorbed in the initiated Chagkriya. Thus, Anusthan decreases. But if this Shantavaahita - calmness, is not present, then Utthan occurs in the Chag, that is, the mind rises from the Prabdh Chagkriya, it becomes uplifted, it is produced, the Chitt does not remain absorbed - it does not become steady. However, even in such a state of Unman, the Chagkriya, which is worthy of being abandoned, is not abandoned. For example, someone has taken Diksha, and they are completely incapable of following it, their mind has risen from it, in such a case, it is better to abandon that Diksha and take the Shravak's Lig. However, due to fear of Lenida, etc., they do not abandon the Muni Lig. This is an example of the Utthan Dosha. Such Utthan Dosha is eliminated here.

**(237)**

Shantavaahita Vishnu is now present, the Chag that has Utthan;
Abandon the Chag, because of that, the Dhyan that is not abandoned... Prabhu - Sa 20 Ga Stdha - 10

In the previous Dristi, the Guna of Shrausha - the desire to listen, has manifested, therefore, naturally, in sequence, the Shravan of the Tattva is present here. As mentioned earlier, Shushrusha, without the desire to listen - without the inner Jijnaasa, is in vain. It is important to keep this in mind. Shushrusha without Shravan may be beneficial, but Shravan without Shushrusha is not beneficial. Therefore, Shravan with the pursuit of Shushrusha - with Anusthan, is beneficial. And this Shravan is not just the sound hitting the Karnendriya and listening; but the acceptance of the sound through the Antahkarnendriya, from the Antaratma, the acceptance of the Bhaav, that is called Shravan. Thus, this Jiva, with deceit...

He has heard so many words about the collection of Gadasthi that his eardrums have even become numb! Even then, he has not attained Brahmajnana! Because he has not truly heard the essence, he has not heard with the inner consciousness that understands the meaning and the feeling. Shri Akhabhakt has said a profound word: "The ears have become numb from listening to the stories, yet Brahmajnana has not come."

Bhavarechak Adi Guna says:
"Dharma is greater than life, there is no doubt about it. One abandons life for Dharma, but not Dharma in the face of danger to life." (58)
Meaning: This is the perspective, Dharma is considered greater than life, without a doubt. One sacrifices life for Dharma, but in the face of danger to life, one does not abandon Dharma.

Commentary: This perspective, Dharma is greater than life, even in the face of danger to life, see! This is the essence of this perspective...mind... (2.20, 2.4.3)

A Yogi who lives with this perspective, undoubtedly feels that Dharma is much greater than life. The greatness of Dharma shines brighter than life. In the whole world, life is considered the most precious thing. The whole world is working for the preservation of life, and everyone is ready to do anything to protect it. But this Yogi feels that Dharma is more precious than even this most precious life. That is why he does not hesitate to give up his life for Dharma, and even when faced with danger to life, he does not abandon Dharma to save his life. If he has to protect life or Dharma, his first choice is to protect Dharma. He follows Dharma even at the cost of his life. For example:

"The tradition of the Raghukul has always been,
Life may go, but the word will not go." - Shri Tulsidasji's Ramayana.

Meaning: Dharma is greater than life, even greater than the senses and other animals. Guru-Dharma is the greatest, the most important. This is the authoritative perspective, without a doubt. Why? Because it says: "One abandons life for Dharma, but not Dharma in the face of danger to life."

**Dimadrusti:** "Truly, the battle is for Dharma - Dharma and life are to be given up. (239) This is the firm Dharma, this firm Dharma is like the color of madder - it is ingrained. And this color of Dharma is the true color, all other colors are like kites - they are a flash for four days. "Truly, the battle is for Dharma." The body may decay, rot, fall, and be destroyed, but the color of Dharma never decays, rots, falls, or is destroyed.

The greatness of this pure religion, which is supremely beneficial, removes suffering and brings happiness, resides in the heart of the seeker. Therefore, it is no surprise that this seeker would even sacrifice his life, even be willing to die for this religion, and not turn back from the heat. Because he considers this religion to be his very life, he considers himself lost if this religion is lost, and he considers his life protected if this religion is protected. He believes this with a pure heart. Therefore, by accumulating and protecting this religion, which is like his life, he grows in his devotion to it; and he sacrifices his life for it. In other words, he dedicates his life to the noble activity of awakening the true self, of achieving the realization of the self, which is the manifestation of the true self; and if he faces a threat to his life, he continues to engage in this activity of awakening the true self, continues to strive for self-realization, and never abandons this religion. He is a steadfast follower of the religion.

Here, the author says:

"Only one friend follows even after death; everything else perishes with the body." (59)

Meaning: Religion is the only true friend that follows even after death. Everything else perishes with the body.

Commentary:

Religion is the only true friend because friendship is based on companionship. A friend is one who does not abandon you in happiness or sorrow, in prosperity or adversity, in good times or bad times, who remains in your heart and does not abandon his love for you. If anyone deserves the name "friend," it is religion. Because after death, only religion follows the one who practices it, it goes after him, it remains with him forever.

Interpretation:

The author emphasizes that religion is the only true friend, unlike other relationships that end with death. This is because religion provides a constant source of guidance, support, and purpose, even in the face of death. The author uses the term "friend" to highlight the intimate and enduring nature of the relationship between a person and their religion.

**Dimadrushti:** "Love for Dharma is the true love, which remains wherever it is. (241) All other so-called relatives are related to the body, and they perish with the body. When the body perishes, the relationship also ends. Relatives burn the dead body and return from the cremation ground, perform purification rituals, mourn for a while, and then forget the name of the deceased! Not only that, but sometimes they fight over the deceased's property, file lawsuits, and make a big fuss over the deceased's name! They make a mockery of it! The learned Shri Mansukh Bhai has vividly depicted this in his poignant words:

"O conscious one! What do they do after you leave? You spent your entire life for them, but they don't care whether you attain a good or bad destiny. They don't even think about it. But after you leave, they scramble for your wealth; they grab it; they create chaos in the distribution; some get less, some get more - this leads to conflict. Some praise you, while others mock you. Thus, they behave selfishly towards you after your death. Wives mourn for a long time, knowing that their husband's happiness is gone, and they cling to his name. Men also remember your name, calling you brother or son, and they remember you with long sighs; but none of them think about your destiny. What destiny did you attain? What happened to you? Are you happy or unhappy? O conscious one! They don't think about any of this." (etc.) - Shri Mansukh Bhai Kiratchandra's Shant Sudharas, Death Reformer, p. 46.

"You are dead, the world has drowned." - Saint Birji

Thus, everyone in the world engages in love and affection based on their own self-interest, but all that love and affection is not true, it is illusory. There is no value in this conditional love. True love and affection are unconditional, free from self-interest and other attachments, and are purely selfless and loving. "Everyone in the world engages in love and affection, but it is not true love and affection; unconditional love and affection is true, conditional love is like a lost treasure." - Shri Anandghanji

"The one who has attained glory, whose brilliance has been extinguished by the fire of sorrow, whose strength has been weakened by grief and hardship, whose body has been weakened by sorrow, whose wealth has been taken away by relatives, whose family has been destroyed, has been brought under their control." - Shri Vinay Vijayji's Shant Sudharas.

(242)
The collection of yogic insights and such selfless, impartial, purely altruistic love-engagement, that is the Dharma itself. "Love for Dharma is true love." Because Dharma is the ultimate friend-well-wisher. Just as wherever this being goes, it always remains imbued with love for Dharma, it performs true friendship; it remains benevolent everywhere, and by its very nature, it truly achieves welfare, and continues to perform the role of a true, well-wishing friend. Therefore, this ultimate altruistic love for the ultimate welfare-friend in the form of Dharma, never leaves its embrace, as is evident from the above. Because all scriptures clearly state that - "There is suffering from sin and happiness from Dharma, therefore do not commit sin, and accumulate Dharma."
Because no matter how much a human being deceives, no matter how much black deeds he performs, no matter how much wealth he accumulates, no matter how much "wealth" he gathers, no matter how many estates and salaries he builds, no matter how much prosperity and wealth he acquires, even if he conquers the entire world, trampling underfoot all his enemies, and even if he attains the position of a universal emperor, when the time of death arrives, all that will remain as it is, whatever is his will remain where it is, and under the command of Yama, this body-dwelling will be emptied in an instant, without even a moment's notice, leaving behind all possessions, and he will have to return empty-handed, just as he came. It is said about the mighty conqueror Alexander (Sikandar) that when he was on his deathbed, he ordered that when his body was being carried, his hand should be kept open, and the world should be shown that Sikandar came empty-handed and leaves empty-handed. "Attachment to possessions, it brings birth after birth, whatever is yours, it remains there, no one comes along with you...Jinaji! Miccha Dukkad Aaj."

With a pure heart and a desire to hear the truth, the true Dharma, the Dharma of the self, comes along with the Dharma friend. (24)  Therefore, understanding that "the hand is with the hand," the wise man, with his soul, worships Dharma as much as he can.
इत्थं सदाशयोपेतस्तत्त्वश्रवणतत्परः। प्राणेभ्यः परमं धर्म बलादेव प्रपद्यते ॥६०॥ Thus, with a pure heart, he is eager to hear the truth. He accepts Dharma, which is greater than life itself, by force. 60 Meaning - Thus, with a pure heart, he is eager to hear the truth, and accepts Dharma, which is greater than life itself, by force.
Discussion
As mentioned above, this insightful yogi considers Dharma to be his ultimate friend and well-wisher. He develops a deep friendship with Dharma, a strong Dharma bond. As the saying goes, "Whoever you associate with, you become like them," he becomes a true Dharma soul, a Dharma embodiment, through the influence of Dharma's company. The influence of Dharma permeates him, reaching his very bones and marrow. Because - "Excellent qualities, through love...we get the best place...qualities.
Excellent is his own glory...the best place in the world...qualities." Shri Yashovijayji "Excellence increases with excellent company, infinite joy with it." - Shri Devchandraji.
And thus, his mind and intention become pure and radiant, leading to good and auspicious results. His mental state becomes as clear and bright as crystal,
so that he becomes a suitable vessel (Receptacle) with a pure heart to receive the pure water of truth. Good company removes vices and brings about the truth of Dharma, just as the company of this Dharma friend removes evil conduct and brings about the attainment of good conduct. The mind becomes pure, clear, and detached, and when the mind becomes pure, it results in the manifestation of virtues like devotion. - Explanation - Thus, with a pure heart, he is eager to hear the truth, and accepts Dharma, which is greater than life itself, by force, due to his nature. This is not a forced elevation, but a natural inclination.

“The collection of Gadasti, meeting the cool Jin, makes the devotee’s mind pure.” – Shri Yashovijayji. “Pure intention, the Lord, is firm and steadfast, the one who remembers your name; he attains infinite, unobstructed bliss, the supreme nectar-like abode.” – Shri Devchandraji.

And thus, when the slate of the mind is clean, only then are the letters of the true teachings inscribed upon it. Only then does the soul become a worthy recipient of the true teachings. Therefore, the seeker, the yogi, becomes eager and enthusiastic in the true teachings, becoming thirsty to hear the Dharma-truth. This entire world goes around saying “Dharma, Dharma,” but it doesn’t know the essence of this Dharma. So, what is this Dharma? What is the true essence of Dharma? The seeker remains constantly eager to hear this story of truth from the mouth of the true Guru.

Therefore, Shri Sadguru Bhagwan illuminates: “Raghuvo Dhamo” – “The nature of a thing is its Dharma.” The nature of the self-substance is the self-Dharma, meaning that the soul’s existence in its own nature is called Dharma. Whatever way the soul comes into its own nature – its own essence – that is the true form of Dharma. The state of suppression, gradual suppression, or the state of decay, which ultimately leads to the manifestation of its own qualities, is the means of self-Dharma, which is the nature of the soul. Therefore, it is also Dharma in the form of a means. From the state of Samkiti Guna to the state of Sheleshi, the feelings that follow the soul are dependent on the goal of self-Dharma, and they reveal the cause of production, becoming the purpose of the cleansing of the mind. Therefore, all of these are types of Dharma. And then, when karma is absent in all realms, the complete manifestation of the soul’s qualities in the form of complete bliss, the complete manifestation of the innate nature, that is the unparalleled Dharma in the form of the liberated nature. Thus, the means or the attainment of the goal of Dharma, which is the substance of Dharma, is the true feeling-Dharma. The rest, like name-Dharma, establishment-Dharma, substance-Dharma, field-Dharma, time-Dharma, etc., are types of Dharma, which are good or bad depending on their purpose in relation to feeling-Dharma. Without feeling, all of these are “illusion,” false, and futile. The one who knows and understands this pure substance-Dharma – self-Dharma – or the Dharma-form of the Lord who has manifested this pure Dharma, and worships him, does not bind karma, and he manifests the Dharma in the form of the nature of things.

“I go to the beloved Swami, with joy, a thousand times; the substance-Dharma is fulfilled, the grace of the Lord, the creator, is bestowed. Name-Dharma, establishment-Dharma, and substance, field, and time; they are good only for the purpose of feeling-Dharma, without feeling, all are illusion…” – Swami.

Deepradrushti: The refuge of Dharma, the seed sprouts.
(245) Faith is the lamp, the essence of the self, with a deep devotion,
Devchandra, the Jain, serves the feet of the Jina,
The nature of things is revealed...Swami. - Shri Devchandraji. "The world goes around saying 'Dharma, Dharma',
But they don't know Dharma...Jinesar!
After taking refuge in the feet of the Jinesar,
No one binds karma...Jinesar!
We will sing the praises of the Jinesar Dharma." - Shri Anandghanji.
The way the soul attains self-awareness, that is the way of Dharma...
A living being should not listen, contemplate, or worship Dharma based on the imagination of a father or another man who has attained imagination.
Only from a man who is in the state of the self, can the soul or the Dharma of the soul be heard, and only from such a man can it be worshipped." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
- In this way, when the Sadguru explains Dharma, reveals the essence of Dharma,
Then this seeker, the listener, listens with deep devotion, with eagerness.
And he accepts that Dharma, which is beyond life itself, with all his might,
He is filled with a stream of love for that Dharma, without which he cannot live.
Because it is his nature, so he naturally, spontaneously, takes refuge in the Dharma that is more precious than life, and feels, "Oh Dharma, I have come to you for refuge, protect me."
And he who protects Dharma, is protected by Dharma. "Dharmo rakshati rakshitah."
"Know that Dharma is the well-wisher of all, the worthy of worship! The worthy of worship!
It brings influence; the lonely, the helpless, will become protected,
Without it, no one will be saved." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
That is called the virtue of listening -
क्षाराम्भस्त्यागतो यद्वन्मधुरोदकयोगतः । बीजं प्ररोहमाधत्ते तद्वत्तत्त्वश्रुतेनरः ॥६॥
Just as a seed sprouts from the sweet water, after giving up the salty water,
So too, a man sprouts from the hearing of the truth. 1 वृत्ति: क्षा/मररंथारो चह्ना मधुरोri:-
Just as a seed sprouts from the sweet water, after giving up the salty water,
Even though he is unaware of its sweetness,
He sprouts,
Just as a man sprouts from the hearing of the truth,
Because of the power of the truth, its great influence.

(246)
**Meaning of Yoga-Dristi-Samuchaya:** Just as a seed sprouts from the abandonment of salty water and the force of sweet water, so too does a person attain liberation through the hearing of the principles (Tattva-Shravana).

**Commentary:** Tattva-Shravana is like sweet water, here the seed is the soul. Just as a seed that is in salty water will not sprout, but a seed that abandons salty water and comes in contact with sweet water will sprout, even if it is not aware of the sweetness, similarly, the soul will not sprout as long as it is in the salty water of the worldly ocean. But when it abandons the salty water and comes in contact with the sweet water of Tattva-Shravana, the seed of the soul will sprout and attain liberation. Even if it is not aware of the sweetness of the principles, it will still sprout.

Here, the word "Praha" means to sprout or to ascend to higher levels. Through the inconceivable power of Tattva-Shravana, a person ascends to higher levels of liberation. The word "Nar" (person) is used here because it is primarily humans who are capable of hearing the principles, as it is only in the human form that one can attain complete knowledge and liberation. This is the inconceivable power of Tattva-Shravana.

"Follow the nectar of the words of the Jinas, respect the principles; abandon the attachments to matter and emotions, and embrace the path of the Devchandra." - Shri Devchandraji

"The nectar of the words of the Vitaragas, the root of ultimate peace; the medicine for the disease of birth and death, beneficial for the fearful."

"The tree of the principles, the root of self-righteousness; it achieves the perfection of nature, that is the righteous path." - Shrimad Rajchandraji 

Page #313:
---------------------------
**Deepradrushti:** The seed of truth, watered by the nectar of knowledge, sprouts.

**(247)** Just as the seed of friendship, etc., sprouted in the mind-field, so too does it sprout here, meaning it grows through contemplation. Therefore,

**Prabhubhakti:** Devotion to the Supreme Being, the Lord, increases exponentially. This devotion, which is the ultimate remedy, is characterized by a sprout-like feeling, devoid of the ten senses, including food, and free from desire for fruit.

**Nishkam:** It is selfless. And the mind of the devotee, the yogi, is extremely pure and spotless. Such unhindered devotion transforms the mind into Vaikuntha, the heavenly abode, as the yogis experience. And with such a pure mind, the yogis, filled with supreme love, say to the Lord: "Oh Lord! We will welcome you into our mind-home, and seeing its beauty, you will remain there forever!"

**Man Ghar:** The mind-home is adorned with the abode of the Lord, and the Lord's presence will be seen forever. The Lord resides there; the mind becomes Vaikuntha through unhindered devotion. The yogis speak of this experience.

**Saheba Vasu:** "Saheba Vasu" (The Lord resides) - Shri Yashovijayji.

Here, there is an outpouring of devotion towards the Sadguru, the true guide who leads one onto the path of devotion. There is humility and respect towards the Bhavacharya, the teacher of emotions, and others who are filled with love. And with pure intentions, the devotee serves the ultimate benefactor according to their ability and in accordance with the prescribed rituals. They are dedicated to the Lord's worship with their body, mind, and wealth.

**Satshastrabhakti:** Devotion to the true scriptures, the Sadagamas, the ultimate benefactors and guides, increases exponentially. The scriptures are revered and honored through reading, writing, worship, donation, contemplation, meditation, and study.

**Jinbhakti:** Towards the ultimate seed, the Jinas, there is a feeling of ultimate reverence. Similarly, the natural detachment from the world, arising from the understanding of its true nature, becomes stronger. There is a deep aversion towards the world, which is filled with suffering due to birth, death, and other miseries.

**Ityadi:** All these seeds sprout and grow through contemplation.

**This is the meaning.**

**Ksharam Bhastva Tulya:** The entire world is considered like salty water.

**Madhurodakayogena:** The knowledge of truth is like sweet water.

**Vritti:** The salty water of the world is compared to the knowledge of truth, which is like sweet water.

(248)
The collection of Gadashti is like salty water everywhere, know the Bhavas here;
Tavashruti is like sweet water, 62 meanings - and here the whole world is considered like salty water, and Tattvashruti is considered like sweet water.
The commentary says that the salty water and sweet water mentioned above, what is it? It has been explained here. The whole world is like salty water. The worldly affairs, which are in the form of non-Tattvashravana, are also like salty water. Just as no seed can sprout in salty water, similarly, no good or bad seed can sprout in worldly affairs or non-Tattvashravana, but they are burnt.
As long as a human being has the desire to drink the salty water of this worldly ocean, it is like hoping for a flower in the sky to get a seed. As long as one does not give up drinking this salty water, and does not develop firm detachment in the mind, and does not give up the desire for worldly life, it is not possible for knowledge to arise.
When detachment and dispassion arise in the mind, then knowledge arises; when one stops in detachment and dispassion, then one forgets one's own awareness. - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi
And to the discerning mind, this worldly ocean truly seems salty, and he experiences its bitterness every moment, so he does not want to stay in this world even for a moment. Because he has the feeling of detachment that
"All the relationships that arise in this worldly ocean become a place of disaster for humans." " भवाब्धिप्रभवाः सर्वं संबंधा विपदास्पदम् । संभवन्ति मनुष्याणां तथान्ते सुष्ठु नीरसाः ॥ वस्तुजातमिदं मूढ प्रतिक्षणविनश्वरम् । जानन्नपि न जानासि ग्रहः कोऽयभनौषधः ॥ यद्वद्देशान्तरादेत्य वसन्ति विहगा नगे ! तथा जन्मान्तरान्मूढ प्राणिनः कुलपादपे॥ प्रातस्तरुं परित्यज्य यथैते यान्ति पत्रिणः । स्वकर्मवशगाः शश्वत्तथैते क्वापि देहिनः ॥ शरीरं शीर्यते नाशा गलत्यायुर्न पापधीः । मोह : स्फुरति नात्मार्थः पश्य वृत्त' शरीरिणाम् ॥"
Shri Shubhchandracharyaji's Jnanarnava, the beautiful and heart-touching form of these feelings is described in detail in Shri Shubhchandracharyaji's Shri Jnanarnava, Shrimad Rajchandraji's Bhavanavobodh, and Shri Vinayvijayji Upadhyayaji's Shri Shantasudharas. Those who are particularly curious should see it there. And based on that, it has been said briefly..

Deepradrushti: The feeling of detachment - the world is full of suffering (29) and ultimately proves to be extremely dull. This body is afflicted with disease, youth is afflicted with old age, there is decay and destruction, and at the end of life there is death. The three worlds have been destroyed by indulging in the fleeting pleasures arising from sensory objects. This very thing is constantly perishing, even knowing this, you do not know! Oh fool! It is a defeat or a planet that has no cure! Those who were enemies of defeat before have become my friends in this birth due to karma! And those who were friends of defeat in the previous birth have become my enemies in this birth! Just as birds coming from foreign lands dwell in trees, so too do animals dwell in the tree of the family from birth after birth. Then, as the birds leave the tree and go in their own directions when dawn breaks, so too do these animals, when the morning of the completion of their lifespan arrives, go in different directions according to their karma! Thus, all these birds gather. Yet, see the strange character of animals! The body decays, but hope does not decay! Life is counted, but the mind of sin does not melt! Compassion rains, but the soul does not strive! Truly! Life is as fleeting as the waves of wind, wealth is connected with calamities, all sensory objects are like the colors of clouds at sunset, the happiness of the company of friends, women, relatives, etc. is like a dream-illusion. Therefore, what is there in this world that can cause joy to the saint?
There is no one in these three worlds who has a body who does not have the noose of death around their neck. When steps are taken that cannot be pushed back by Yama-Kesari, even with great effort, life cannot be saved, then what is the fate of the human-worm?”
“Born, aged, died, this world is impermanent;
Everyone experiences karma, no one is a keeper. The refuge is of the Arihant, the refuge is of the Siddha Bhagvant; The refuge is of the Dharma Shri Jain, the refuge is of the virtuous Sadhu.

"The King of the six continents, who ascended and emerged,
Became powerful in the universe, and bore the burden of kingship; those clever, four-wheeled charioteers, who were not,
People know, mind believes, nine times they place someone. With a jeweled crown on their head, they wear ear ornaments,
Wearing golden bracelets, they do not keep any weakness; in an instant, they fall, the lords of the earth, consuming the earth of consciousness,
People know, mind believes, nine times they place someone." "Electric Lakshmi, the lordship, the kite, the lifespan, it is the wave of water;
The bow of Purandari, the endless color, what do you enjoy there, the moment, the occasion? Neither my body, form, radiance, nor the daughter, son, or brother,
Neither my past, loved ones, relatives, nor my lineage or caste; neither my wealth, home, youth, nor the land, the delusion of ignorance, O, O, living beings! Think like this always, the feeling of otherness."
- Shrimad Rajchandraji. Again, those seekers, yogis, feel that -
There is nothing in this world worth even a little attachment to. The wise have called this world endlessly sorrowful, endlessly painful, disorganized, fluctuating, and impermanent. Endless heat,
Endless burning, endless suffering, seeing this, they have renounced this world, it is true. It is not like turning back from that. There, suffering, suffering, the world is suffering. Suffering is that ocean. Because the living being first, in the mother's
Womb - in the womb itself, it endures many torments. Then, born, it suffers many kinds of great hardships, grows up, ah, now the suffering has ended, now it is at peace, where it touches the apparent happiness, the imaginary happiness, there, the death-like old age, the state of decay, devours the body, that is, old age comes, the body begins to deteriorate, and time comes, and snatches away the breath. This is the sorrowful world. From the suffering of the womb to death, the living being is suffering." 4

Two-sightedness:  Salty water of untruth, sweet water of truth.

(251) In this ocean of existence, where the four states of existence are constantly revolving and the fire of suffering is burning, the creatures are wandering endlessly. This machine-bearing being, abandoning one form and taking on another, is constantly assuming new roles like actors on a stage, dancing the drama of this world.  This world is filled with suffering through the five types of transformations: matter, space, time, existence, and emotions. This being, wandering since time immemorial, has experienced all relationships with all beings in the three stationary realms. There is not a single realm, not a single form, not a single country, not a single family, not a single suffering, not a single happiness, not a single state of existence where this being has not wandered and been fragmented.

“In this strange world, gods fall and dogs ascend to heaven!  A learned Brahmin becomes a worm, and a worm or a dog becomes Indra! A king becomes a worm, and a worm becomes Indra! Thus, by the force of karma, beings are transformed!  Oh! In this uneven world, a mother dies and becomes a daughter! A sister becomes a woman! That woman is reborn as a daughter! A father is born as a son! That son dies and becomes a grandson!” Thus, this world is truly impermanent, insecure, full of suffering, strange, and uneven.  Despise this world! Despise it! -  Thus, this wise and detached man thinks.  So, what is surprising that he finds the whole world distasteful? And therefore, rising above it, becoming detached, he strives to abandon the salty waters of this ocean of existence.  What is surprising about that?

Furthermore, what is untruthful is also like salty water.  Since time immemorial, this being has drunk the salty water of untruth, so the seed of truth has not been planted in its heart.  Because the untruthful is tainted by false beliefs, as long as the being continues to hear the untruthful, how can it develop the right understanding?  This being has not left anything out in hearing the salty water, but it has not…
*"चतुर्गतिमहावत्त दुःखवाडवदीपिते । भ्रमन्ति भविनोऽजस्रं वराका जन्मसागरे । रूपाण्येकानि गृह्णाति त्यजत्यन्यानि सन्ततम् । यथा रङ्गेऽत्र शैलूषस्तथायं यन्त्रबाहकः ॥ सर्वैः सर्वेऽपि संम्बन्धा संप्राप्ता देहधारिभिः । अनादिकालसंभ्रान्तैस्त्रसस्थावरयोनिषु ॥ भूपः कृमिभवत्यत्र कृमिश्वामरनायकः । शरीरी परिवर्तत कर्मणा वञ्चितो बलात् ॥ माता पुत्री स्वसा भार्या सैव संपद्यतेऽङ्गजा । पिता पुत्रः पुनः सोऽपि लभते पौत्रिकं पदं ॥”
–from Shri Jnanarnava by Shubhachandracharya.

It has been heard that the subject of the collection of Gadasti is related to the bound, but it has never indicated "Sat", therefore its misfortune has been so far. But now, upon attaining this vision, the living being abandons this salty water of untruthful hearing.
And along with the abandonment of this salty water, the sweet water of Tavasruti-Tattvasravana also arises, hence the seed of knowledge sprouts here. Here, Tattvakriti, meaning the Tattvashastra-Paramartha Shastra, which is the proponent of the truth, is equal to Tattvasruti, like sweet water. And in its other meaning, Tattvakriti (= Tattvasravana) sweet water is also a part of Tattvasruti-Tattvashastra, equal to sweet water. Thus, Tattvashastra and Tattvasravana, which happens through Tattvashastra, are both like sweet water. And the Tattvasravana, which is said to be through Tattvasruti, includes the acceptance of the Sadguru. Because the act of listening happens when something sits, therefore the true speaker of the intention of Tattvasruti-Paramartha Shastra is Shrimad Saru, only through his Shrimuh can Tattvasravana be achieved primarily, or in the absence of Sadguru, the hearing of meaning, through the Vachanamrit-Paramkrit, composed by indirect Sadguru, Sapurusha, also happens. "Tattva Vichar Sudharas Dhara, Guru Gam Vin Kim Pijere?" - Shri Anandghanji.
"Atmaadi Astitva Na, Eh Nirupka Shastra; Pratyaksh Sadguru Veg Nahi, Tyaan Adhar Supatra, Athava Sadguru Ae Kahya, Je Avgahan Kaj; Te Te Nitya Vicharvaan, Kari Matantar Tyaj."
Shrimad Rajchandraprinit Shri Atmasiddhi.
This (Tattvasruti) is called its virtue.
अतस्तु नियमादेव कल्याणमखिलं नृणाम् ।

Paropkar Aadi, Anirun Kunan - everything is for Narene - humans. - Due to the intention of Tattvasruti and its type. It is described as: "Marigunott-Guru Bhakti Na Su Ya Evu Kalyan, Te Ni Aajna Thi Te Na Karan Nu - Karva Nu Tattva Thi Kalyan Panu Chhe, Te Tala Mate. That is why it is said: Chihita Dam - both Lok Ma Hitavah - Dit Aanaaru - Anubandh Nu Guru Bhakti Dvara Say Panu Chhe, Te Ne Lidhe.

**Dimadrusti:** From your hearing, all well-being
(253) By rule, from this, all well-being for humans
Guru-devotion, happiness-filled, both lakes, beneficial place. 63 Meaning: - And from that-truth-action, humans have all well-being by rule, - which is filled with the happiness of Guru-devotion and is beneficial in both lakes.

**Discussion**
You in mind, in wealth, in all, Gurudev's grace, self-soul in you; then your work becomes successful, nectar-juice drink, love-wealth. - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
And from that truth-effort-truth-hearing, by rule, humans attain all well-being like altruism. Because from hearing the good teachings of the holy scriptures, altruism, compassion, charity,
virtue, etc., well-being-making impressions are planted in the soul; and from truth-hearing, therefore, that kind of pure mind-intention manifests, mind-purification, all well-being happens, and as a result, altruism, etc., well-being-giving activities occur.
Meaning - In the 4 matters of desire, even without teaching, people are clever-sharp, but Dharma cannot happen without scripture-hearing, so in that - in that well-being-making scripture, respect the words of the attained holy person, that is beneficial, - is supremely well-being-making. The nectar of words of the supremely compassionate soul Shrimad Rajchandraji is:
"Oh! The nectar of words of a man, gesture, and good company. Awakens the dormant consciousness, keeps the falling tendencies stable, innocent by mere sight, inspires the original nature, form-realization, un-negligent restraint, and the cause of complete non-attachment, non-dual nature, finally reveals the original nature, makes it stand in the infinite, unobstructed form,
Three-time-living, oh! 39 Peace: Peace: Peace" - Shrimad Rajchandra
And that well-being is also filled with the happiness of Guru-devotion, because from the command of Shri Guru, there is well-being. Altruism, etc., well-being-making work, also done with the command of Shrimad Guru Bhagwan, that is from the truth - from the highest purpose - becomes truly well-being-making; done self-willed, it does not become truly well-being-making. So, the Lord, the scripture-maker,
x" उपदेशं विनाप्यर्थकामौ प्रति पटुर्जनः । But not without knowledge, there, the two!" - Shri Gibindu,

The Gadashti Samuchaya opinion is that by abandoning the Guru's command, one abandons the command of the Bhagwan, and by abandoning the Bhagwan's command, one abandons both the Lekas.  "Charity, penance, and virtuous vows, without the Nath's guidance, become obstacles to the cycle of birth and death... Blessed are you! Blessed are you! Blessed are you, Jinraj!"  With such a heart, Devchandra embraced the path of Shiva. - Shri Devchandraji.
Such acts of welfare, performed with the Guru's command, are bound by Anubandha.  This means that they lead to a continuous progression of unique welfare, and the merit of punya-anubandhi punya continuously rises.  Thus, this act of welfare becomes a cause of benefit in both the Lekas, "Lekadrayahitavah" - it becomes a cause of benefit in both the Lekas.
"Magha, Aakhir T" - Shri Jinpravachan.
This (Guru Bhakti) is specifically said to be the ultimate fruit:
"Guru Bhakti Prabhavena Tirthakudarshanam Matam. Samapattyadibhedena Nirvanek Nibandhanam." || 64 ||
Through the influence of Guru Bhakti, the vision of the Tirthankara is considered.  It is the cause of Moksha, through the difference of Samapatti, etc.  64.  Meaning - Through the influence of Guru Bhakti, the vision of the Tirthankara is considered, through the difference of Samapatti, etc., which is the cause of Moksha.
Explanation:  Through the influence of Guru Bhakti, through the strength of Guru Mattika, through the karma-vipak that arises from it, what?  It is considered, it is desired, to see the Tirthankara, to see the Bhagwan.  How?  Through the difference of Samapatti, etc.  Samapatti is the touching through meditation, through which it is done.  The word "adi" refers to the binding, fruition, and the attainment of the Tabahav Apatti of the Namakarma.  (That is, it refers to the binding, arising, and attainment of the Tirthankara Bhava of the Tirthankara Namakarma.)  Such a vision of the Tirthankara is unique - it is the cause of Nirvanainivashvanabhu - Nirvan, it is an extraordinary, unbreakable cause of Moksha.

## Deepradrushti: The Light of Guru Bhakti, the Path to Tirthankara Darshan, the Essence of Samapatti

(55) Commentary: "Where there is supreme knowledge, there is devotion to the Lord. To attain the Lord, one needs a Guru, a true Guru. To recognize the Guru, one needs detachment, and to develop detachment, one needs good fortune." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

The above passage highlights the immense power and efficacy of Guru Bhakti. It is believed by the virtuous that through the influence of Guru Bhakti, one can attain the darshan of the Tirthankara. How is this possible? It is achieved through the various aspects of Samapatti. Samapatti refers to the experience of touching, through meditation, the essence of the Lord, the pure Atma Swaroop. This experience leads to the attainment of Tirthankara Darshan, or the binding of the Tirthankara Karma, which in turn results in the attainment of the Tirthankara Bhaav. Thus, Tirthankara Darshan is achieved. This darshan of the Tirthankara, the Dharma Tirtha Sansthapana, is a unique and unparalleled cause for liberation, an unwavering and extraordinary cause.

Therefore, Guru Bhakti holds immense glory. Through the devotion, service, and worship of the Sadguru, one understands the essence of Shri Jinendra Bhagavan, and attains the darshan of his form. This inevitably leads to the fruit of liberation. This "darshan" is not possible without "drushti," without the eye, without the inner eye. "Without the eye, one cannot attain." This refers to the fact that what is beyond the reach of the physical eye, cannot be attained without the "eye," without the grace of the Sadguru, or without the divine inner eye bestowed by the Sadguru. But those who serve at the feet of the Sadguru, they experience this "beyond the eye" reality. The humble and deserving disciple, through the eye of the Sadguru, attains the divine eye and experiences the essence of the Jina. Thus, the darshan of the pure, inherent bliss of the Lord, which is beyond the senses, is achieved through the divine eye bestowed by the Sadguru. This is the ultimate grace of Shrimad Sadguru Bhagavan. "Ask me about the original state, and I will reveal it to the yogi." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

The Essence of Samapatti: The Samapatti mentioned above is fascinating and worthy of special understanding. Samapatti is the experience of touching through meditation. It is the experience of touching, through meditation, the essence of the object of meditation, the attainment of the true essence of the object, the attainment of the essence of the object. Or, it is the attainment of the essence of the object of meditation, the experience of the self as equal to the object of meditation. To understand this, the example of a crystal gem is used. A pure crystal gem, like a pure soul, can reflect the color of a red or black flower placed near it.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
It is kept above. Its shadow falls on it, and it attains the state of being like that, the state of being like that. Just as a pure mind-jewel meditates, its shadow falls on it, and it attains the state of being like that, the state of being like that, due to the influence of the object being contemplated. Thus, just like a pure crystal gem, those with a subtle mind (1) attain it through 'tārthya', i.e., with unwavering focus, and (2) through 'tad-janapana', i.e., with complete absorption, like the application of collyrium.

Samapatti
There are three main essential conditions for this samapatti to occur: (1) First, the mind must be pure, like a crystal gem, with a subtle mind. This is the qualification for attaining samapatti. (2) Just like a crystal placed near a flower, the mind must be steadily focused on the object being contemplated. If this is not the case, how can samapatti occur? (3) And then, just as the color of the flower falls on the crystal, there must be complete absorption, the object of meditation must be firmly imprinted in the mind. Only when this happens does samapatti occur. Also, these three conditions (Essential conditions) that are essential for samapatti to occur, the previous one is the cause of the next. Because first of all, the essence of the mind must be extremely pure, like a crystal, i.e., the mind must become extremely sattvic. If this does not happen, just as the shadow of a flower does not fall on a stone, so too, the shadow of the object worthy of contemplation does not fall on a polluted mind, samapatti does not occur. But when the mind becomes pure, subtle, transparent, like a crystal, it does not run towards other thoughts. Due to this, it becomes steady and attains focus; and when it attains this focus, it then attains complete absorption. The meaning is that when the mind becomes pure, it becomes steady, and when it becomes steady, it becomes absorbed. Thus, the beginning of samapatti
X "मणिरिवाभिजातस्य क्षीणवृत्तेरसंशयम् ।
તાન્ધ્યાત્ત કારત્વાષ સમાઽત્ત: કથીર્ત્તિતા ૫ શ્રી યશા. કૃત દ્વા॰ દ્વા૦ ૨, ૧૦
* According to the terminology of Patanjali's Yoga Shastra, there are three types of samapatti: grahya, grahana, and grihita. Of these, grahya samapatti is the state of being absorbed in nivichara samadhi, grahana samapatti is the state of being absorbed in sananda samadhi, and grihita samapatti is the state of being absorbed in sasmita samadhi. There are also four types of samapatti: (1) savit, (2) nirvit, (3) savichara, (4) nivichara. This samapatti is called saprajnat samadhi (savikalpa), and it is also called 'sakhij' samadhi. In this, the last nivichara samapatti, when it is immersed, leads to spiritual grace, which gives rise to a knowledge that is greater than shruti and anumana. This knowledge gives rise to tattva-sanskara, which is the destroyer of the karmic residues, and its cessation gives rise to samadhi called asamprajnat (nivikalpa). Through the study of the virama suffix and the remnants of the sanskara of 'naiti neti', this asamprajnat samadhi reveals the true nature of the self, the state of being established in its own form. Thus, nivichara samapatti - spiritual grace → knowledge → tattva-sanskara → asamprajnat samadhi → kaivalya, - this is the order. (For more details, see Patanjali, and Yashvijayji's Dva. Kru. 20).

Deepradrushti: Taviki Paramatma Samapatti; Trividh Atma (257). In this, Chittasthirata is the middle virtue, its importance is indicated by the profound statement of Shrimad Rajchandraji:
“I will tell you after understanding, when the mind becomes stable.”

Now, whose Samapatti? Of which meditation object? It is worth considering. If the object of meditation is inert and the meditator is conscious, how can it be a result of oneness?

Therefore, there is no Tavik+ Samapatti of an inert object through meditation. The Tavik Samapatti is of the soul, which is the object of emotion. And Paramatma is the pure soul, so the Samapatti of Paramatma is the Samapatti of the Jivatma. I am Paramatma, Paramatma is me, “To feel the Paramatma as the self” - this non-dual meditation leads the Jivatma to the Samapatti of Paramatma, because the essence of the soul and Paramatma is one, the essence of consciousness is the same, so their harmonious Samapatti is worthy of non-dual unity. Therefore, “He who knows the self (pure soul) through the qualities of his own essence, he knows the self, and his delusion is destroyed,” said Maharshi Kundkundacharya. _ " जो जाणइ अरहते, दव्वत्तगुणत्तपज्जयत्तेहिं ।
सो जाणइ अप्पाणं, मोहो खलु जाइ तस्स लय ।।" -Shri Pravachansar

The remedy is the creation of many, knowing the one who is pleased; pure essence, quality, and perception in meditation, Shiva gives the Lord's grace. ... Shri Ar” Shri Yashovijayji.
“Meditating on the revealed essence, one becomes aware of one's own essence.” —Shri Devchandraji.

Thus, the reason for the Samapatti of Paramatma is that the power of Paramatma, which is the intimate element of the father, resides in the Jiva. Its individuality, i.e., its manifestation, is in the form of meditation material with the manifested Paramatma, and by obtaining the excellent means of meditation on the manifested Paramatma, the Jiva's inherent power manifests as the manifested Paramatma.

Page #324:
---------------------------
(258)
In the collection of yogic insights and the nature of the soul, the omnipotence of the Supreme Soul is described in three types of souls, as is well-known in the scriptures: * Bahiratma, Antaratma, and Paramatma.
Of these, (1) the one who has the awareness of self in the body, and therefore appears as "I am a student, I am thin," etc., is known as the body or Bahiratma.
(2) The one who does not have the awareness of self in the body, but has it in the soul itself, meaning the one who remains as a witness in the body and resides as the indweller, is the indweller or Antaratma. (3) The one who is completely pure and free from all impurities, and who is the embodiment of the transcendental qualities of the jewels, is the Paramatma.
Of these three types of souls, the Bahiratma is not eligible for meditation and cannot become the meditator, the Antaratma is eligible and can become the meditator, and the Paramatma is the goal worthy of meditation. This is how meditation is used.
Or in other words, abandoning the Bahiratma, becoming the Antaratma, and with a steady mind, to experience the Paramatma as the soul itself, is the practice of Samadhi. The soul is our offering, "Atma Arpan Dav." Just as the reflection of a man's form is reflected in a pure, unchanging mirror, so too is the form of the Supreme Being, Paramatma, reflected in the pure, unchanging Antaratma, meaning that the Paramatma form appears in it as a manifest experience. This is Samadhi.
"Kayadikhe ho Atma Buddhi Grahyo, Bahiratma Aghrup Sugyani; Kayadikhe he Sakhidhar Thai Rahyo, Antar Atmarup Sugyani. Jnana Anandhe he Puran Pavne, Varjit Sakal Upadhi Sugyani; Atindriya Gunaganmani Aag, Im Paramatma Sadh Sugyani. Bahiram Taj Antar, Atmarup Thai Thir Bhav..Sugyani; Paramatma nu ho Atma Bhavvu, Atma Arpan Dav-Sugyani. Sumati Charankaj Atma Arpan, Darpan Jim Avikara..Sugyani" - Shri Anandghanji
From all this, it is evident that the Bahiratma has the potential for Paramatmahood, and therefore, with appropriate effort, it is possible for its manifestation. That is, by abandoning the Bahiratma, and with a pure and steady Antaratma, if one meditates on God-Paramatma with single-pointed focus, then the meditator, the object of meditation, and the goal become one, meaning that meditation
x"बाह्यात्मा चान्तरास्मा च परमात्मेति च त्रयः ।
कायाधिष्ठायकध्येयाः प्रसिद्धायोगवाङ्मये ॥"-500 "बहिरन्तः परश्चेति त्रिधात्मा सर्वदेहिषु । gવેચાત્તત્ર પર મપાયાહૂહિત્ય –સમાધિશતક,

## Diimadrushti: "Bhangi Ilikaane Chatkaave" - Tirthankar Darshan

(259) The one who performs becomes the ultimate self, the goal is achieved, and the complete attainment of the desired is obtained.
"God is the support...mind is the meditator, the goal is inseparable...future. The goal is achieved now...mind, the desired attainment is inseparable...future." - Shri Devchandraji
"Your meditation is the same, that knowledge and character are the same, therefore all sins go away, the meditator is the goal form." - Shri Yashovijayji

Thus, due to the similarity of the substance and its essence, the soul attains the ultimate self, meaning it becomes like that, it becomes like that, it becomes absorbed in that, because whatever one meditates on, one becomes that, is the rule. Here, the example of the bee and the caterpillar is famous. The caterpillar meditates on the bee, it becomes a bee. Shri Anandghanji has exclaimed with utmost enthusiasm: "Whoever worships the Jina, becomes a Jina, the bhangi becomes like the Ilika, the bhangi becomes like the world...the Jina's body is the source of all."

Shrimad Rajchandraji explains this saying as the ultimate Dharma, saying: "By becoming a Jina, meaning by abandoning the worldly feelings and embracing the self-feeling, whoever worships the Jina, meaning the omniscient, the liberated, is certainly a Jina, meaning he is united with the state of liberation. He has given the example of the bee and the caterpillar, which is directly understandable."
"The servant's devotion is given, the Lord is easily attained; whoever meditates with absorption, he truly becomes Devchandra...the old one is yours, your mind is filled with your name."
"The ultimate virtue is the absorption in service, the mind is certainly focused on the meditation;
Experience the pure essence, attain the state of Devchandra." - Shri Devchandraji

Thus, it is said that the attainment, etc., are obtained through the influence of this Tirthankar Darshan - Paramatma Darshan - Guru Bhakti. In other words, due to the ripeness of the virtues arising from the influence of Guru Bhakti, the Paramatma Darshan is attained, or the Tirthankar name karma is bound by Guru Bhakti, it arises, and the attainment of the Tirthankar state is achieved. And the Tirthankar Darshan is also obtained in this way. This Tirthankar Darshan - Paramatma Darshan is the only condition for Nirvana, meaning the unique cause of liberation. It is never attained without it. Its attainment is extremely rare, and... 

Page #326:
---------------------------
(260)
This supreme vision of the Supreme Soul is extremely rare. Upon attaining this supreme vision, Shri Anandghanji, overwhelmed with joy, sang:
“O friend, look at the moon-like face of Chandraprabhu! It quenches the thirst of the senses...friend. Devas and humans serve him...friend. The pain of past karma is gone...friend. The sweet melody is not seen...friend. The great one is beyond description...friend. I have not seen such a sight...friend.
I will not take oil...friend.” etc. (See p. 147). Without attaining this vision of the Tirthankara, this soul has been wandering in this world since time immemorial, and upon attaining it, this soul is liberated from the world. And this attainment is not possible without pure devotion to the Sadhu, without devotion to the holy Guru.
“O Lord, the savior of the world, I pray to you, I beg you to show yourself,
Without your vision, I wander, for an endless and immeasurable time.” - Shri Devchandraji
“Whatever analogy we give for the holy religion embraced by the Nigrantha Bhagwan, it is still inadequate. The soul has wandered for an endless time, only because of the absence of his unique religion, what a style it is!”
- Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter No. 31. (2) What is this supremely wonderful and supremely rare vision of the Tirthankara? It has many meanings. For example: (1) Vision of the Prabhu's mudra - the image that establishes the form of the state of being free from attachment,
(2) General, gross vision of the Tirthankara's qualities, (3) True vision of the Tirthankara, as a result of seeing the truth, becoming a Tattvadrashta, (4) Direct vision - realization of their various forms of the Supreme Soul, etc. This vision is beneficial in countless ways, in every way, in every way. The first three types are also beneficial because they are the cause of the fourth type. And this supremely beneficial vision of the Tirthankara is understood only through the supremely beneficial Shrimad Sadguru, therefore the greatest benefit is to Shrimad Sadguru Bhagwan.
“Without the teachings of the Sadguru, the form of the Jina cannot be understood; without understanding, what is the benefit? At the time, the form of the Jina.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji, author of Shri Atmasiddhi

Deemadrushti: The characteristic of Soombhedh, the method of justice in Tany Nirnay.
Here, it is said to show the characteristic of Soombhedh that is prohibited -
Samyaghe tvadadibhenden loke yastattvanirnayah | Vedysamvedya padatah sukshmabodhah sa uchyate ||65|| Samyag hetu aadithi je tattvanirnayaj janmaany;
Vidysamvedya padathi-te, sukshma bhedh kahevaay. 65. Meaning - Samyag hetu, etc., by making a distinction, in the world, the tattvanirnay that happens through the Vedysamvedya pad, is called sukshma bodh.
Discussion
“Soombodh te pan ihaaji, samakit vin na hoy; Vedysamvedya pade kaheyo chhe, te na avelve jey...manmehan.”–Shri . D. Sajay 5
It was said above that Soombodh is not yet in this drushti, to clarify that, what is “sukshmabodh”? Its explanation is here. By the form and fruit of the hetu, in the learned society, in the community of pandits, the tattvanirnay that is done through the Vedysamvedya pad, that is, the parmarth is dissected, the knowledge of parmarth is gained, that is called “sukshma bodh”.
The method of justice in Tattvanirnay
To decide any tattva, it is the work of true pandits - truly learned, because they are the ones who, through the hetu, form, and fruit, examine the tattva properly, test it properly through kash-ched-tap, etc., and are able to decide the tattva - parmarth. They are above all attachment, and examine the tattva impartially through the method of justice. Just as a skilled judge - justice-judge maintains the balance of justice properly and impartially, so these justice-loving learned people also compare the tattva impartially, because they are experts in the method of justice. They do this in the following way -
Vrittisajoo-sabhyapane, aviparit vidhithi, ri -hetu aadi bhedathi; hetu, swaroop ne kalna bhedathi, dholakma, that is, in the learned society, chatursanirnay - the tattvanirnay, parmarth paricched. For what reason? Because - ghavath - Vedysamvedya pad thaki, the characteristic of which is said to be the daavedya pad thaki, sukshmaposh: sa 32 te - te sakshmadh, nipun bhedh kahevaay chhe, that is the meaning.

## The Fourfold Insight (Chaugdasht)
(262)

Along with this,
1. In establishing the truth, the judge first determines the **sadhya** (the thing to be proved), establishes some aspects of the **sadhya** that are acceptable, and ensures that they are not contradicted by direct perception, etc. They know that this **sadhya** illuminates the purpose, so it should be pursued, otherwise it will lead to a state like a mine without a target. (5) Thus, having determined the **sadhya**, they consider its purpose. The **sadhya** is inseparable from the **hetu** (reason), meaning the **sadhya** cannot exist without the **hetu** - this is called the purpose. The relationship between the **sadhya** and the **hetu** is inseparable, meaning they cannot exist without each other. Therefore, through **upatti** (affirmative reasoning) and other forms of **anupatti** (negative reasoning), the **sadhya** is established through the application of the **hetu**. This **anupatti** means that it happens in this way, not in any other way, and is a characteristic of the **hetu**. If there is a lack of understanding, doubt, or contradiction, it is called **hetvabhas** (fallacious reasoning). These discerning individuals diligently avoid **hetvabhas**. ( ) Thus, having established the **sadhya** through the **hetu**, they strengthen it with **drushtaant** (example). Where the relationship between the **sadhana** (means) and the **sadhya** is specifically determined through memory of the relationship, it is called **sadhannya drushtaant**; and where the **sadhya** is negated, the **sadhana** is also considered impossible, it is called **vaidhya drushtaant**. If the **sadhya** is established through internal pervasiveness, it is a **khady** example, otherwise, in its absence, it is a **vyatha**. (3) While strengthening with such **drushtaant**, these knowledgeable judges do not allow **drushtaant desha** (flaws in the example) arising from **asiddha** (unproven), **apratiti** (unrealized), **anyathapanna** (otherwise established), **viruddha** (contradictory), and **anaikantika** (non-categorical) **sadhamma** (reasoning). Similarly, they do not allow **sadhyavikal** (flaws in the **sadhya**) etc. arising from **apalaksan** (unclear) **hetu**. And they carefully avoid **drushtaant desha** arising from **vaidhyamya** (lack of validity). Thus, these discerning individuals, skilled in **anumana** (inference) and **pramana** (proof), establish the existence of the truth through the correct **hetu** and strengthen it with flawless **drushtaant**.

**Sadhya, Hetu, and Drushtaant**

2. The second thing in establishing the truth is to consider the nature of the truth. That is, what is the nature and characteristics of the truth? What are its general and specific qualities? They consider this. Every thing is multi-faceted, and the **naya** (perspective) is that which grasps one aspect or part of it. This **naya**, which is rooted in the **shrutamag** (scriptural teachings) of the **eknishtha** (single-minded) **naya**, leads to complete and certain knowledge through its activity.

## Deepradrusti: How is the subtlety of knowledge? (263) It is called Syadvadamrit. They resort to this as a support to understand the standard self-opinion condition in the form of a current. Let the Shruta-knowledge take the path of Nay, experience the taste. - Shri Devchandraji. 3. The third thing in Tattvanirnay is to determine what it is. That is, having determined the form of a certain principle, having made it certain, what is its fruit, what is its result, and how is the fruit-like attainment of the present principle achieved, how is the present principle produced-proven, they consider its failure. The fruit of the standard omniscience is the direct removal of ignorance, the fruit of Kevalgyan is happiness and indifference, and the fruit of the rest of the knowledge is the production of grasping-renunciation intellect, that is, the production of discriminating intellect in the form of grasping the truth and renouncing the untruth. Darkness is ignorance, knowledge is light. - Shrimad Rajchandraji. Thus, the scholar determines the principle correctly, as it is, without contradiction, from the purpose, from the form, and from the fruit, makes the ultimate truth certain, and the reason why he can do it is the attainment of the Vedya-Sanvedya pad. Vedya means that which is known, where it is perceived, known correctly, experienced, that is called Vedya-Sanvedya pad. Its form will now be told by the author, the sage. This non-contradictory Tattvanirnay which happens due to the Vedya-Sanvedya pad, is called "subtle knowledge". Here, he specifically mentions the cause of activity: भवाम्भोधिसमुत्तारात्कर्मवनविभेदतः  /  ज्ञेयव्याप्तेश्च कात्स्न्येन सूक्ष्मत्वं नायमत्र तु  // 66 //  Vritti: - Mavaazmodhittumuttarah - from the liberation from the ocean of existence, from crossing the ocean of the world, by doing so, due to the purposefulness of the transcendental activity. Tatha Varmashtraviratah - from the distinction of the karma-like weight, - from the non-repetition, by doing so. Yajna Sharchan - and by the work of Yavyaapti - completely, comprehensively, - by the attainment of the infinite Dharma-like principle, by doing so, Sukshmavan - subtlety, subtlety, the expertise of knowledge. Nayamatra tu - but (this) this subtle knowledge is not here. Here means it is not in Deepradrusti and the lower perspectives. Due to the non-establishment of the distinction of the nine Nayas, x नयानामेकनिष्ठानां प्रवृत्तेः श्रुतवमनि  /  सपूनार्त्विधि थाकूबतमुचरे || - Nyayavtar, * " प्रमाणस्य फलं साक्षादज्ञानविनिवर्त्तनम्  /  वरुध्ध गुनोपेक्से वाचकानाफ्राधीः " - Nyayavtar,

The collection of Gadasti (Jain scriptures) is a guide to liberation from the ocean of existence, through the differentiation of karma, and the all-pervasiveness of the soul. However, this subtle nature is not perceived in this limited vision. 

**Meaning:** The subtle nature of the soul is revealed through liberation from the ocean of existence, the differentiation of karmic matter, and the all-pervasiveness of the soul. However, this subtle nature is not perceived in this limited vision.

**Explanation:** The text explains the subtle nature of the soul through three points:

1. **Liberation from the ocean of existence:** The soul, when liberated from the cycle of birth and death, experiences a subtle state of being. This liberation is achieved through spiritual practices and detachment from worldly desires.
2. **Differentiation of karmic matter:** The soul is bound by karmic matter, which creates suffering. The subtle nature of the soul is revealed through the differentiation and elimination of this karmic matter.
3. **All-pervasiveness of the soul:** The soul is all-pervasive and infinite. This subtle nature is not perceived in this limited vision, which is restricted by the senses and the mind.

The text concludes by stating that the subtle nature of the soul is not perceived in this limited vision. This is because the soul's true nature is beyond the reach of the senses and the mind.

**Deepradrishti:** The comprehensive and collective understanding of the multifaceted nature of all things (265) (3) and the infinite-natured, undivided essence of all things, leads to the profoundness of this knowledge. Because *Syadvada* is the unshakeable, all-knowing, and all-encompassing rule of the multifaceted nature of all things; and it teaches that all things are multifaceted, because all things are inherently multifaceted. What is, is also not; what is one, is also many; what is real, is also unreal; what is eternal, is also non-eternal - this is the multifaceted nature, which reveals the existence of a thing through the manifestation of two opposing forces. Thus, the Jain doctrine, which is established by the principle of multifaceted nature, is well-organized. This "multifaceted nature" is the lifeblood of the *Parmagam*. It is the ultimate, generous, profound, and all-encompassing principle that resolves the disputes of the blind men about the elephant, and eliminates the contradictions of all viewpoints. Because it examines the complete form of all things from different perspectives, keeping in mind different viewpoints, it ends the petty quarrels that arise from conflicting opinions, and leaves no room for any kind of vote-grabbing.  Captivated by the miraculous, all-solving nature of this multifaceted principle, which is the lifeblood of truth, the ultimate knowers of truth have declared with generous confidence: "There is no system of truth without the multifaceted nature," and this is absolutely true.

(266) The collection of Gidastis (Gidastisamuccaya) thus completely grasps the infinite-dharmic (anantdharmatmak) and undivided (akhaṇḍ) reality (vastutattva) as a whole. That is, in every object (vastū) and dharma, there are infinite dharmas, the reality (vastutattva) is anekanta, yet the object is undivided (akhaṇḍ) and non-dual (abheda) - this is how the reality (vastutattva) is understood as a whole. Therefore, this understanding is subtle (sūfma). If we say something is real (vastū), then its dharmas are infinite (anant lahajē); the abode of the general and the specific, it is the result of dravyastika... - Swami Sujata. "The infinite-dharmic reality (anantdharmatmak vastū) is here, the rule of syadvada is an umbrella; the syadvada seal, whoever takes it, takes the whole (sarvasva) as his king." - (De. Bhagvandas) Thus, due to the vastness of the ocean of existence (bhavasamudra), due to the differentiation of karma (karmavāna), and due to the complete understanding of the reality (vastutattva) - this understanding is subtle (sūm), but this subtle understanding does not manifest in this vision (dṛṣṭi), nor in the visions (dṛṣṭi) below it, because there is a lack of differentiation of the knots (granthibheda) from the reality (tattva). 

"अवेद्यसंवेद्यपदं यस्मादासु तथोल्बणम्  /  पक्षिच्छायाजलचरप्रवृत्त्याभमतः परम्  // 67 //" 

The place (pada) is unperceivable (agha-sanvedya), it is so strong (ulbaṇ); another is like the activity of aquatic creatures in the shadow of a bird (pakṣicchāyā jalacara pravṛtti). 67. Meaning - Because in these first four visions (dṛṣṭi), the unperceivable (avedya-sanvedya) place (pada) is strong (ulbaṇ) in this way; and another such unperceivable (avedya-sanvedya) place (pada) is like the activity of aquatic creatures in the shadow of a bird (pakṣicchāyā jalacara pravṛtti). 

It was said above that subtle understanding (vivecana sūm bodha) is not present in these four visions (dṛṣṭi) - Mitra etc. - the reason for this is that here the unperceivable (agha-sanvedya) place (pada) is strong (ulbaṇ); and from this, the activity (vṛtti) - the unperceivable (avedya) place (pada) - whose characteristic is to be described, is like the activity of aquatic creatures in the shadow of a bird (pakṣicchāyā jalacara pravṛtti) - because in these four visions (dṛṣṭi) - Mitra etc. - it is so strong (tathoravaḷ), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place (pada), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place (pada), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place (pada), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place (pada), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place (pada), it is strong (ulbaṇ) in the way of the unperceivable (nivrutti) place

**Deepraashti Avegha Savaidya Pad Prabhal: Vedha Sangh Atatvik (267)**

The second - the opposite, that which is Vedya-Sanvedya Pad, is not Tatvik here, but is Mithya-Atatvik, like the activity of an aquatic creature towards the shadow of a bird. Just as a bird flies in the sky, its shadow falls in the water, and some aquatic creature, mistaking the shadow for the bird, tries to catch it - runs after it, but since nothing comes into its hands, its effort goes in vain - Mithya; similarly, this Vedya-Sanvedya Pad, even in the four Dristi, is like the aquatic creature's futile activity after the shadow, like a shadow-like, frog-like, futile activity, it is not the real, Tatvik (Real, Genuine) purpose, it is Mithya shadow-like (shadow-like), it is only a semblance. Because the Granthibhed has not yet happened here, so the attainment of Tatvik Vedya-Sanvedya Pad does not happen, but Atatvik Vedya-Sanvedya Pad is here in these four Dristi of Mitraadi, and that too is obtained only by the last Yathapravrittakaran, as Acharya Bhagwan has said, because when the Karmavivararoop Piliye Dwarapaal opens the Pool, that is, the entrance of the Tattamndir, then only the true Tatvadarshan happens. "Bhav Anantma Darshan Dithu, Prabhu Ehva Dekhaadeji; Vikat Granth Je Pal Piliye, Karmavivar Ughaadechhe......... Sev Bhaviyaan Vimala Jisesar" - Shri Yashovijayji. This form of Yathapravrittakaran etc. has been mentioned earlier in the description of the first Dristi. When the Bhavmal of the Jiva becomes very weak, then this last Yathapravrittakaran - Atmaparinamvishesh is obtained by the Jiva residing in the last Pudgalavarta. Due to Yathapravritta, an unprecedented joy of Atmaviya arises, "Apoovarakaran happens. Karanaadi and after that, Samyaktva cannot be obtained without it - it cannot be avoided, it is "Anivrittikaran". In it, until the Jiva reaches the Granthi, there is Yathapravrittakaran, before Granthibhed, there is Apoovarakaran, and when Granthibhed is done and the Jiva becomes inclined towards Samyaktva, there is Anivrittikaran. This ultimate Yathapravrittakaran is obtained in the first four Dristi. But the attainment of Samyaktva happens only from the fifth Dristi, until the first four Dristi, it is only Mithyatva. (See page 46, 170) Thus, in the first four Dristi, Mithyatva is the nature, so "Avedya-Sanvedya Pad" is of the Ulban-Utkat type, very strong, so the Jiva's Mehdasha still exists due to Dasanamaha. And the Vedya-Sanvedya Pad that is here is not the Tatvik-Vastavik purpose of the Sthal Badha, but it is a semblance - a shadow-like Atatvik.

(268). The Gyadashtisamuchya is such that the knowledge state of the soul is not there. Therefore, in the first four dristi, whatever bondage of knowledge of the soul is seen, it is only superficial and superficial, it is of a gross nature, but it is not subtle, which is deep and mysterious. Those who consider themselves knowledgeable from the above - by reading books or knowing something from here and there, from superficial knowledge of the truth, or those who are dry spiritualists who sit on the cream of the experience of the knowledgeable, "ready-made goods", have a lot to learn, this is a lot to learn from the above. Because the attainment of Samyaktva is a very high state attained in the fifth dristi, as mentioned above, and before its attainment, one has to attain the previous four dristi or the previous qualities, which has been described in detail in each dristi. It is true that "without attaining the Gunasthan, the eligibility for Samyaktva is also not attained. Yet, without such a self-feeling, without such a knowledge state without compassion, to imagine the father as a "knowledgeable" is just an "imagination", and it is equal to deceiving one's own soul. Because "the fruit is of the state, not of the belief" - this supreme truth-statement of Shrimad Rajchandraji is exactly applicable here. Where there is decay of compassion or where there is peace of mind, that is called the state of knowledge, otherwise it is called madness. "The whole world is like a dream, or like a dream; that is called the state of knowledge, otherwise it is called verbal knowledge" - Atmasiddhi by Shrimad Rajchandraji. Why is this so? For that he says - अपायशक्तिमालिन्यं सूक्ष्मबोधविबंधकृत्  /  नैतद्वतोऽयं तत्तत्त्वे कदाचिदुपजायते  // 68 //  Apayashakti malitya kare, sukshma bodh pratibandh eh-vantane tattvama, kadi na a upjat. 68. Meaning - The impurity of Apayashakti is a hindrance to subtle knowledge, therefore, this subtle knowledge never arises in those who have this impurity of Apayashakti. 1 Truth - Apayamarive Apayashakti's malitya, Narakad Apayashakti's malitya, what? It is - sukshmavigandha-sukshma bodh ne vibandh-pratibandh karanaaru chhe, because Apayahitu is its consumption-like kilesha seed, therefore. Nitadachan this Apayashakti's malitya wala ne a-sukshma bandh nathi, tat-therefore, tarve-tattva vishayma, rahunate-kadi upja, avany eva sthula bebijna bhavathi-hovapa nathi.

##  Diimadrushti: Subtle Knowledge-Obstructing Apay-Shakti Malinya (269)

The discussion above stated that in the four drushtis of Mitra, etc., the adyasamvedya pad is strong, but the tatvik, vevasamvedya pad is not the goal, and therefore subtle knowledge is not present here. The reason for this is explained here with a clear exposition of the apay shakti. The malinya, which is the shakti-rupa of the apay like hell, etc., is the one that obstructs and hinders subtle knowledge. This is because the seed of the apay hetu, like hell, etc., which is the cause of kilasht karma, is still present here, remaining in its shakti-rupa. What is this apay? "The previous karma known as nirupkarma is the apay, says the nirpay purusha. This apay-rupa, strange karma, generates papa aashay." And as long as the seed of this apay-rupa, kilasht karma, which generates papa aashay, remains in its shakti-rupa, it does not allow subtle knowledge to arise. This is because it generates such a malinya in the chitta that subtle knowledge cannot enter and become subtle bodha. Just as clear letters cannot be written on a dirty cloth, similarly, as long as the cloth of the chitta is malinya, subtle knowledge, like clear letters, cannot be written on it. Just as water does not settle on a greasy surface, similarly, on the chitta-bhumi, which is greasy with kilasht karma malinya, the nirmal jal, which is subtle knowledge, does not settle or enter. As long as this apay-bija-rupa kido is eating away at the inside, there is no hope of the birth of tatva-samvadhi suddha. Until then, whatever is bound will remain only as a pile of emptiness. This is because the apay-bija, which remains in its shakti-rupa, becomes an obstacle to subtle knowledge. Not only that, but there is also the possibility of it becoming a tree and bearing fruit, which is the result of such a nimitta. As long as the seed of the disease is not gone, the disease is not eradicated, the tree cannot say when the disease will erupt or strike. Similarly, as long as the apay-bija is present, it cannot be known when it will erupt and bloom, spoiling the health of the soul. Thus, this malinya of apay shakti truly becomes apay (ap + aay), because it causes apay, the acquired benefit slips away. "Apayma. Nipaya: The old picture of papa-aay is not a sign of..." - Gabinda.

(270) The collection of yogic insights goes, that is, whatever benefit is obtained without the subtle knowledge of the subtle knowledge, it goes away without giving the desired result. And thus, the impurity, which is the seed-form, the power-form of such a giving-killing, is not attained by the subtle knowledge, that is, there is no knowledge of the secret of the subject matter, there is no deep understanding of the truth of the subject matter. Even in these four insights of friend etc., the knowledge related to the subject matter must be present, because there is the presence of the seed of the knowledge of the place, which is unbreakable, unyielding, and infallible, and because it is unbreakable, it becomes the cause of the future auspicious fruit, that is, the future subtle knowledge. Subtle knowledge is also not without this world, without power. - It is said. This is so, therefore - अपायदर्शनं तस्माच्छ्रतदीपान तात्त्विकम्  /  तदाभालंबनं त्वस्य तथा पापे प्रवृत्तितः  // 69 //  The vision of giving is not true from the lamp of scripture; it is due to the activity of sin, it is the appearance of that, 60 Meaning - Therefore, the vision of giving from the lamp of the form of the deed is not the true purpose, but it has the support of its aura - the appearance of that, because there is its activity in sin in that way. Discussion - Thus, due to the impurity of the power of giving, the knowledge of the place is present, but the subtle knowledge is not present, therefore, by the lamp of the scripture, the vision of giving of those who have this insight, that is, the tendency - giving-giving - vision of giving, the vision of giving - the vision of sin, therefore, from the scripture-scripture-form lamp, from the scripture, it is not true, it is not transcendental, there is a relationship between this - this. The transcendental one - but it is due to the delusion of having the support of its aura, the transcendental subject matter. (That is, there is the vision of giving in the form of the appearance of that, the appearance of the transcendental, not the vision of that). Why? Because - तथा Tamત્તિ: in that way, there is activity in sin in that way, in that way, in an unknown way, there is activity in sin, therefore. Explanation - What - that is, in giving, in the sin-form,

**Deepradrusti:** The vision that arises from the karmic defilement, which is the result of the school of thought that is based on the Agamas, is not truly insightful or liberating. It is merely an illusion of the true nature of reality, a distorted perception of the truth. The Agamas, like a lamp, illuminate the lake of existence, revealing the true nature of all things. They show the true nature of karmic defilement, which obscures the true nature of the soul, and guide us to the path of liberation.

Just as the lamp of the Agamas reveals the true nature of the soul, which is pure, wise, and filled with consciousness, so too does it reveal the karmic defilement that obscures this true nature. This defilement, which is the result of past actions, leads the soul to wander through the cycle of birth and death. It is through the accumulation of karmic defilement that the soul becomes bound to the cycle of existence.

The ten virtues, such as non-violence, truthfulness, and non-stealing, help to prevent the accumulation of new karmic defilement. Through austerity, the old karmic defilement is gradually eradicated. When all karmic defilement is destroyed, the soul is liberated and its true nature is revealed.

The karmic defilement is like darkness, while liberation is like light. The soul is pure and full of consciousness, and it is only through liberation that it can experience its true nature. The path to liberation is the path of understanding the causes of karmic defilement and eliminating them.

The Agamas, like a lamp, illuminate the true nature of reality and guide us to the path of liberation. However, due to the karmic defilement that obscures our vision, we may not fully understand the true nature of reality. Even when we see the karmic defilement, we may not fully understand its true nature.

(272) The term "Gadasti Samuchaya" refers to a gross, illusory perception of the bondage of karma. It is like a shadow, superficial and fleeting. This gross perception creates an illusion of bondage, but it does not leave a deep, lasting impression on the mind. Therefore, it appears as if this gross perception binds the soul to karma, rebirth, etc., but it is only an illusion. This is because the soul, even with the knowledge gained through Shrauta Shravana, etc., still engages in various minor sins due to ignorance. This indicates that the soul has not yet truly realized the consequences of karma, such as hellish realms. If it had, it would be terrified by the infinite suffering of those realms and would avoid sin, becoming fearful of it. It would not engage in any sinful activities, even unknowingly, and would stay far away from them. 

Therefore, the other, more subtle, perception of the bondage of karma is like placing one's foot on hot iron. 

**Verse 7:**

"Other than the perception of the bondage of karma, which is not directly perceived, there is another perception, which is perceived by the last four types of vision. This perception, due to the transgression of karma, leads to sinful activities, which are like placing one's foot on hot iron."

**Explanation:**

This verse refers to the subtle perception of the bondage of karma, which is not directly perceived but is perceived by the last four types of vision. This perception, due to the transgression of karma, leads to sinful activities, which are like placing one's foot on hot iron. This is because the soul, even though it has a subtle perception of the bondage of karma, still engages in sinful activities due to ignorance. This is like placing one's foot on hot iron, which is a painful experience that one would avoid if one had a clear understanding of the consequences.

## Diimadrusti:

The **takhtaloha pad** (firm ground) is the **vyasavritti** (activity) of the **bhav** (emotion) that is **apratibandh** (unrestricted) (273).  The **adyasavedya pad** (directly perceivable state) mentioned above is different from the **vedasavedya pad** (scripturally perceivable state), which exists in the previous four **drushtis** (perspectives) - **sthira** (stable), etc.

Due to the supreme influence of this **vedyasavedya pad**, the **jogi** (ascetic) with this **drushti** does not engage in **taptahapad** (burning state) activities, whether in **apaya** (hell) or **pap** (sin). Even if they engage in **nyasavritti** (activity of placing) due to **desh** (demerit) of **purvakarma** (past karma), this activity is like placing something on a hot iron. Just as one immediately feels a shock when placing their foot on a hot iron and does not stay there for long, immediately withdrawing it, similarly, the **mahaatma** (great soul) with this **drushti**, the **samyagdrusti purush** (person with right vision), is **pap-bhiru** (fearful of sin) and fears sin. Even if, due to the transgression of **karma**, they unknowingly engage in **himsa** (violence) or other **pap** (sin), they immediately feel a shock and do not stay in sin for long, immediately turning back - **pratikram** (repentance). They engage in this activity with **niraspana** (indifference) and **antarang khed** (inner regret), not from **atmabhav** (ego), nor from **nirvas parinam** (desire for results), but out of compulsion due to **purvakarma** (past karma).

This **samyagdrusti jeev** (soul with right vision) is **kayapati** (body-bound) and **kayapati** (body-bound), but their downfall is only through the **kaya** (body). They do not fall into **pap** (sin) through the **chitta** (mind) alone, and they do not engage in **papkriya** (sinful activity) with **chitta** (mind). Their **chitta** (mind) is in **moksha** (liberation), while their **sharira** (body) is in **sansar** (world). **Ri ma tanu** (This is the body). Therefore, all their activities related to **dharma** (righteousness), **artha** (wealth), etc., are **garup** (heavy). Their actions are like those of **Shri Krishna** and others, **udasina** (detached).

When **samyattva** (right conduct) arises in a **jeev** (soul), all their **sansari** (worldly) activities happen **rasarahit** (without attachment). There is no activity that causes **bhrant** (delusion) regarding **parmarth** (ultimate goal). As long as there is no **bhrant** (delusion) regarding **parmarth** (ultimate goal), **niraspana** (indifference) in other activities does not hinder **samyaktva** (right conduct).

...

The **samyagdrusti jeev** (soul with right vision) appears to be engaged in the world, but they are bound by the previous **nibandhan** (bondage). **"Yatin pad vodhisattv: pavita na chittapatinastavdetadatrapi yuktimat // bhinnagranthestu yatpraayo moksha chitta bhavetanu / taray taras ivenndra chono golo hi mavat: "** - Shri Yogabindu.

(274) The collection of *gaddhasti* is seen due to *prarabdha karma*. In reality, it does not decrease in the world due to *bhaava*. It decreases due to the fear of the arising of past *karma*. Therefore, to the extent that there is no *bhaava* restriction, to that extent the *samyakdarshti* is present in that being. It is true that infinite *krodha*, *maana*, *mayaa*, and *lebha* cannot occur except for *samyakattva*. x x x The characteristic of the path of *paramartha* is that the being becomes cowardly in all ways while engaging in the *aparamartha*, whether in happiness or in sorrow. Cowardice in sorrow is also possible for others. But cowardice in the attainment of worldly happiness, the dislike of that happiness, the dullness, is that of a man who desires *paramartha*. (See for details) - Shrimad Rajchandra. Letter No. 375. (459) Thus, the entire worldly activity of a *samyakdarshti* man is without *bhaava* restriction, it is with detached *bhaava*. The best example of this is Shri Jinendra Bhagwan. Even when he was living as a householder, he was dwelling with supreme *vairagya*. He was *bhegi* yet *gi*. He remained in the world like water on a lotus leaf, detached. This later picture of his character has been beautifully depicted in words full of *bhaava* by the great poet and scholar, Acharya Yashvijayji Upadhyayji, "Even though the mind of the people is filled, but *vairagya* for the three times; your mind is like the ocean, it does not get any *taag*..." Shri Shreyans, please do *kripa*. Shri Yashvijayji "यदा मरुन्नरेंद्रश्रीस्त्वया नाथोपभुज्यते  /  यत्र तत्र रतिर्नाम विरक्तत्वं तदापि ते  // " - Shri Hemchandracharya's Shri Vitragastava. And such a bright, living, vibrant example has been provided in the present age by a supreme spiritual *samyakdarshti* *vitraga* man like Shrimad Rajchandraji, from his father's excellent spiritual character. It is evident to those who understand his *vachanamrita* with a middle *bhaava*, which is interwoven with his spiritual life. For example, night and day, there is only contemplation of the subject of *paramartha*. Food is also the same, sleep is also the same, lying down is also the same, dreams are also the same, fear is also the same, *bhega* is also the same, *parigraha* is also the same, movement is also the same, sitting is also the same. 

Page #341:
---------------------------
**Right Vision:** The state of being detached from the worldly activities of the Samsara, being indifferent to them (275). What more can be said? Bones, flesh, and their mixture are all of the same color. Even a ram knows this. "The state of the mind remains conscious, so we perform all the actions of our dealings with great disorder." We are indifferent to such confusion. We have supreme detachment from worldly dealings, never allowing them to touch us. Just as our mind is like an eye, and the eye cannot tolerate even a speck of dust, so too is our mind, which is like an eye, and cannot tolerate anything else. XXX Despite this state, we cling to attachments with great force. This is a difficult thing to understand, because it is like trying to pick up sand near the eye; just as this is painful, extremely painful, so too is the result of attachments to the mind. The mind, being in a state of ease, experiences pain in the right way, experiences it in a state of unbroken samadhi." etc. (For more, see) Shrimad Rajchandra.

From the above, it can be understood that a being with Right Vision will rarely commit sins, and if they do, perhaps due to the influence of past karma - the arising of prarabdha - they will commit only a little, and even then, they will not do so with a detached result, so they will not be bound. Even a being with Right Vision, when they commit a sinful act, will feel a shock, like putting a bare foot on hot coals, they will feel fear, and deep down in their heart, they will feel immense regret from the true feeling of their mind. Because, who, having tasted even a drop of the nectar of samkiti, would like other tastes like bakasbuka?

"You know the taste of samkiti nectar, you have served the sinful karma for many days; serve the karma that is destined, the samkiti nectar is written in it. Know that you who have tasted even a drop of your virtues, will not like other tastes. He who has tasted even a drop of the nectar of love, will not like other tastes." - Shri Yashovijayji

Why is this the case? He says - x "सम्मविट्ठी जीवो जइवि हु पावं समायरे किंचि  /  कपाणि हौ वंघो ना निधë कुळg / Shri Pratikramanasutra - Vanditta Sutra

##  Dimādr̥ṣṭi: The Immense Glory of Samyagdṛṣṭi with Intense Zeal (277)

This activity is due to the intense zeal, which is the result of the attainment of the Vedhasamvedya-pada. Because when Samyagdṛṣṭi arises, the true nature of the ocean of existence is revealed, the terrible, infinitely painful nature of the world is directly perceived, and the infinite, blissful nature of the soul is directly experienced. Therefore, such a being does not play in this painful, fearful world, but just as one runs away from a place of fear or with clenched fists, so too does this Samyagdṛṣṭi, the seeker of liberation, runs away from this world with intense zeal. For a moment, the allure of the world does not seem attractive to him. The supreme, zeal-filled words of Shrimad Rajchandraji are: "O Lord! When the pain of the seventh, scorching hell is experienced, one agrees. But the information of the world does not agree." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. No. 58 (85)

Or, zeal means an intense desire for liberation, a strong desire for liberation. The Samyagdṛṣṭi man has tasted the supreme bliss of his own true nature, he tastes the wonderful, pure nectar, so naturally his innate self-realization runs towards his innate, natural state with intense zeal. That is, he has an intense desire to be free from all worldly attachments, to be free from all karmic bondage, and to attain liberation, which is his true nature, as soon as possible. Because he feels that birth, death, old age, disease, sorrow, etc., are only causes of suffering for those who are tormented by this terrible ocean of existence, and the only cause of happiness is liberation, which is free from birth, etc., suffering, free from the power of fear, and always free from suffering.

And because of this intense desire for liberation, he also has a strong interest in the means of liberation, such as devotion, affection, etc., which are the means of liberation. Because the cause leads to the accomplishment of the work, this unshakeable, timeless principle, unaffected by the three times, establishes devotion in his heart. Therefore, he has intense zeal, full enthusiasm, and supreme self-excitement towards devotion, affection, etc. towards the Lord. "Birth, death, and the winds of suffering are only causes of suffering for men. The ocean of existence is terrible. But liberation is the supreme happiness, free from birth, etc., suffering." - Shastravarta Samuccaya.

(278) The collection of right faith (Samyak-darshan) is extremely joyful. And just as a flood of water cannot be stopped, so too, this instrument (Samyak-darshan) cannot be stopped from being extremely fast, energetic, and unstoppable towards the right faith. "Just as the characteristic of the right faith is its momentum, and that is understood by devotion and affection, or by being brought about." - Panchadhyayi by Maharshi Amritchandracharya. Because of the work, now, O Shri Jin Mukh Vanajinar! The strong reason for my success, I have known the proof...Jinar!" - Shri Devchandraji. "Without the right faith, there is no escape from suffering." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. Thus, due to the power of the Veda-sanvedya-pad, there is attainment of momentum in the above three meanings. Therefore, this Samyak-darshan, the liberated soul, runs away from the world with extreme momentum, with extreme speed, runs towards liberation with extreme momentum, and worships the instruments of liberation like Jin-bhakti with extreme momentum, with supreme enthusiasm, with supreme devotion. And thus, because of the attainment of the Veda-sanvedya-pad, and because of the excess of momentum, the above-mentioned activities like the destruction of the body, which may be there, are only the last, the final ones. Now, in the future, it is not possible for such sinful activities to happen again. This sinful activity is said to be the last because after that, this Samyak-darshan man will never again be able to move towards the bad path. Here, the example of Shriman Shrenik Raja is well-known. This great soul, the great being, attained the right faith, even though he was subject to destruction and rebirth, but due to the influence of past karma, he had his last sinful activity. He was able to understand the vows, the knowledge of the vows, etc., he was a Samyak-darshan with no interruption, and although he attained hell due to the influence of the karma of life that was bound before the right faith, it is only the last. After that, he will become the Tirthankara named Mahapadma in the next twenty. This is the extraordinary glory of the Veda-sanvedya-pad, the Samyak-darshan, which is the self-awareness. The supreme sage Shrimad Rajchandraji has sung: "There are no vows, no knowledge of vows, no renunciation of anything; he will become the Tirthankara Mahapadma, look at Shrenik's place. The Jinar says, 'Knowledge is his, let everyone hear it.'"

**Deepradrusti:** This statement, that **Kshayika Samyagjnandristi** is the only **Nishchay Veghavedya Pad** (279), is not meant to praise **Aviratipana**, but rather to highlight the unparalleled glory of **Samyagdarshan**, the knowledge of the self, the experience of the soul, even though there may be external **Avirati**. Moreover, true **Samyagdarshan**, as seen with feeling, is an unparalleled glory for the **Samyagdristi** person, who has attained **Viram-Virati** from the external world through the inner self. Otherwise, **Samyagdarshan** combined with external **Virati** is like mixing fragrance into gold. But knowledge without **Samyagdarshan** is like not knowing at all; it is like a large, empty vessel. Similarly, **Charitra-Virati-Vratapacchakhana** without **Samyagdarshan** is also like a large, empty vessel, useless for attaining **Moksha**, as stated in the **Shri Bhagavati Sutra**. 

This is what **Shrimad Rajchandraji**, in his profound and secret words, says in the same place, expressing this feeling: "He who has learned before, but does not know the soul, is ignorant, as the scriptures testify. All that has been said before, the soul must make pure. The Jina says, this is knowledge, let all the noble ones listen. Knowledge is not found in scriptures, nor in the cleverness of poets, nor in mantras and tantras, nor in language. Knowledge is not found in other places, knowledge is an art in the knower. The Jina says, this is knowledge, let all the noble ones listen. The soul and this body are not separate, until this is understood, the meaning of liberation is not spoken. The fifth limb of the teaching is pure, the Jina says, this is knowledge, let all the noble ones listen. Even those who have learned about the scriptures, but do not know their own form, let them take refuge in me with feeling. This is the knowledge that is spoken of, which is found in the place of agreement, etc. The Jina says, this is knowledge, let all the noble ones listen." 

**Shrimad Rajchandraji** says that **Samyagdarshan**, which is inseparable from the experience of the soul, that is, which has the experience of the soul with certainty, has this supreme effect. Therefore, once it is attained, it never leads to **Durgati** again. Some may doubt this, saying that there are countless beings in the world who have received **Samyagdarshan**, but have fallen back, and who often experience **Durgati**. How is this possible? 

Page #346:
---------------------------
(280) The resolution of the doubt regarding *Gidashtti Samuchaya* is that the one who doubts does not understand the meaning of the opinion and intention, because only the *Kshayik Samyagdashtti* has the definite *Vedhasanvedya Pad*, and this statement is made with reference to it. Here, the discussion is not about the practical *Vedhasanvedya Pad* that he believes in, or the practical definite *Vedhasanvedya Pad* or *Samyagdarshan*. This practical *Samyagdarshan* is not a beautiful *Sanvedya Pad*, because it does not end the cycle of birth and death. The cycle of birth and death ends only after attaining the definite *Vedhasanvedya Pad*. Therefore, this definite *Vedhasanvedya Pad* is the only beautiful, noble, good, selfless, truly true, and auspicious one. It is the only one that leads to the highest liberation. And once it is attained, one does not have to go to hell again, but only occasionally, due to the force of karma, one may have to go there once at the end (like the great soul, the great sage, Shrenik Maharaj). Even then, in hell, such a *Kshayik Samyagdashtti* person does not experience mental suffering. Just as unripe fruit does not ripen, so too, his emotions do not ripen due to the heat of mental suffering. His emotions do not burn, and he does not experience any pain. He remains balanced in his own nature, experiencing all happiness and sorrow with equanimity. "Whether a person is wise or ignorant, he cannot be without happiness and sorrow; the wise person experiences it from the heart, the ignorant person experiences it from the mind." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. Because he, the saint, who is an experiencer of the soul, knows, experiences, and feels with the soul's emotion, that - "Abadhu! Kya tera? Kya mera? Tera hai so teri pase, avar sab andera....Abadhu." I am the one, the pure, the *darshan-jnanamaya*, the eternally formless soul. Nothing else, not even an atom, is mine. I am the pure soul, the *Abaddhaprushta*, the unique, the definite, the indivisible, and the uncombined. "I am experiencing myself here as one who is completely dependent on the self, with a feeling of self-love. I have no attachment, no desire. I am the pure *chighan*, the treasure of light." "Ahamiko khlu suddo dasananaanamayo sadaruvi / navi asthi majjha kinchhivi annam paramanuminrtpi / / jo passadi appaanam abaddhaputthamannanyam niyadam / visamsangutta tan sudhanache viyali - Shri Samyatsar.

## Deepradrushti:

The Vedya-Samvedya Pad - "This is the Yogi" (281) - Being completely self-reliant, the law of sand, "I am not mine, I am not mine, I am not mine, I am pure, I am the treasure of virtues" - Samyasaar Kalash. "Do not give up the Parayaashti, it is one single, unbroken gold. Drink the Nirvikalpa Rasa, it is pure, Nir-anjan, one" - Anandghanaji. And so on, through such contemplation, this presented, supreme, virtuous soul, the determined, Samyagdrushti Jiva, never experiences any kind of anxiety, always remains in a state of detachment, constantly immersed in the bliss of the soul. But this determined Vedya-Samvedya Pad, other than this, is ugly in itself, it is not good, it is not beautiful. Because, as mentioned above, it does not stop the wandering of Bhava-Bhraman, the cycle of Samsara continues. Yes, punya-bandh happens, but Bhava-Vicched does not happen, therefore, one should constantly keep in mind the supreme, beautiful, determined Vedya-Samvedya Pad, to achieve it.

**Avedya-Samvedya Padam A-Padam Param-Arthatah / Padam Tu Vedya-Samvedya Padam Eva Hi Yoginaam // 72 //**

It is A-Pad from the perspective of Param-Arth, it is A-Ghasave; the determined Pad of the Yogis, it is the Vedya-Samvedya Pad, 72.

**Meaning:** Avedya-Samvedya Pad is A-Pad from the perspective of Param-Arth. The determined Pad of the Yogis is the Vedya-Samvedya Pad.

**Explanation:** The A-Samvedya Pad, which was mentioned above as ugly in itself, not good, not beautiful, why is it so, it is explained here. The A-Samvedya Pad, which is from the perspective of Param-Arth, is the Mithyaadi Aashya-Sthan. That is why it is said that it is A-Pad from the perspective of Param-Arth. From the perspective of the true nature of things, it is A-Pad due to ignorance. The true good is the Vedya-Samvedya Pad, which is described as the characteristic, through the unique Yoga (the true meaning of the word, according to the Shakha, is the same "Pad"), the determined Pad of the Yogis. 

Page #348:
---------------------------
(282) Considering the collection of yogaduktis as "apada" is simply that, it does not diminish its name as "pada". It is a mithyadristi-based ashayasthan, which is why it is not a place to put the "pada" (foot) for someone with samyagdristi. There is no place for it. As Shriman Anandghanji said, "There is a state where the foot cannot find a place to stand." But the true "pada" for the sick, the place to put the foot, is the vedyasamvedya pada. Because it is the "pada" that is truly "par" according to the true meaning of the word "pada", and it is only this that deserves the name "pada". The asamvedya pada or the vyavaharik vedyasamvedya pada is not stable, it is unstable, it is prone to fall, and it cannot end the cycle of birth and death. But if it becomes the cause of the nischya vedyasamvedya pada through tradition, that is, through the ability gained through its desire, the nischya vedyasamvedya yogijan pada that the jiva attains through this ability, only then and only then does the jiva end the cycle of birth and death and attain moksha. This nischya vedyasamvedya pada is not unstable, it is stable, it is not prone to fall, and therefore it quickly stops the cycle of birth and death and leads to liberation. Thus, the nischya vedyasamvedya pada immediately brings about moksha, which is why the yogijan always desires this nischya vedyasamvedya pada, considers it the ultimate goal from the perspective of truth, and knowing all other padas as apada, considers this nischya vedyasamvedya pada as the ultimate pada, and worships and adores it. And in this way it is said: वेद्यं संवेद्यते यस्मिन्नपायादिनिबन्धनम्  /  तथाप्रवृत्तिबुद्धयापि स्व्याद्यागमविशुद्धया  // 73 //  Meaning: Vedya, vedaniya, something that is to be experienced. It is something that is graspable through unconditioned knowledge from the state of being and the general feeling of the type. Samve - samvedaya is, the certainty is also known from the destruction of the pacification, parim - in which, in which pada - ashayasthan, what is it special? For that it is said avasanidhan - apaya adi's nibandhan - cause, the cause of hell - heaven etc., chari - adi, tatha - in such a way that it is penetrated by the general (connected with the general) agravrittivrishi - apravrittibuddhi. That is, through the buddhi of its upadan - tyaga ashayamka, through the buddhi of its upadan - tyaga (acceptance - rejection) ashay, now - samvedaya is, (woman etc. vedya) samvisuddha - agam from the pure. That is, from the shrat, the buddhi that makes the viparyayamal a rule. It is this that is the main binding cause for the spectator to think, which is why the woman etc. was accepted.

##  **Dimadrusti: Definition of Vedya Pada, Nari Nida (283)**

**The definition of Vedya Pada is given in Nari Nida (283) where the initial cause of Nida is explained, and the woman, etc., are considered Vedya.**

**The definition is as follows:**

**73. Meaning:**  Where the woman, etc., are Vedya - the object of medicine, pure according to the scriptures, and the mind is free from attachment, even then, it is perceived. (The connection to this verse is in the following verse.)

**Analysis:** The woman, etc., are Vedya, the cause of Nida, which is the cause of hell, heaven, etc., and is pure according to the scriptures. Even with a mind free from attachment, it is perceived - it is experienced correctly. This is called Vedya-Samvedya Pada, as explained in the following verse.

**Explanation:** Vedya means that which is worthy of being known, worthy of medicine, worthy of experience. It is the object of knowledge, which is grasped without any conceptualization, through the knowledge of the state of the object and the general nature of the object. The vision of the object, where the woman, etc., are experienced, is called Vedya.

**Here, Vedya refers to the object, such as the woman, etc., which is perceived, and which is caused by hell, heaven, etc.**

**The woman, etc., are Vedya objects, and their true nature, as it is, is experienced in a general way, according to the state of the object. This is Vedya.**

**Where the woman, etc., are Vedya - the object of experience, are perceived with a firm mind, according to their own decay and cessation, and are experienced correctly, as they are, this is called Vedya-Samvedya Pada, as explained in the following verse.**

**In other words, the true nature of the woman, etc., which is the cause of hell, etc., is perceived with a firm mind, which does not change in the three times. This perception, vision, and experience is Vedya-Samvedya Pada.**

**This firm mind is purified by the scriptures. Its impurities, such as the impurities of doubt and delusion, are washed away by the pure water of the scriptures.**

**This firm mind is free from attachment towards the woman, etc., and the nature of the object. This freedom from attachment is purified by the scriptures. In other words, after attaining the knowledge of Vedya-Samvedya Pada, this freedom from attachment becomes firm in the mind, and the woman, etc., are considered to be objects of renunciation, abandonment, and non-acceptance.**

**Due to this firm conviction, the correct...** 

Page #350:
---------------------------
(284) Even though a man with **Gadarisamuccaya** vision may not be able to completely renounce it from the beginning, he will always have the inner conviction of non-action towards the object of desire, such as women, and will never act towards it with attachment. Because, "The man who desires worldly pleasures with clear attachment has not heard the words of the **Jnanis**, or has not seen a **Jnanis**, says the **Tirthankara**. You know that the passion that arises upon seeing a woman after seeing a **Jnanis** is as if you have not seen a **Jnanis**. After hearing the words of a **Jnanis**, the living body of a woman will not remain without being affected by the **Jiva** for a moment. Indeed, the earth will not remain without being affected by the **Vikara** of wealth and other possessions. Except for the **Jnanis**, there is no other place for the **Atma** to reside for a moment." (For more details, see) Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 371. (454) Here, the main point about women is mentioned, and the reason is that even the most thoughtful beings are hindered by women. Even the **Durbhayy** **Kamachandala** **Pandits** are affected. "The worldly traveler, bound by the great snare of women, falls into the great dark well called **Bhava**." Therefore, by avoiding the main obstacle of women, there is a chance that other obstacles will also be easily broken. * "All of this world is the heroine, the renunciant is the hero; everything is renunciation, only sorrow is the form. By conquering one object, all the world is conquered; by conquering the king, the army and the kingdom are conquered." - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Moksha Mala. The greatest cause of **Apay** and **Atmahani** in this world, the greatest obstacle to **Kalyana**, is women. That is why the **Jnanis** have not spared any criticism of women. **Nari Ninda**, which is like nectar in speech and poison in the heart, is a natural evil, and we do not know who created this woman! * "The low-born, the worshiper of the **Jambavali**, beware of the **Naalamara** **Astras** - Shri Adhyatmasar, "अङ्गनादिमहापाशैरतिगाढं नियंत्रिताः  /  पतत्यंधमहाकूपे भवाख्ये भविनोऽध्वगाः  // " - Shri Shubhachandracharyaji's Shri Jnanarnava, *"धारयन्त्यमृतं वाचि हृदि हालाहलं विषम्  /  निसर्गकुटिला नार्यो न विद्मः केन निर्मिताः॥ वनज्वलनलेखेव भोगिदंष्ट्रेव केवलम्  /  वनितेयं मनुष्याणां संतापभयदायिनी।"

Page #351:
---------------------------
The knowledge of the fundamental nature of the object of discrimination, like the light of a lamp, is like the fangs of a snake, causing only suffering and fear to the human being. This woman, who dwells in the minds of even the saints, drives away the virtues that are worthy of worship in the world - she exiles them. It is better to embrace a furious, writhing serpent than to embrace a woman who is like a path to hell, even out of curiosity. A woman who provokes the senses of a man creates a fire in his heart that is not like the flame of a fire that is touched. A woman is like twilight, fleeting in her desires, like a low-lying river, she is fond of the low, and like the moon in its waning phase, she is crooked. And so, just as the nature of a woman is perceived with utter contempt, so too is the nature of all other things perceived in their true form by the man of right perception. Therefore, he knows clearly the distinction between what is to be rejected and what is to be accepted. This thing is worthy of rejection, and this thing is worthy of acceptance, this clear discrimination, determination, decisive intellect, and perception are firmly imprinted in his soul. Therefore, even if he may not be able to act accordingly, that is, even if he cannot renounce a woman, who is inherently to be rejected, or even if he cannot accept renunciation, which is inherently to be accepted, even then, his inner feeling, perception, realization, and unwavering conviction remain unchanged. Perhaps due to the force of karma, he may be unable to do so, but even then, he constantly feels a genuine remorse, thinking, "Alas! I cannot renounce this thing that is to be rejected, I cannot accept this renunciation." Thus, there is a distinction in the mind of the knower, while the ignorant do not have such a distinction in their perception. Thus, there is a vast difference between the vision, the tendencies, and the activities of the knower and the ignorant. Because the knower of right perception has attained the knowledge of discrimination. He knows the distinction between himself and other things. He has the unwavering perception and experience of the fundamental knowledge that "I am the pure soul, distinct from all other substances."

---------------------------
This common (common) self-awareness is a collection of perceptions. That is, all beings have a common perception of the knowable object that is graspable through non-conceptual knowledge (through vision), and they perceive this knowable object with certainty according to their own capacity. But the right perception-faith-self-awareness-experience-understanding of the common perception that has occurred is common to all. That is, whatever being there is, it has this right perception-like knowable-perceivable state, and whatever has this right perception-like knowable-perceivable state, it is the same being. The right perception being is the same being. From the above, the ultimate meaning emerges that even if there is the most subtle knowledge with self-awareness, which is the root of the bondage seed, there is a knowable-perceivable state. But without that seed-like knowledge, without self-awareness, even the most excellent knowledge of any other root object is not a knowable-perceivable state. It is for that seed-like knowledge that the knowledge of the essential element, which is the root seed-like knowledge of the self-other distinction, was there, but any other knowledge that was there, even the very subtle capacity like "Tushmaash" has passed away; and the fourteen previous ones who knew something less, the very great capacity scholars have also wandered, the reason for this is that seed-like perception knowledge. They knew all the scriptures, but the root seed-like knowable-perceivable state did not remain, they did not make this clear self-awareness-like determination of this being and this body, so it happened. Thus, in the absence of the knowable-perceivable state, where the root seed-like knowledge is essential, even the most subtle knowledge quickly becomes a great benefactor, and in its absence, even the most excellent knowledge does not become such a benefactor. This knowable-perceivable state shows the extraordinary glory of right perception. Shrimad Rajchandraji has revealed the extraordinary miraculous mysterious solution in this regard - another question. How is it that the knowledge of the fourteen previous ones who knew something less, in the infinite number of births, and even those with the most subtle knowledge, go to liberation in the fifteenth birth? - I will tell you the answer that is in my heart, that subtle knowledge is different and that occasion is also different. Subtle knowledge means, in general, knowledge of the root object, even in a very concise way, it is the seed of liberation. That is why it is said. And the knowledge of the fourteen previous ones, which is less in one country, has become aware of everything except the knowledge of one root object; but it did not become aware of the eternal object residing in the body-temple. And after that, it did not happen, just like the arrow shot without aim is not the reason for the hunter, this also happened. If the object that the knowledge of the fourteen previous ones has pierced to obtain is not obtained, then the knowledge of the fourteen previous ones has become ignorance. Here, the knowledge of the fourteen previous ones, which is less in the country, should be understood. By saying less in the country, 

Page #353:
---------------------------
**Dimadrusti:** The truly real, the essence of the self, is the same as the knowable (vedya) (287). Our ordinary mind might think that we have reached the end of the fourteen purvas, but something like a study or something else is left behind, and therefore we are wandering. But that is not the case. It is not reasonable to believe that a student of so much knowledge would be defeated in the study for a small part. That is, no language is difficult, or the meaning is not difficult, or it is rare for them to be remembered. Only the lack of knowledge of the original thing, that is the deficiency, it has failed the rest of the knowledge of the fourteen purvas. From one perspective, it can also be thought that: there is no difference in picking up the scriptures (written pages) and studying them, which is the principle that has not been found. Because both are the same. Picking up the pages, he has lifted the burden on the body, studying them, he has lifted the burden on me, but without the real purpose, it is understood that it will be useless. The one who has the whole salt sea in his house is not able to quench the thirst of the thirsty; but the one who has a well of sweet water in his house is able to quench the thirst of his father and some others. And in terms of knowledge, that is what is important. But now we have to look at another perspective. And that is that no matter how much study there is, there will be a desire to become worthy, and in time, one will become worthy, and one will also give worthiness to others. So, the purpose here is not to prohibit the study of scriptures. But we do not call it isolationism if we prohibit the study of scriptures that leads away from the original thing.”  etc. - (See) Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 125. (139) 

That which is different from the scriptures, etc., due to the correct position, is the characteristic of the word. In the scriptures, the knowable and the knower are said to be in accordance with the meaning. 74 Meaning - That word, which has the characteristic of being different from the scriptures, etc., due to the correct position, is called "vedya-sanvedya" in the scriptures, according to the true meaning of the word. As mentioned in the above discussion, where the woman, etc., is knowable, as it is, the knowing faculty - the mind - becomes a word through the word, that is, the place of intention, due to the correct position of the story of the ocean, due to the section, due to the correct position, due to the correct position. The friend, the enemy, the bone, etc., are different from the scriptures, etc., the characteristic of the word, the different scriptures - the country, the renunciation.

(288) The collection of right views is the experience of the soul, and this state is known in the scriptures as the "Vedya-Sanvedya-Pad". Because it is situated, positioned, and stable in the right way, it is rightly called the "Vedya-Sanvedya-Pad", because "Pad" means the place where one can place one's foot; and if it is stable, not shaky, then one can place one's foot there, one's foot will not be placed there. One cannot place one's foot there. But here, there is such stability from the feeling, so this "Pad" is called "Vedya-Sanvedya-Pad", it is rightly called in the true meaning of the word, it is so in reality. Because this Vedya-Sanvedya-Pad is primarily the self-awareness, the experience of the soul. And this soul-Pad is the real Pad, all others are not Pads, because what is the inherent nature of the soul, the inherent nature of the soul, is stable in all three times, the nature of the soul is the inherent birth-nature of the Pad - the pure nature of the soul, the realization of which, the experience of which, the feeling of which, is also stable in all three times, not changing, so it is called "Pad". Apart from this, all other so-called Pads, which are beyond the nature of the soul, are not Pads, but are not-Pads, because they are not of the nature of the soul, they are unstable, they are impermanent. So, leaving aside these unstable material-feeling not-Pads, the man of definite right view accepts this one, definite, stable, feeling (Pad) obtained from the nature. "आदम्हि दव्वभावे अपदे मोत्तूण गिण्ह तह णियदं। थिरमेगमिमं भावं उवलभंतं सहावेण  // " . –Shri Samayasar, verse 203 Because * in this Lord Soul, among many material-feelings, those which are obtained from the non-nature, experienced, having the state of impermanence, many, momentary, such changing feelings, all of them are not-Pads because of their impermanence, they are incapable of being the place of the one who stands. And that which is obtained from the nature - the nature of the soul, the not-Pad, many, becoming-experienced, having the state of permanence, one, eternal, that Pad is the only unchanging feeling, - it is the only one, because of its own permanence, it is capable of being the place of the one who stands. " इह खलु भगवत्यात्मनि बहूनां द्रव्यभावानां मध्ये ये किल अतत्स्वभावेनोपलभ्यमानाः, अनियतत्वावस्थाः, अनेके, क्षणिकाः, व्यभिचारिणो भावाः ते सर्वेऽपि स्वयमस्थायित्वेन स्थातुः स्थान भवितुमशक्यत्वात अपदभूताः। यस्तु तत्स्वभावेनोपलभ्यमानः, नियतत्वावत्थः, एकः, नित्यः, अव्यभिचारी भावः, स एक एव स्वयं स्थायित्वेन स्थातुः स्थानं भवितुं शक्यत्वात् पदभूतः  /  ततः सर्वानेवास्थायिभावान् मुक्त्वा स्थायिभावभूतं, परमार्थरसतया स्वदमानं ज्ञानमेकमेवेदं स्वाय  /  / " –Shri Amritchandracharya's Samayasatika, verse 203

##  Diimadrushti: The Essence of the Self

Diimadrushti: Since the form of the Self is capable of becoming the place of the glory-right perception (289), it is a true form. Therefore, leaving all temporary states behind, the permanent state, the essence of the Self, becomes the taste of the ultimate bliss. This knowledge is a single taste, a single experience. 

The meaning is that the knower, the Self, is the permanent, the stable, the only place where stability can exist. Therefore, it is the true essence of the Self. All other states, except the Self, are temporary, unstable, and fleeting. Therefore, they are not true forms. 

This Self, the ultimate form, is directly experienced by the self-knowing right perception. Since it is in the stable form, calling this experienced form "the form" is completely true. 

This pure, innate form of the Self is praised by the self-knowing men of ultimate right perception. They glorify this form. For example, "Without understanding this form, there is endless suffering from sin. This form is worthy of praise, O Guru. The yogi desires endless happiness, the pure Self, the essence of the Jina." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. 

"The lotus feet of the Jina are pure and stable. The lotus feet of the impure are temporary. The pure Jina is seen by the pure. My mind is filled with the lotus feet of the Jina. The bees collect the nectar of virtues. The mountains are filled with the fragrance of the Jina. The moon, the sun, and the serpent king are filled with the beauty of the Jina. There is no comparison to the Jina. The Jina is the ultimate peace. The Jina is the ultimate purity." - Giraj Anandghanji. 

"The service of the Jina, Shri Chandraprabha, is like the wind that blows through the trees. The experience of the Self is obtained through the virtues of the Jina. This experience protects us from fear." - Tatvarangi Muni Shri Devchandraji. 

Thus, this self-knowing, self-experiencing form is a true form, and it is indicated by the characteristics of karma-cutting, detachment from the world, etc. 

"This karma-bond, which is extremely painful and as strong as a mountain, is difficult to break."

(290) When the collection of yogic insights is separated from the sharp emotions, this right insight produces immense, essential joy for the great soul – just as the application of medicine removes the disease and produces joy. (Gabi) A country-renunciation-right-insight, whose root is the emotion of country-renunciation, the emotion of all-renunciation, etc., is also a characteristic of this Veda-perceptible state, because after the true understanding of the nature of things, the being naturally, by itself, gradually renounces the emotion of country-renunciation – the emotion of others – and leans towards the natural transformation – the wandering, etc., ceases. After the vision of the pure, innate self-nature, or the Jina-nature, filled with the essence of samadhi, after the awareness of the self-nature, forgotten since beginningless time, the being inevitably renounces, diminishes, and reverses all conceptual attachments and emotions, and progresses towards the practice of pure self-existence. And thus, descending from the earth of the great night of beginningless time, and remembering the pure, unbroken, unattached self-nature, the being cherishes the pure, holy, sharp, and pure contemplation, which is the essence of the truth, and embraces the Jina-mudra, the abode of equanimity, the pure self-nature of right insight. Through the attainment of the Jina-vision, etc., the pure, excellent lineage of the feet, the true understanding of the self-nature through the similarity of things, produces a respectful interest, and then that interest is followed by the effort – the self-power – that progresses and harmonizes with the unbroken tradition of the “lineage of the feet” – the self-conduct. In this, country-renunciation, all-renunciation, etc., are included in the emotion. The great truth-seer, Shriman Devchandraji, exclaimed with utmost emotional fervor upon experiencing the direct Jina-vision: “I have seen the facility, the renunciation, filled with the essence of samadhi… O red, shining self-nature, forgotten since beginningless time… the mind has renounced all conceptual attachments… the path of self-existence… I have seen… the earth of the great night of beginningless time, descending from the beginningless time… the pure, unbroken, unattached nature is remembered… the contemplation of the essence of truth, which is cherished… the Jina-mudra, the abode of equanimity, is embraced… I have seen… the roots, the limbs, the six-fold entourage, the many virtues…”.  - Shri Kundakunda Acharya’s Shri Ashtaprabhruta, etc.

**Dimādasti:** Ignorance-shaped, aghasava, bhavahbinandi (291) the Lord's mudra, the yoga Lord, the Lord's sovereignty, write...ho lal. The substance, its samya, its own wealth, it recognizes, recognizing, respect along with interest increases..., interest, the follower, the age, the charanadhara, sadha...ho lalditho”—Shri Devchandraji. Thus, when the awareness of the self-form arises, the influence of others' activities decreases, and the activity of one's own nature increases, therefore, women, etc., all the influence of others is considered undesirable, they begin to renounce it, and only pure self-feeling is desirable-acceptable, such a firm, unwavering conviction-like viveka arises in the self-knowing soul. Therefore, truly, from the heart, this life's deshathaya is avoided, para-virati, sarvavirati, etc., results are definitely produced. And this "grahanuta" is the most secret, main key (Master-Key) of all, that when the soul becomes the receiver, the reception of the other automatically disappears, when you become united with it, the other's fortune automatically disappears. When the self becomes the receiver, the reception of the other disappears, when the principle becomes united, the other's fortune disappears. Dharma" Shri Devchandraji. From the above, the meaning is that the kshayika samyagdasti is the same as the conviction, vedhasanvedya pada, it is the true samkiti, the ultimate samyagdarshan. Without the attainment of that "pada," only with vyavahar samyagdarshan, those who believe in the real samkiti of the father are playing in delusion, and they stop from making spiritual progress due to such delusion. But those who are not satisfied with only vyavahar samyagdarshan, even with the help of the vyavahar samyagdarshan, who constantly keep in mind the achievable conviction samyagudarshan, who are eager for the tavik conviction vedhasanvedya pada, who do not jump without its attainment, they definitely continue to make spiritual progress. This is easily understood from the above. Rati re vadhisvara: - Avedhasanvedya pada, the right, others say from it - अवेद्यसंवेद्यपदं विपरीतमतो मतम्  /  भवाभिनन्दिविषयं समारोपसमाकुलम्  //  75  /  /  ' Krutti - Complete disaster - Aghasavedya pada is opposite, then from this, from this vevasandha pada, mat-mat is, is desired, is believed, it is of this type - "Aved" means avedaniya - and what can be known, from the state of affairs and from the general feeling of this type, even the knowledge-word is not easily graspable, it is not graspable, such and such. 

Page #358:

(292) The term "Aghasansvedya Pad" is the opposite of this, it is "Bhavaabhinandi Vishachi" and is also "Samaropa Samukul". 75, Meaning - The opposite of this is called "Asansvedya Pad". It is "Vishay Bhavaabhinandi" (Bhavaabhinandi is the state of the Jiva), and it is "Samakupa Samukul". Commentary - "This is the opposite, the Pad is Avedyasansvedya, Bhavaabhinandi Jiva, it is Avedya Mani" - Shri J.D. Sajjay. 4-8. The characteristic of the "Vedyasansvedya Pad" that was described earlier, the opposite of that is called "Avedyasansvedya Pad". The reason for this is as follows: "Avedya" means "Avedaniya" - not to be known, not to be experienced. According to the state of affairs and the type of Bhavagis, it is not possible to grasp it through non-conceptual knowledge. This is because there is no "Samaan Pariavedya" (similar experience) that arises in this case. That is why it is called "Avedya". What does this mean? Bhavagis generally have a certain type of general, similar feeling, experience, and right understanding of the state of affairs. Therefore, they have a similar result in the form of self-awareness, right understanding, and experience. For example, "There is a soul different from the body etc." - This type of knowledge of difference is generally experienced by all Bhavagis. This experience is non-conceptual, non-dualistic, and without any choice. This non-conceptual experience is the form of right understanding. Because "Darshan" is said to be non-conceptual, and knowledge is due to the lack of similar results. (Because such similar results do not occur). This "Avedya" is "Sandaya", which means that it is "Upakshavassarvipasarup" (confused) due to the destruction of the veil of ignorance, and it appears in the form of a mirage, like a mirage of water. That is why it is said - "Mavaaminavishachan" - "Bhavaabhinandi" which is "Vishachi" (poisonous), "Bhavaabhinandi" type of "Vishay" (object). Its characteristics will be described. (Bhavaabhinandi means one who praises, admires, and enjoys the world). "Samaropa Samukul" - extremely engrossed. It is also contaminated by "Samaropa" which is directed towards the "Gamanabhimukh" (towards the path) due to the "Mithyatva" (false belief) defect.

##  Diimadrusti: A Samare Paroop Aghasevdy Pad

(20)  is an alternative. But in "Adya", there is no such kind of emotionally comprehensible, common sensation-perception. That's why it is called "Adya".

Or, in another way, if we reduce it, the Bhavagios generally have different levels of self-awareness, which generally have some kind of common sensation, perception, and experience of something, according to the situation. But in this "Avedya", there is no such derivation of the result of common sensation of the level of Samyagdristi, it does not come in any such low category - it is not attained, that's why it is called "Adya".

Sandeya means something that is always there, is known, is experienced, and here, because of the presence of Mithyatva, knowledge is only ignorance. So, the veil of ignorance,

as much as it has moved, according to the Kshayopapsham, the ignorance in the form of Uppava, Viparyas, and confusion, the knowledge-wisdom that is ignorance here, which is Mithya sensation, is like a mirage. Mirage (water in the desert)

is false, Mithya, so this Adya sensation is also false, Mithya; because there is a Mithya illusion-delusion here, believing the false water of the mirage to be true. Param* Tatvikshekhara Shriman Amritchandracharya

Ignorance makes the deer run to drink the water of the mirage with water-wisdom, ignorance makes people run in the darkness with the illusion of a snake in the dust, and ignorance makes this (soul), even though it is pure knowledge, become agitated like the sea where waves rise from the wind, becoming the doer.

Where such a Mithya-like sensation of mirage occurs due to ignorance, that is the Avedya Sandeya Pad, and in reality, it is not even worthy of the name "Pad" as mentioned above. This Adya Sandeya Pad is found in the Bhavaabhinandi Jeeva. Bhavaabhinandi means one who welcomes-appreciates-praises the world, one who enjoys-is engrossed in the world, one who finds the world sweet (Hails), this is the characteristic of the subject-passion, the worm, the small insect, which will be explained later.

Furthermore, this Avedya-Svedya pad is characterized by samaropa, meaning there is an imposition, a superimposition, one thing is placed on top of another, one's cap is placed on another's head, one's own self is imposed on another, and another's is imposed on one's own self. Therefore, in the Avedya-Svedya pad, instead of being in their own state, the Bhava-abhinandi jiva considers another as their own, they attribute the soul to the body and other things, they climb on top of another's seat, they take over another's cushion! Although the soul itself is the very essence of happiness, it imposes that happiness on the pudgala-vishaya! And the flower of that samaropa's intensity is also enjoyed by them as intense suffering! Because this samaropa is caused by Mithyatva-dosha, it leads to the jiva going towards Apaya-gamanabhimukha - towards hell and other Apayas; therefore, it causes harm to the soul's true nature, and the attainment of hell and other Apayas leads to intense suffering.
Samaropa Samakula
This samaropa, this superimposition, is the subject of Vyavahar-naya. Therefore, the jiva who is in the Avedya-Svedya pad is predominantly Vyavahar-pradhaan. And the one whose vision remains in Vyavahar, they do not attain the true nature of Paramatma, they remain entangled in the endless complexities of Vyavahar, they keep spinning in circles, they do not attain the one, undivided, true nature; because their hand remains focused on Vyavahar, on superimposition, they do not receive anything in their hand; the one who focuses on Paramatma, they receive the true nature of things, just like the one in the Vedya-Svedya pad.
"There is one thread,
Its complexities are endless, the true nature of the Lord is not in anyone's hand;
By following the pure naya, there is no doubt left, the true nature." - Shri Anandghanji.
"The path of Paramartha, which flows, is written in Vyavahar,
This samaropa-filled Avedya-Vedya pad arises from Mithyatva-dosha. It is wrong, it is false, it is a false perception, and its subject is the Bhava-abhinandi jiva."
*
The characteristics of Bhava-abhinandi are described as follows:
क्षुद्रो लोभरतिर्दीना मत्सरी भयवान् शठः ।
अज्ञो भवाभिनन्दी स्याम्निष्फलारम्भसं गतः ॥ ७६ ॥
Vritti! - Nnu-ru: Dhruva, Krupana, Matti: Labha-rati, those who are delighted in gain, those who are greedy, Loali, Manchasheel (those who are begging in nature), Phon: Deen, always in a state of misfortune, Mani: Masarvat, those who are unhappy in the happiness of others.

Yoga-drushti-samuccaya
He wanders around begging! He runs after mirage to quench his thirst for worldly desires! But he overlooks the infinite power of the soul that resides within him!
The living being is a beggar in the city of existence, taking on the role of a beggar;
He begs for worldly pleasures, wandering day and night. - Manonadan (Dr. Bhagwandas)
He is a miserable being. He is always pessimistic, always seeing the negative side of things. He is like a poor, wretched beggar, always seeing the bad, the negative, the pessimistic. Alas! Will this worldly desire that resides in my body ever go away? Will anyone take it away? Will anyone snatch it away? Even towards a man like Indra, he always harbors suspicion. This poor fellow sees negativity and misfortune everywhere; he is always fearful, anxious, and constantly trembling; and he acts like a poor, helpless, wretched beggar, because he does not see the inherent nature of his own self, which is liberation from suffering.
Therefore, he is envious of others' virtues
Moreover, this living being, who is bound by the cycle of birth and death, is envious and hateful. He harbors hatred towards wealth. When he sees someone else's good fortune or someone else's virtues, he feels disturbed, he feels a desire, he feels unhappy. Because he considers worldly desires to be important, he is attached to them; and when he sees the happiness of others, such as worldly pleasures that he does not possess, or when he sees the noble and auspicious virtues of others, he feels envy in his mind, thinking, "They got it, and I was left behind." He is envious of virtue and good qualities.
He is fearful. He is always anxious. Fear of this world and the next, fear of pain, fear of helplessness, fear of insecurity, fear of death, etc., constantly torment him, frighten him. Alas! My possessions will be stolen! Alas! I will suffer! Alas! Death will come upon me! In this way, he is always trembling with fear; because he is not aware of his eternal self, which is the ultimate refuge.
He is deceitful
He is deceitful, meaning he is cunning and deceptive. He tries to deceive the world, to throw dust in the world's eyes. His mind, speech, and body are not in harmony. There is a discrepancy between his thoughts, his words, and his actions. Although he is wicked, he tries to appear virtuous, he pretends! His efforts are hypocritical.

The tradition of the Yogadristi Samuchaya continues because the power of raga, dvesha, etc. is strong in the bhava-abhinandi. Thus, whatever dharma-karan the bhava-abhinandi tries to do, it fails! - This bhava-abhinandi jiva, who is very attached to the world, enjoys the world, is engrossed in the world, is like a worm in the world. "Lebhi krupana dayamanaji, mayi machchar than; bhava-abhinandi bhay bhariyoji, afal aaramh ayan....man." - D. Sakzaya 4-9
What is true, so what? For this, it says - इत्यसत्परिणामानुविद्धो बोधो न सुंदरः । तत्संगादेव नियमाद्विपसंपृक्तकाम्नवत् ॥ ७७ ॥ Yukta asat parinamathi, badh ni sundar em; tas sangathi j niyamathi, visaspashta ann jem. 77
Meaning - Such asat parinamathi anuviddha (connected) bodha, from its association, by rule, is not beautiful - like food mixed with poison.
The characteristics of the bhava-abhinandi, which were shown above, are clarified here. Whatever results the bhava-abhinandi - the jiva who enjoys the world - has, are asat. Therefore, whatever knowledge he has, is also connected to the asat parinam. Just as a dove is trapped in a net, his bondage is also trapped in the asat parinam. Therefore, due to the association of the asat parinam, his bondage is also asat by rule, not beautiful, not good. Because, whatever association, that color is applied. Thus, due to the asat parinam, his knowledge is completely spoiled. Here, food mixed with poison, contaminated, mixed
Vritti: - Re - Such bhava-abhinandi parinam sat - due to this asat parinam, jarurinanuviddha - connected to the asat parinam, trapped, connected, associated, vo-bodha - general, not sundar - not beautiful. Why? Because - tarasav - due to its association, due to the relationship of the asat parinam, niyamanu - by rule, like what? Because vipdyattaranav - visaspashta ann jem, food mixed with poison. Such an example is only an illustration.

Until the self-realization is absent in the object, until the evil, wicked, and lustful desires towards the external and internal objects are not removed, until the soul's karma and tendencies are not satisfied in the external and internal objects, until then, all its knowledge is ignorance, and its infinite material actions are also futile and useless. "Material action is a means, a method, a request, which is read in the Jina Agamas; karma and tendencies are satisfied in the objects, then it becomes true, O mind, from the attachment." - Shri Devchandraji
This is what the fruit says -
"These people are indeed here, those who are attached to the wrong view. They are blind to the discrimination of good and bad, and they are distressed by the present." - 78
The meaning is that these people who are in the state of ignorance are attached to the wrong view, and they are blind to the discrimination of good and bad. They are only seeing the present, and they are distressed.
The commentary is that, because of the reason mentioned above, these people who are in the state of ignorance are attached to the wrong view. They see the non-existent as existent, and the existent as non-existent. They see the truth as untruth, and the untruth as truth.
They see the eternal as non-eternal, and the non-eternal as eternal. They see dharma as adharma, and adharma as dharma. They see good as bad, and bad as good. They see the undesirable as desirable, and the desirable as undesirable. They see knowledge as ignorance, and ignorance as knowledge. They see the soul as non-soul, and the non-soul as soul. And so on, in many ways, the wrong view, the inverted understanding, is revealed, the manifested feeling is seen. The meaning is that the wrong view is the belief that is contrary to the reality.
"These people who are in the state of ignorance, because of this reason, here, in this world, are attached to the wrong view. They are blind to the discrimination of good and bad, and they are distressed by the present." - 78
Therefore, it is said that those who are attached to the wrong view are distressed by the present.

##  Diimadrushti:  In a body of viparyasa, the soul's perception of itself is the cause of samsara.

(301)  The obstacle to the soul's attainment of the true nature of things is its innate viparyasa-bhava, a perception that, whether consciously or unconsciously, misinterprets the nature of things.  This viparyasa-bhava, which is not overcome by the teachings of vairagya and upashama, leads to a distorted understanding of the world.  As long as this viparyasa-bhava persists, even the contemplation of principles will be distorted.  The ego and attachment that arise from the desire for worldly possessions, family, and other things, and the passions of attachment and aversion that arise from the attainment or non-attainment of these things, are all manifestations of this viparyasa-bhava.

–Shrimad Rajchandra Patranka 418. (506)  This viparyasa-bhava, this distorted perception, makes the soul blind to the difference between what is beneficial and what is harmful.  It is unable to discern between the two, and so it engages in harmful activities, even though they bring suffering.

"Hitam hitva hite sthitva durdhir duhkhayase bhrisham. Viparyaye tayorehi tvam sukhayishyase sudhih."

–Shri Gunabhadra Swami's Shri Atmanushasana:  By abandoning the beneficial and dwelling in the harmful, the foolish soul experiences great suffering.  But by reversing this, by abandoning the harmful and dwelling in the beneficial, the wise soul will attain happiness.

The soul that cultivates the belief that happiness will not be found on the path that leads to happiness, will be hindered from pursuing the true path.  It will think, "I will not find happiness on this path, happiness will be found on another path," and thus it will be prevented from pursuing the true path.  It will encounter obstacles to the attainment of true happiness.  This kind of perception is what the wise call mithyatva.

–Shri Manahsukhbhai K.  Shantasudharas Vivechan.  Therefore, such a soul is only concerned with the present, only with the present moment.  It only sees the present and does not consider the past or the future.  It believes, "This life is sweet, what have I seen of the next life?" and only thinks about the present.  Thus, it forgets the past and the future, becoming attached to this life.  It believes that all its duties are to be performed in this life, and it becomes completely absorbed in its activities.  In this way, it loses awareness of what is beneficial and harmful, what is right and wrong, what is edible and inedible, what is drinkable and undrinkable.  It forgets the true nature of the soul, which is pure consciousness, distinct from the physical body.  It identifies itself with the body, and becomes oblivious to its true nature.  It becomes completely absorbed in the body and its needs. 

Page #368:

(302)
The collection of wrong views and the attachment to this perishable body, for which these poor souls endure so much suffering and toil, this attachment to the body becomes a bondage for them!
Because the body with which they have such a strong attachment, how can that body not also become a bond in return for the suffering it endures? Is it ungrateful? Is it grateful? Therefore, due to the self-consciousness in the body, they cannot detach themselves from the body; as long as they are bound, birth and death do not cease; as long as birth and death do not cease, suffering does not cease; and as long as this birth, death, and suffering do not cease, the cycle of samsara does not cease. Thus, for the sake of maintaining their relationship with this body, which they consider to be their own, these unfortunate souls, like oxen burdened with toil, continue to wander in the path of samsara, lamenting their fate! Shriman Pujyapaad Swami ji has said:
“In the body, the self-consciousness binds the soul to that body with certainty; and in the true self, the self-consciousness separates the soul from the body. Due to the self-consciousness in the body, the illusions of son, wife, etc., are born in the body. And due to those illusions, the soul, with its self-consciousness, considers the wealth of the father to be its own. Alas! This unfortunate world has been destroyed! The root of the suffering of samsara is the self-consciousness in the body. Therefore, by severing this self-consciousness in the body, and not allowing the senses to be active in the external world, one should enter within.” But the unfortunate souls have self-consciousness in the body. And due to this perverse and inverted consciousness, they become bound to the body and suffer the cycle of samsara. Thus, it is clear that from this perversion arises ignorance, from ignorance arises the wrong perception of the present, and from wrong perception arises the suffering of samsara.
जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिरोगशोकायुपद्रुतम् । वीक्षमाणा अपि भवं नोद्विजन्तेऽतिमोहतः ।। ७९ ।।
Commentary: - Birth, the manifestation of which is birth, death, the cessation of life, old age, the loss of youth, disease, illness, etc., suffering, intense pain caused by fear, grief, etc., due to the loss of loved ones, etc., and the word "aayupadruta" refers to the suffering caused by the elements, etc. Even seeing all this, they do not worry because of their extreme delusion.

## Dimāiṣṭi: The Great Delusion of Bhava

**The great delusion of Bhava, birth, death, and other sufferings, birth, death, disease, old age, pain, and sorrow; even seeing Bhava, one does not feel distress, due to extreme attachment.**

**Commentary:**

The text states that beings caught in the cycle of Bhava (existence) are deluded, with a distorted mind and intellect. They are unable to discern between what is beneficial and harmful, and are solely focused on worldly pleasures. This lack of discernment leads them to remain oblivious to the suffering inherent in the world, even when they witness it directly. They are so attached to worldly things that they do not feel any distress or desire to escape from this cycle of suffering.

**The text further elaborates on the nature of this suffering:**

* **Birth, old age, and death are the primary causes of suffering.** These are the inevitable realities of existence, and they are accompanied by a multitude of other pains, such as disease, sorrow, and frustration.
* **The root cause of this suffering is attachment.** Attachment to worldly things, such as pleasure, possessions, and relationships, leads to suffering because it creates a sense of dissatisfaction and insecurity.
* **The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is a constant source of suffering.** It is a never-ending cycle of pain and frustration, and it is only through liberation from this cycle that true happiness can be attained.

**The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the delusion of Bhava and seeking liberation from it.** This can be achieved through spiritual practices such as meditation, self-reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge.

**The text also quotes from the teachings of Shrimad Rajchandraji and Shri Gunabhadra Swami:**

* **Shrimad Rajchandraji:** "Birth, old age, and death are the main causes of suffering. The reason for this is attachment, aversion, and ignorance."
* **Shri Gunabhadra Swami:** "Just as a worm trapped in a piece of wood burning on both ends, so too is the soul trapped in the body, suffering from birth and death."

**The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the delusion of Bhava and seeking liberation from it.** This can be achieved through spiritual practices such as meditation, self-reflection, and the pursuit of knowledge.

“There is no time, no moment, that I can remember from within, where I have not been in this cycle of birth and death, and where I have not lost my samadhi, and where I have not remembered this, and where I have not been given great detachment.”
“Moreover, whose mouth has never said, ‘I will not take this,’ whom I will never take, why was I born in their house as a son, as a daughter, as a servant, as a maidservant, as a small one? That is, I was born in this form due to such hatred! And I did not want it! Tell me, when this is remembered, does this subtle soul not feel disgust? That is, it does.”
—Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 115 (128)
Moreover, when death comes, this soul experiences the same unbearable, intense pain. And the body in which it has lived its entire life, and the other attachments that are dependent on that body, when it is left behind, when it is abandoned, the soul experiences extreme internal-mental anguish. Every time it leaves a body, it has to experience this unbearable internal pain due to the impermanence of that body. And it does not want to take on that birth, but it is forced to. Therefore, its inner being is cut off. But all the possessions it considered its own remain there, they do not come with it.
“Moreover, death occurs, without which I cannot live for even a moment, and I leave behind so many things (wealth, etc.), and their separation has lasted for an infinite time; still, living without them is not so surprising. That is, when I had such feelings of attachment, they were imagined. Did such feelings of attachment ever exist? This again and again gives detachment.”
-Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 115,

##  The Suffering of the Soul

**Dimadrushti**, **jara**, **reg**, **shek**, and other forms of suffering - what is the fate of a human being? Like a fruit that falls from a palm tree, the soul, in the form of a **jantu**, falls from the **taadvrush** (birth) and reaches the **bhoomibhag** (death). How long will it remain in between? Just as a fruit that falls from a palm tree doesn't take long to reach the ground, the soul doesn't take long to reach death from birth. "What virtues can we sing of your worthless body? You built a palace but couldn't stay in it. You chew on leaves and seeds, but your mouth is filled with dirt." - Sant Kabirji

Thus, the cycle of birth and death continues. After birth comes death, and after death comes birth - an endless chain of **anubandh**. Due to this, the soul, trapped in the **arghattghati** (cycle of birth and death), wanders in the **sansar** (world) like a drop of water in a well, experiencing endless suffering. 

Here, we will also discuss the other major sufferings that the soul faces in each birth. 

When **jara** (old age) arrives, the soul's condition deteriorates. The five senses weaken, become **vikal** (disabled), and lose their strength. The body becomes unable to stand, and one has to rely on a stick for support. The waist bends, the body wrinkles, and **dukh** (pain) becomes a constant companion. One becomes dependent on others, endures their insults, and hears the bitter words, "He is neither dead nor alive." This old age is no less painful. 

Furthermore, in old age, the ears become deaf, as if unwilling to hear the scorn of others. The eyes become blind, as if unable to bear the sight of the father's helpless state. The body trembles in fear of the approaching **chamaraj** (death). Even in this dilapidated, flickering abode of **jara**, the soul remains **nishkap** (unaware). 

Shrimad Rajchandraji, in his **Meksha Mala**, beautifully describes this state: "The beard is wrinkled, the body is bent, the black hair is covered with dust. The senses of smell, hearing, and sight have faded. The teeth have fallen out or are about to fall out. "Your eyes are unable to see your condition, as if you have gone blind. Your body trembles in fear of the approaching end. What is your home in this world?" - Shri Atmaanushasan. 

Page #372:
---------------------------
(306).
"The collection of ailments, the bent back, the bones gone, the body's color faded, the ability to rise gone, the walking stick taken away; Oh, King Chandra! Even youth is lost, but the mind, even that, has lost its motherly affection."

Similarly, when chronic diseases like leprosy, etc., or acute ailments like cholera, etc., which cause intense pain, attack this body, when they forcefully shake this body and surround it from all sides, then this father's body becomes extremely unbearable, and sometimes the desire to leave it arises, such unbearable pain is experienced here. When these ailments appear, the desire to leave arises;
"You consider this body yours, but it is not yours." - Poet Shri Dalpatram.

And when separation from a beloved object or association with an undesirable thing occurs, the inner sorrow in the form of grief gives extreme anguish to the heart. One desires - "I did not get the desired object,
Oh, alas! I did not get this, this was attached to me, it went away leaving me empty-handed," such inner anguish arises.

Or, if a beloved person like a relative dies due to death, etc., then one grieves, saying, "Oh! He is gone, how will I live without him?" Or, if an undesirable event like illness, loss of wealth, or loss of honor occurs, then one also grieves, saying, "Oh! How will this undesirable event go away? When will I be relieved from this difficulty?" In this way, in this world, due to the separation from the beloved or the association with the undesirable, the inner sorrow arising from grief, like a worm, eats away the heart of the living being. This is the living word picture of all these:

The unbearable pain that arises from a young, delicate person being pierced by a needle all over his body, is eight times less than the pain that a living being experiences when it resides in the womb. For almost nine months,
in the state of fainting, immersed in feces, urine, saliva, pus, etc., it is born with a mixture of pain, sorrow, and happiness. At the time of birth, infinite times more pain and sorrow are produced than the pain of the womb. After that, childhood is reached. In the state of nakedness, with feces, urine,
dust, and without understanding, it cries and wanders around, and childhood is completed, and youth arrives. To earn wealth, one has to fall into minor sins, from which the tendency towards worldly desires arises. Madness, laziness, pride, contemptuous vision, association, separation, thus youth passes in a whirlwind.

## Deepradrushti: Confusion between right and wrong, finding happiness in suffering
(307)

Old age arrives. The body weakens, saliva drips from the mouth; wrinkles appear on the skin; the ability to smell, hear and see becomes weak, hair turns white and starts falling out; the ability to walk diminishes, one has to walk with a stick and stumble; or one has to lie on a bed for the rest of their life; breathing, coughing, etc. afflictions cling to the body, and soon death arrives and takes it all away. The soul departs from this body. The body was, it is not. Even at the time of death, there is so much pain! In the fourfold suffering, even in the best human body, there is so much pain! Yet, as mentioned above, time does not come in a fixed order. It can come at any time and take us away, therefore, wise men, without indulging in pleasures, worship self-welfare.” —Shrimad Rajchandraji-pranit Moksha Mala, Chapter 18.

This beautiful word-picture depicts the suffering of the world in a vivid and clear manner. And thus, even though the suffering of birth, death, etc. is clearly visible, why are these souls not disturbed by it? Why do they not flee from it with great speed...? Why? Why would they want to stay in a burning house? Such natural questions arise. The great author himself answers this: “Due to excessive attachment”, due to the overwhelming power of attachment, these greatly attached souls are not disturbed by the world, they do not feel disgusted, therefore, they do not want to escape from it and end it! On the contrary, they are confused by attachment and cling to it with strong attachment! They find pleasure in it! They drink the salty water of the ocean of the world with gusto, believing it to be sweet! And they make their name “Bhavahbindi” (bound by the cycle of birth and death) meaningful!!

## Example:

What does it say? It says:

“Kukrutyam krutyam abhati krutyam chaakrutyavat sada | Duhkhe sukhadhiyakrushta kachchookandukadivat ||80||”

Meaning:

“Tsy-kukrutyam, pranatipat-arambh adi kukrutyam, nrittyamamati-krutyam bhase chhe, mohanne lidhe, ruty-and krutyam, ahinsa-anarambh adi krutyam, styavat sarva-akrutyam jevu sada bhase chhe, mehthi j.

(Translation: “Tsy-wrongdoing, killing-beginning etc. wrongdoing, nrittyamamati-rightdoing appears, due to delusion, ruty-and rightdoing, non-violence-non-beginning etc. rightdoing, styavat sarva-wrongdoing like always appears, due to attachment.

## Deeprayashti: The Trap of Attachment and Suffering (309)

A pure soul finds peace and tranquility in the end. This is a direct experience for everyone. But due to the delusion (viparayas), this being has a distorted mind and therefore follows the wrong path. It desires happiness through Rs'isa (violence) and other means! Therefore, seeking happiness, it becomes miserable! And abandoning the path of happiness like ahi'sa (non-violence), it embraces the path of suffering like hi'sa (violence) and struggles to find happiness, but being corrupted by happiness, it experiences only suffering! This being needs to go north, but it takes the southern path! This being desires the nectar of happiness, but it drinks the poison of suffering!

Similarly, ar'bh (attachment) is the cause of manifest agitation, and nirar'bh (non-attachment) is the cause of manifest tranquility. The more ar'bh and upadhi (attachments), the more agitation and suffering; the more nirar'bh and nirupadhi (non-attachments), the more tranquility and happiness. This is a self-evident and undeniable truth. Yet, the being with a deluded mind acts contrary to this, and behaves in the opposite way. It believes that by engaging in ar'bh and samar'bh (attachment and accumulation), it will find happiness. Therefore, it engages in acts of hi'sa (violence), ar'bh (attachment), and papacharan (sinful conduct), accumulating sin and earning its karma. For example, it believes that wealth brings happiness, and therefore, it engages in various sinful businesses and ar'bh (attachments) to acquire wealth, regardless of the means. Such as: agnikarm (fire-related work), vanakarm (forest-related work), shaktam (labor), bhatakarm (trading), dantavanijya (ivory trade), lakhvanijya (lac trade), rasavanijya (perfume trade), keshvanijya (hair trade), vishavanijya (poison trade), etc.

Ar'bh (attachment) is the cause of suffering. It grabs from all sides, and as ar'bh (attachment) increases, so does its friend, parigrah (grasping). This so-called parigrah (grasping) also, as its name suggests, holds the being captive, binding it. Then, this 'grah' (planet, evil spirit, or crocodile) like parigrah (grasping) holds the being so tightly that even if it wants to escape, it becomes difficult. It clings and clings, making it difficult to remove. Those who engage in worldly business or those who hold worldly possessions like kingdoms, experience this. These unfortunate souls, trapped in the web of parigrah (grasping), cannot even sleep peacefully at night. Thus, the ar'bh upadhi (attachment) that the being has created with its own hands becomes a source of agitation and suffering for the being itself! What one does with one's hands, one suffers from! The buffalo's horns become a burden to the buffalo itself!

Parigrah (grasping) is the cause of suffering. Thus, being drawn by the delusion of happiness in suffering, this being engages in sinful acts like hi'sa (violence).

This concept is prevalent in the collection of Gadasthi and in the beginning-acceptance, but it is not prevalent in the virtuous acts of non-violence, etc., which are conducive to happiness, and in the non-beginning. Therefore, two well-known examples have been presented here - (1) If someone has scabies, they feel a sweet itch, so they scratch the scabies, but as a result, they get inflammation, and the wound burns. (2) If a person has worms, they believe that they will be removed by non-treatment - roasting, etc., but doing so increases the disease.
Why is it that a living being, tormented by countless physical and mental sufferings, despite wanting to get rid of those sufferings in many ways, cannot be freed from them? This question arises for many living beings, but its true solution is only attained by a few rare living beings. Until the root cause of suffering is truly known, no matter how much effort is made to avoid it, suffering cannot be destroyed. And no matter how much aversion, unpleasantness, and lack there is towards suffering, one has to experience it.
It is well known that all living beings are averse to suffering, unpleasant, and favorable to happiness and pleasant. All living beings strive to be free from suffering and to attain happiness. Despite the efforts of all living beings, it is evident that they experience suffering. Sometimes, some living beings seem to attain some portion of happiness, but due to the abundance of suffering, it is seen. "Etc. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter No. 694 (755)
Thus, due to the inversion, there is no awareness of the true nature of happiness and suffering, and therefore, the living being who is attached to the cycle of birth and death has an inverted activity. There is wrong conduct. Explaining the same meaning, it is said -
Just as those who scratch, their minds are on removing the scabies.
So also, in the case of these beings, there is no examination of their desires in the objects of enjoyment. || 81 ||
Explanation - There was a patient who scratched scabies. Due to excessive scratching, his nails were worn out. Then, due to living in sandy land, he could not find a piece of wood to scratch with. He saw a Vaidya (physician) traveler who had taken grass and straw with him, along with his begging bowl, etc. He asked him for a piece of grass, and he gave it to him. So he was very satisfied and started to think - Oh! This is truly blessed! Who has so many tools for scratching? Then he asked him - Friend, where do you get all these? He said - In the Lat country, etc. What is its use? He said - To remove the itch of scabies (by scratching). The traveler - If that is the case, what is the use of this? I will remove your scabies in seven nights. You take Triphala and... 

Page #377:
---------------------------
**Dimadrusti:** Just as those who scratch an itch are focused on the means of scratching, but not on eliminating the itch itself,
(311) so too, the mind of these bhavagamini beings is focused on the objects of desire, but not on the elimination of desire for those objects.

**Meaning:** Just as the minds of those who scratch an itch are focused on the act of scratching, but not on eliminating the itch itself, so too, the minds of these bhavagamini beings are focused on the objects of desire, but not on eliminating the desire for those objects.

**Commentary:** The beautiful analogy presented here (see Vritti) is worth pondering, and its underlying message is worthy of acceptance.

A person suffering from an itch finds the scratching very pleasurable, and therefore derives so much joy from scratching that even if their nails wear down from scratching, the itch doesn't go away! They then seek out other means of scratching, such as grass or other objects. Now, if a wise physician comes along and tells them, "Brother, I will completely eliminate this itch for you. Let me use Triphala," then the person will say, "This itch is better than no itch at all. It feels good to me, so do whatever it takes to make me scratch." Although this scratching provides temporary pleasure, it ultimately leads to inflammation, the itch worsens, and the disease takes root deeper. But just like a foolish animal, these ignorant beings don't understand this.

Similarly, the bhavagamini beings are afflicted with the great disease of samsara, which is like an itch. They experience the sweet itch of desire for worldly objects, and they try to eliminate this itch by indulging in those objects, but no matter how much they indulge, the itch doesn't go away. It only intensifies, like a fire that is fed with fuel. The inflammation of suffering arises, and the disease of samsara takes root deeper. Instead of finding satisfaction in worldly objects, they only become more attached to them.

It has been said, "If the itch is gone, what is the benefit of living without it?" Therefore, they cling to Triphala! Just tell them where to find it!

They are so engrossed in their desires that they don't even think about eliminating them. Their minds are focused on the means of satisfying their desires, but not on the elimination of those desires. Just as the mind of someone scratching an itch is focused on the means of scratching, but not on eliminating the itch itself, so too, the minds of these bhavagamini beings are focused on the objects of desire, but not on the elimination of desire for those objects. Their ignorance and lack of maturity, coupled with their attachment to worldly pleasures, keep them trapped in this cycle.

Here, the word "chuch" refers to the act of grasping, which is a characteristic of the cycle of birth and death.

We count the collection of yogic views and laugh at its foolishness. After that, to throw the dust of sin into the soul, which is more precious than the priceless Chintamani gem, and to make it impure, how much foolishness should it be considered? Indeed! Those who are attached to worldly pleasures and throw dust on the soul are fools, mad, insane, and worthy of a mental asylum. Because they are intoxicated with worldly pleasures and have become insane!
“In the womb of the mother, the most sacred soul is born – the bearer of the soul.
For example –
धर्मबीजं परं प्राप्य मानुष्यं कर्मभूमिषु । न सत्कर्मकृषावस्य प्रयतन्तेऽल्पमेधसः ॥ ८३ ॥ Having obtained the supreme seed of Dharma in the field of karma, human birth;
Those of little intelligence do not strive in the cultivation of good deeds. 83, Meaning – Having obtained the supreme seed of Dharma in the field of karma, human birth, those of little intelligence do not strive in the cultivation of good deeds.
Discussion “From the accumulation of great merit, the human body is obtained, oh! One of the cycles of birth and death is avoided.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji’s Moksha Mala
Cultivation of good deeds, the seed of Dharma in the field of karma. The main cause of the attainment of Dharma – the supreme seed of Dharma is human birth. Only when there is a seed is there a possibility of a sprout, because only when there is human birth is there a seed. Only when there is a seed can a sprout grow, and only in human birth can full wisdom arise and enter the royal path of liberation – liberation cannot be attained from any other body. Therefore, this human body is the best of all. The wise say that many, many accumulations of merit are gathered – therefore, when the merit shines, this human incarnation is obtained, this human body is extremely rare. Such human birth is also obtained by the accumulation of merit, but
Tendency – Dharma is the seed of Dharma, the cause of Dharma. But – supreme, main, – obtained, did it? What is it – human birth. Where? Then it is – in the field of karma, like the earth. What? Then it is – the cultivation of good deeds, the cultivation of good deeds like the seed of Dharma, etc., but – these, this seed of Dharma, and those of little intelligence do not strive.

##  The Cultivation of Good Karma: A Seed of Dharma in the Land of Dharma

(315) One who is born in an un-Aryan land, even their human birth is wasted. This is because the attainment of Dharma is rare in such a land. Even if Dharma is present, it is likely to be lost. Therefore, an Aryan land is equally essential for the attainment of Dharma. 

"Aryan" refers to those who have quickly distanced themselves from all unworthy, discardable Dharmas. They are honorable people who do not engage in un-Aryan actions like violence, deceit, lust, and attachment. They practice the virtues of right food, right speech, and right conduct. The land where such cultured Aryans reside is called an Aryan land. 

There are six types of Aryans: those who are Aryan by land, by caste, by family, by karma, by knowledge, and by language. Those born in the fifteen Karmabhumi are considered Aryan by land, and so on.

The fifteen Karmabhumi are: the five Bharat, the five Arvat, and the five Videh, excluding Devakuru and Uttar Kuru. These are called Karmabhumi because they are the birthplace of the Tirthankaras, the enlightened beings who are the knowers, doers, and teachers of the path of liberation, the path of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. It is here that those who are born attain liberation, not elsewhere. Therefore, these Karmabhumi are the lands of liberation. They are called Karmabhumi because they are the lands where the efforts for liberation, the efforts of karma, are successful and lead to liberation.

However, even if one is fortunate enough to be born with the precious seed of Dharma, the seed of a noble human birth, and even if one is born in an Aryan land, such as the Bharat, Arvat, or Videh, what is the use if one does not sow this seed, nurture it, and cultivate it with good karma? Such a person is undoubtedly foolish, for they waste this precious human birth, they do not strive for self-liberation, and they do not fulfill their purpose.

Just as a seed that is not sown in suitable soil, nurtured, and cared for will rot and perish, so too will the seed of Dharma. But if it is sown in fertile ground, it will multiply into millions, billions, trillions, countless, infinite seeds. For example, a small seed of a banyan tree, when sown, grows into a large banyan tree. This banyan tree contains countless seeds, each of which produces countless more seeds. Thus, the cycle continues infinitely.

If you have been blessed with the human form, which is the seed of Dharma, and have cultivated it with good conduct in the field of karma, you will be bound to an infinite chain of auspiciousness. In this field of Dharma, which is also a field of karma, there is a perpetual battle between the Pandavas, who represent good conduct, and the Kauravas, who represent evil conduct. When you overcome evil tendencies with the power of your soul, through the true effort of karma yoga, and good conduct prevails, then the cultivation of the seed of Dharma begins, and you will progressively attain a series of auspicious states. Here, the word "karmabhoomi" is very significant. It suggests that just as we have to cultivate crops like grains in the field of karma, sowing seeds and nurturing them to grow, so too, you, who have attained the karmabhoomi, have been born in this field of karma. Therefore, strive for the true effort of karma yoga! Strive! Become virtuous! Become like a lotus! Sow this excellent seed of human form, which is the seed of Dharma, and cultivate it with the practice of good karma. Nurture it with the watering of the worship of the true Dharma, so that it may grow, flourish, and bear infinite fruits.
If you desire the ultimate goal, then make the true effort, taking the name of the state of existence, etc., and do not cut off the soul.
O human! Keep in mind the goal of your own nature, and cultivate the five great vows, which are like grains. Then, the qualities of the transient vision, knowledge, and conduct, etc., will be produced like grains, filling the house of your soul. Then, in your own realm of the soul, there will be a perpetual abundance and prosperity of supreme bliss. Thus, you will gather the happiness of the soul for an infinite period of time. This karmabhoomi is giving a message to the humans of this karmabhoomi! Cultivate the grains of the five great vows, keeping in mind the goal of your own nature, and strive for the means. The transient vision, knowledge, and conduct, etc., are the qualities that will be produced, filling the house of your soul. The supreme vision has entered my realm, and supreme bliss and prosperity have come to my land. Devchandra and Jinchandra have experienced this, and the happiness of the soul will follow them for an infinite period of time.
O Shri Namin, the Lord of the Jains, the cloud of mercy! Shri Devchandraji. + "In the field of Dharma, the field of Kuru, the warriors are gathered, ready to fight. What are my Pandavas doing, Sanjay?"

##  English Translation:

**With a discerning vision, embrace the field of karma and become a karma-vegi!**

(317) Indeed!  Humanity is the expectant cause in the attainment of Dharma and self-realization.  The manifestation of the instrumental cause, such as the vision of the Lord, and the material cause, which manifests as the result of the self, is the success of that expectant cause, that is its account.  Otherwise, what is the point of this existence?  What if one dies?  There is no account for it.  Therefore, attaining the instrumental cause in the form of the right Dharma, and manifesting the material cause in the form of the soul, is the cultivation of this human birth, which is the seed of Dharma.

“The human birth is the first accumulation, know that as the expectant cause; the instrumental cause is dependent on the material cause, that is the account, says Shri Arnatha.  The purpose of the instrumental cause is the Jinaraja, the nectar of equality; the attainment is dependent on the Lord, this is the rule...says Shri Arnatha.  “The purpose of birth is fulfilled, that is the day of success; the world takes refuge in the feet of the Jina, I bow down with joy.” - Shri Devchandraji.  “The human body is rare, as described in ten examples, it is attained through great merit; hurry up and make it meaningful, do not return to this world again.” - (Dr. Bhagwandas)

But the fools, the crown jewels of fools, with their dull intellect, are lovers of existence, and instead of making this human birth, which is the seed of Dharma, meaningful, they waste that seed!  They lose their precious human life, which is like a priceless Cintamani gem, in various kinds of vices, false pride, pleasure, objects of desire, and passions!  They act like fools who throw away a Cintamani gem to scare away a crow!  Therefore, they experience a “wasted incarnation.”

“What increases with wealth and power?  Tell me, does it increase with family or relatives?  This is the wrong path; the increase of the world loses the human body, do not think about it, oh!  You have only one moment!” - Shri Moksha Mala

##  Dimadrusti: 7 Horrible Consequences of Attachment to Objects

(319) The mind, captivated by Kamadeva, becomes enslaved to the world, experiencing sorrow. The foolish, greedy for pleasure, fall into the trap and regret later...

Renouncing the desire for objects, the conscious being finds the true path. Like a bee attracted by the fragrance of a flower, it gets trapped in the bud. The lotus bud, when combined with the bee, becomes a source of sorrow... The beautiful form of the object, like a moth, attracts the mind and it falls into the flame. Seeing this cause of sorrow, the eyes fear, O helper... The deer, attached to the senses in the realm of objects, loses its head. Each attached being experiences various kinds of sorrow... The five objects are powerful and always tempting, what can we say? Hearing the word "Chidananda", we remain in our true nature... "Objects."

- Shri Chidanandaji

Therefore, wise men have compared the pleasure of objects to the foam of a snake or the fruit of a poisonous plant. And it is true that they are called "Kusukh" (false pleasure) or "Asat Sukh" (unreal pleasure). Or, what results in sorrow is not really pleasure, but sorrow. The principle of renunciation or the subsequent sorrow is not pleasure. - Shrimad Rajchandraji

It is appropriate to call this "tucch" (trivial) and "darun" (horrible) here. Because it is trivial, without essence, and like a single thing in the world. The "figo" (gross) hair-like particles of matter, which countless beings have accumulated over time, are enjoyed by the "bhava-abhinandi" (attached to existence) being! And such a being, running after this "tam" (darkness) like the water of a mirage, becomes corrupted from the right path, abandoning the activity of Dharma and duty! Therefore, the sage Acharya expresses his regret - "Oh! This ignorance and darkness, be damned! Because of this, the being forgets its fatherhood and engages in such perverse activity, committing wrong deeds. The poor being is not to blame, but its "mehniya" (attached to pleasure) karma is to blame. Because it is in the form of darkness, it does not see the right direction, the right path does not appear, so it gets confused and abandons the right path and goes astray.

"It is astonishing that the soul, unable to conquer the field of the objects of the senses, claims to be able to conquer the whole earth!" - Shrimad Rajchandraji

**Conclusion:**
The **Avedyasamvedya** state is like blindness, leading to downfall. It can be conquered by the **Satsang-Agam** yoga, only by the great souls. 85.

**Meaning:** This **Avedyasamvedya** state is like blindness, leading to downfall. It can be conquered by the **Satsang-Agam** yoga, only by the great souls.

**Discussion:**
The **Avedyasamvedya** state, as explained above, is like blindness and leads to downfall.

This **Avedyasamvedya** state can only be conquered by the great souls through the **Satsang-Agam** yoga. Just as a blind person, due to his blindness, falls into a deep pit while walking, similarly, due to the blindness of the **Avedyasamvedya** state, the soul falls into the pit of hell and other lower realms. But, if a true guide comes to the blind person, he will not fall into the pit and will walk on the right path. Similarly, if the soul gets the guidance of **Satsang** (good company) and **Agam** (sacred scriptures), it will become aware of the right path and will not fall into the pit of lower realms.

**Interpretation:**
The **Avedyasamvedya** state, with the above-mentioned characteristics, is like blindness. Therefore, it is said to be **Durgaatipaat** - leading to downfall. **Satsang-Agam** yoga means the association with good company and sacred scriptures. This emphasizes the importance of **Purusha-praadhaanya** (the supremacy of the soul). This **Avedyasamvedya** state is conquerable, only by the great souls, because it is impossible to conquer anything else. Therefore, **Agam** also says (in this way, it is appropriate to say) that "I know" (**Jaanaami**) because of the failure of its own rules.

## The Glory of Satsang (31)

**Introduction:**

The text states that Satsang is the sole source of knowledge, not Agam (scripture). This is because the guidance of a virtuous person (Satpurusha) is paramount in the path of liberation. Only a Satpurusha, a true guide, can show the path and lead the ignorant soul (Jiva) towards the right path. This association with a Satpurusha is essential for the Jiva to awaken to the teachings of the scriptures. Even the knowledge of Agam is dependent on the guidance of the Guru. Therefore, the text emphasizes the unity of the cause.

**The Importance of Satsang:**

Wise men have praised the glory of Satsang throughout history. Satsang is the best means for the Jiva to cross the ocean of life. The text quotes a saying: "Even a moment spent in the company of a virtuous person is like a boat that helps one cross the ocean of life." This is because Satsang helps the Jiva to overcome their negative tendencies and cultivate their virtues. Satsang becomes the ultimate support, refuge, and shelter for the Jiva. With the support of Satsang, the Jiva can easily cross the ocean of life and attain liberation. The text emphasizes that no matter how much we praise Satsang, it is never enough. Therefore, it is essential to surrender oneself completely to Satsang.

**The Path to Liberation:**

The text advises those who are determined to attain liberation to first acknowledge their ignorance and then seek refuge in a wise person (Jnani). This is the only way to attain the path of liberation. The text emphasizes that these teachings are the ultimate support and protection for all seekers of liberation. By contemplating these teachings, one can attain the ultimate goal. The text summarizes the essence of the Jain teachings, including the twelve Angas, the six Darshanas, and the knowledge of the Jnani.

**The Importance of Satsang in the Present Age:**

Satsang is the ultimate means for achieving liberation. It is like residing near the feet of a virtuous person. Satsang is rare in all times, but especially in this age of adversity. Wise men have recognized the extreme rarity of Satsang in this age. Those who try to define their own self-nature without the guidance of a Satguru are merely indulging in their own desires. It is essential to recognize that Satsang is the primary means for liberation, and all other means are secondary. The text quotes the teachings of Shankaracharya and Shubhachandracharya, emphasizing the importance of Satsang for liberation.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
It is worthy of worship in all respects; because it makes all means available, such is our self-realization. ”–(See) Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 181-428-518 (211, Ha-Ne. 2-37, 609) E
Such excellent satsang can only be won by the fourfold power of the Agam, by these six-fold great men, because it is only in this role that their victory can be achieved. It is not possible elsewhere, because there is a lack of such worthiness. Previously, there was not as much self-effort to win it, and then it did not arise, it was won. It is. Even in the Agam, there is a statement that the unachievable is the impossibility of the unattainable. Therefore, in this vision, the great yogis are given the ability to win the avedhya-vedhya pad. And that is why it is said that
Such a virtuous person, that avedhya is hard,
The saintly assembly of the Agam, they won the victory... Manmohan.” -Shri Cha, 6. S. 4–10

Vidhatirth Vidyalaya - Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya, under the inspiration and blessings of Pujya Param Pujya Vijay Vallabhasuriswarji Maharaj Saheb, was established on the auspicious day of Monday, the 5th of the bright half of the month of Falgun, Vikram Samvat 1970, 02/03/1914, 100 years ago. Pujya Gurudev saw that proper educational facilities were not available in the small villages and towns of Gujarat. Students who passed with high marks and had a strong desire for higher education were coming to Mumbai for higher studies. Keeping this in mind, Pujya Gurudev inspired the establishment of Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya with the aim of providing facilities for higher education for the youth of our community.

Pujya Gurudev's mind was filled with the idea that higher education should not only be for intellectual development, but also for the all-round development of the seeker of knowledge. With this thought, Pujya Gurudev included the study of religious values along with higher practical education.

At the time of the establishment of the institution, three basic points were considered. Night meals were prohibited, non-vegetarian food was renounced, and religious studies were included along with Jain worship. With these points in mind, Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya was started in 1915 in a rented house with fifteen students. Today, it has grown into a banyan tree, with 12 branches in major cities of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, with hostels and girls' hostels with modern facilities for more than 1600 students.

To move forward in the field of education, the Vidyalaya has established a new trust called Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya Education Foundation and started an MBA college in Vadodara.

To ensure that the youth of our community do not remain deprived of higher professional education due to financial reasons, an interest-free loan assistance scheme is in operation. Under this scheme, the Vidyalaya provides interest-free loans for higher education in India and abroad.

Encouragement to Jain literature and publication: (1) To encourage the publication of books on Jainism, Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya Jinagam Trust has been established. This trust prepares Agam texts and the institution also publishes other books. The late Seth Shri Motichandbhai Kapadia, who was a supporter of the multi-faceted excellence of the institution, had the vision to publish a wealth of critical and research-oriented literature in simple and easy language. For this, the late Seth Shri Motichandbhai Kapadia started the work of editing the series and so far 9 books have been published. Also, Jain Gurjar Kaviyo, Part 1 to 10, and seven other books of the Shri Mohanlal Dalichand Desai (Collector and Editor) series, and two books published by Munishri Nandighosh Vijayji have been published. (2) To promote, propagate and encourage Jain literature, 23 Jain literary festivals have been organized at different places till date.

**Objectives and Implementation and Journey Towards the 21st Century:**

The institution has been steadily moving towards the 21st century, following the fundamental rules that were laid down at the beginning. The following fundamental rules are in effect:

(1) In every branch, a Shikharbandi Derasar has been built in Mumbai, Andheri, Vadodara, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Udaipur, Bhavnagar, and Pune so that students can perform regular Jinpuja. While in the Sandhurst Road branch, there is a home Derasar. The construction of a new Vidhyarthi Gruh has begun in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. A new Jinlay is under construction in both places.

(2) Religious classes are conducted by religious teachers in every branch for the religious curriculum. Regular religious examinations are conducted and students are awarded prizes as encouragement.

(3) Facilities are provided to encourage students to participate in religious tours, development camps, and intense tapascharyas.

(4) Competitions, sports, and exercise equipment are available for the personal and personality development of students, and seminars are organized.

(5) "Inter-branch competitions" are organized by the students of the branch. And prizes are awarded as encouragement.

(6) Libraries have been established in the branches for "general knowledge" for students, along with newspapers, magazines, reference books, and good books.

Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya, over 102 years, has provided the nectar of knowledge to an estimated 20,000 students, making them efficient and self-reliant, and has infused their lives with service, religiosity, and culture.

The great festival of the Vidyalaya, which enriches society, empowers it, and makes it cultured by providing the younger generation with the nectar of knowledge and inspiration, is still going on uninterruptedly.

Great people who are benevolent to society and travelers on the path of virtue! May your generous financial contributions continue to flow into this great festival! Your generosity will make you blessed and enrich society. Don't miss out on this double benefit!

He who strives to expand understanding through the spread of knowledge is a great benefactor of the world. Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya has humbly accepted the life vow to make society prosperous, powerful, and happy through such an endeavor. Helping in the fulfillment of this vow will be a virtuous act and will make one a participant in the welfare of society.

Let us all stand together, day and night, in the service of the Vidyalaya with our body, mind, and wealth, and with the blessings of the Yuga Purusha, with the support of our glorious past, let us step on the path of a beautiful present and realize the dream of a glorious future. That is the prayer...

## Publisher's Statement

According to Jainism, the ultimate goal of a soul is to attain liberation, which is the state of supreme bliss. To achieve this state, aspirants must strive for spiritual growth through the path of yoga and spiritual practices.

The practice of acquiring knowledge is achieved through the study of rare scriptures and yoga. For this purpose, revered Acharyas have graciously provided numerous scriptures for self-study. Among them, *Yogadrushtisamucchya*, authored by Pujya Acharya Haribhadrasuri, stands out as a beacon.

This book illuminates the path of the soul's gradual development for the benefit of aspirants.

To help seekers understand the essence of this book, the esteemed late Dr. Bhagvandas Manaksukhbhai Mehta had written a beautiful commentary years ago. This commentary was published in book form in 1950 (first edition) by Seth Shri Manaksukhbhai Tarachand Mehta in memory of the late Smt. Lilavatiben.

The family of the commentator, the late Dr. Bhagvandas Manaksukhbhai Mehta, is currently without any members. The family of the publisher, the late Seth Shri Manaksukhbhai Tarachand Mehta, has given their consent to republish the *Yogadrushtisamucchya* book, recognizing its religious significance. This consent was given by their daughter Kokilaben V. Parekh and Smt. Arunaben. We wholeheartedly appreciate their generosity.

This new edition is a result of the generous support of Shri Jain Dharma Pedhi, Shri Shrimalipol Jain Sangh, Bharuch, inspired by Pujya Kanakchandra Shah. We are deeply grateful to the Sangh for this noble endeavor.

We express our gratitude to Pandit Shri Pravinchandra Motajiji, the commentator of numerous scriptures from Shri Gittartha Ganga, for granting permission to reprint the "Bhed Prabhed Vriksh" table from his published book in this publication.

We are indebted to Shri Nautambhai Ratilal Shah for the beautiful printing work and to Shri Shrenikbhai Kirtibhai Shah for the equally beautiful proofreading.

Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya holds a unique position in the Jain community and educational institutions. Through the publication of numerous books related to Jinaagamas and Jain philosophy, Shri Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya is engaged in the dissemination of knowledge as a means of spreading the influence of Jainism.

We are delighted to publish the third edition of the *Yogadrushtisamucchya* book. We believe that this book will be a source of well-being in the lives of our devout and studious brothers and sisters, fostering the growth of spiritual aspirants, developing inner nature, and leading everyone towards equality. With faith...

The Mangalacharan of the Critic, the Kalasha Kavya of Yogadristi
Whose origin is the Himala, the abode of Malini Jinavadan,
Whose upward rise is on the head of the Ganadhar-Har; the gods and men are served by the full, sweet water,
The protectors of the Bhagavata Shruta Ganga are we! The sweet nectar flows, removing the delusion of the self,
It establishes the path for all, doing good to the world; like the best boat in the ocean of birth,
I bow to the words of the Jainendra, the mother of Shiva-Sukha.
Anustup, infinite in the saints, one, the lineage plays;
Like the ocean of nectar, I bow to the mental solace.
| The high caste flies in the sky of consciousness,
O Swan! O self-formed one; you are the critics of the soul,
| You play in the minds of the seekers. You are the master of pure consciousness,
You are the essence of the soul; you are the enjoyer of the qualities of the soul,
You are the yogi of the experiences of the soul. Remembering the great guru,
Srimad Haribhadra Suriendra Deva; to follow his activities,
I wish to criticize something in one place. This is the Salfaastra critic,
I will criticize Sumanananda's, and I will make the Kalasha of Yogadristi,
I will take the nectar of yoga, born of it.

Oh! This Atma is of infinite power, illuminating the universe. By the power of Dhyana Shakti, it moves the three worlds.

**Diima:**  Aghaseva Kutarkathah Nivritti
(323) Visham Kutarkagraha Nida Adhikar,  Etla Mate Jayaling (Jayana Chihno) Kahe Che - 
Jiyaamane Cha Niyamadetasminstatvato Nrinaam. Nivartate Svato'tyantam Kutarkavishamgrahah. ||86|| 

This verse, according to the rule, from the truth, for humans, completely, naturally, removes the grasp of the contradictory logic. 86. 

Meaning - And when this Avedyasamvedyapada is conquered, by the rule, humans, from the truth, completely, naturally, are freed from the grasp of contradictory logic. 

Commentary - It is easily overcome, this contradictory logic; like an elephant, it is killed by the near one, it does the bad thinking... Manmohan - Shri. A.D.S. 4-11

And this Adyasamvedyapada, which is the cause of Maha Mithyatva, and is known by the words like Pashupana, etc., when it is conquered, from the ultimate truth, the human, the contradictory logic, in the form of a grasp, naturally, goes away. In Upmaha Mithyatva, the Avedyasamvedyapada is described in great detail, from that, it is clear that whatever the cause of Maha Mithyatva, it is that Avedyasamvedyapada. Due to its influence, the Jiva is ignorant of the Atma, holds the Atma-buddhi in the Anatma, considers the self and the other as one, considers the body as the Atma, forgets the knowledge of the Atma, considers the Sat as Asat and the Asat as Sat. In this way, the cause of deep Mithyatva - Asatva - is this Adyasamvedyapada. And due to this confusion, it is called Pashupana, Gamarpana, Abujhpana, Moodhpana, etc. Because, "The knowledge of the confused, like animals, is completely absorbed by external objects, and the self-substance, i.e., the self-form, is abandoned, and becomes empty. Thus, in the form of...

Vritti-Giyamane Ja Niyamatasmin - And this Avedyasamvedyapada, by the rule, is conquered; that is, when this Maha Mithyatva, in the form of a restriction, known by the words like Pashu, etc., is conquered, 
Svar - From the truth, from the ultimate truth, to the humans, to the men, 
Nivartate Svat: - It is naturally, from the self, without the instruction of another, it is removed. It is overcome - due to the absence of the cause, due to the absence of the cause. 
Atyantam - Completely, due to the knowledge-yoga, due to the knowledge of the Agama authority. 
Jitapinaak - Kutarkarupa Vishamgraha - The contradictory logic, in the form of a grasp, like a planet (planet, sun, moon, etc., or ghost, or crocodile).

Yagadasisamuccaya
The knowledge of an animal that has become tranquil is clear from all sides. But the fact that it is what it is, that it is here in its form, is the knowledge of the Syadvadi, which is filled with the nature of a dense substance that rises above the extremely agitated, and it becomes unified, it remains floating above like an owl.
Such an incomprehensible, ignorant animal-like false reasoning, like an unperceivable, perceivable state, as it is conquered, so the false reasoning, subject to it, the false reasoning, the heterogeneous fallacies that arise from it, disappear on their own, are removed; because the rule of logic is that the absence of the cause of the false reasoning, or the absence of the cause, leads to the absence of the effect. The birthplace of fallacies is false reasoning. Therefore, as false reasoning is removed, or with it, fallacies also disappear, because when the root cause is eliminated, the subsequent cause becomes rootless and unsupported. Just as a building collapses when the main supporting pillar breaks, so the building of fallacies collapses completely when the foundation of false reasoning breaks. The airy castles of fallacies disappear in a flash. Just as when a king is conquered, the entire army is conquered, so when false reasoning is conquered, its family-like army of fallacies is also conquered. And thus, these fallacies are destroyed automatically, on their own; there is no need for anyone else's instruction.
Fallacy means corrupt reasoning, false, wrong reasoning, which is inherently corrupt, wrong, false, and false, that is fallacy. The grasp of this fallacy, the crooked obsession, the heterogeneous attachment, is rightly called so. Because it truly dwells. It harasses and harasses the living being; moreover, there is no place for this fallacy, no order, it jumps this way and that, like a turban that can be worn in any way! To make the wrong right and the right wrong is its work. And so on, the heterogeneity of fallacy is evident. This heterogeneous 'grasp' of fallacy is compared to a planet in many ways: (1) A planet is the sun, moon, Rahu, etc. Just as a malevolent planet, an evil planet, afflicts a human being, causing suffering, it troubles him, so a corrupt planet in the form of fallacy afflicts a human being, causing suffering, it troubles him. Or, just as a corrupt planet like Rahu, like a sinful planet, swallows the moon, causing it to become hot, so this corrupt, heterogeneous, sinful planet swallows the soul, the moon, and makes it extremely

**Dimari:**  The vicious, illogical, and deceptive mind is an enemy to the soul (325) and causes great suffering. Thus, it is a heavy "Vasa" (obsession) (2). Or, "Graha" (obsession) means a ghost, demon, or plant. Just as a ghost, demon, or plant may cling to someone, not leaving them alone, holding them captive, and causing them distress, so too, this vicious ghost, demon, or plant, when it clings to a being, does not leave them alone, holding them captive, making it difficult to remove, and causing them great suffering. For one whose mind is filled with a vicious ghost (obsession, delusion), it becomes very difficult to remove it, it becomes a great challenge to overcome this affliction! Thus, illogical reasoning is a "Vicious Graha" (obsession) (3). Or, "Graha" (obsession) means a crocodile. Just as a crocodile, when it grabs something, makes it very difficult to escape its grasp, so too, one who is caught in the clutches of a vicious Graha (obsession), like a crocodile, finds it very difficult to escape its grip. In this way too, illogical reasoning is truly a "Vicious Graha" (obsession). Thus, in any sense of the word "Graha" (obsession), whether it be a wicked planet, a ghost, or a crocodile, the term "Graha" (obsession) is aptly applied to illogical reasoning, and it is also a "Vicious Graha" (obsession). It is a heavy, difficult, and challenging obstacle, which makes one go astray and leads to misfortune.

Such a being, who holds one captive, who keeps one in their grasp, the vicious, sinful Graha (obsession), or ghost, or crocodile, upon attaining the state of non-violence, automatically releases its hold. Just as the recitation of mantras for planetary peace brings an end to the suffering caused by a sinful Graha (obsession), just as the chanting of mantras by a sorcerer removes the possession of a ghost, just as a strike to the vital spot releases the grip of a crocodile; so too, the state of non-violence, the recitation of mantras, and the use of weapons, like planetary peace, automatically release the hold of the vicious Graha (obsession) (in all three senses, as far as possible) from the father.

Is this illogical reasoning unique? To this, it is said:

"Bodharogaḥ śamāpāyaḥ śraddhābhaṅgo'bhimāna-kṛt | Kutarkaścetaso vyaktaṁ bhāvaśatruḥ aneka-dhā || 87 ||"

**Commentary:**

"Ghoshon:" - Due to the attachment to passion, it causes harm to the established state of being, and thus, it is a source of suffering. It is a generator of false attachment, which leads to harm.

"Shraddham:" - It is a destroyer of faith, due to the inability to understand the meaning of the scriptures. It is a generator of pride and arrogance, due to the false belief in one's own understanding.

Thus, "Jiyamaane'tra rājñīva camacara-paricchadaḥ | Nivartite tataḥ śīrghā viṣamakaḥ" - "When the king is victorious, his army becomes more powerful and his authority increases." - Shri Kshamaala.

A collection of fallacies is a poison to the wise, a destroyer of faith;
It fills the mind with doubt, manifesting in many ways. 87. Meaning - It is a disease to the intellect, a hindrance to calmness, a destroyer of faith, and a source of pride for those who indulge in it. This fallacy is a foe to the mind in many ways.
Commentary: This harmful fallacy, which is called a "graha" (a grasping, clinging), is evil and destructive. Its specific nature is described here. This fallacy (1) is a disease to the intellect, (2) a hindrance to calmness, (3) a destroyer of faith, and (4) a source of pride. Thus, it is a foe to the mind in many ways, an enemy of the ultimate goal.
The fallacy that is a foe to the mind: 1. A disease to the intellect - This fallacy is a poison to the intellect, to right knowledge, because it obstructs true understanding. Just as a disease harms the body, weakens it, so too does this fallacy harm and weaken true understanding. Just as a disease weakens the body, makes its limbs weak, and makes the body thin, so too does this fallacy weaken the mind's ability to think, making the intellect weak, sluggish, and thin. Thus, the intellect becomes bound by this fallacy.
Therefore, just as a sick person cannot digest heavy food, so too a person afflicted with this fallacy, this disease, cannot digest the supreme food of right knowledge. Instead, it causes indigestion! That is why wise people say that it is not praiseworthy to give scriptural knowledge to someone who is not worthy of it, who has not been freed from this harmful grasping. Just as it is not appropriate to give a kingdom to a person who is a thief, so too it is not appropriate to give scriptural knowledge to someone who is not free from this harmful grasping. Just as water kept in a cracked pot destroys both the water and the pot, so too does scriptural knowledge given to someone who is not free from this harmful grasping destroy both the knowledge and the person. To give advice to someone who is overwhelmed by this harmful grasping is like applying musk to the body of a dog! The meaning of the scriptures, which is hard to obtain, is corrupted by this harmful grasping.
Therefore, this fallacy is a destroyer of the mind, the inner being, in many ways, due to reasons such as the rejection of the teachings of the wise.

##  Translation:

**1.**  The *kutak* (obstruction) of *dimaddi* (pride) causes two types of harm: *shamap* (peace) and *aady* (beginning). It is like planting a seed that was obtained with hundreds of efforts in barren land, and then feeling regret. Because, even though one listens to the scriptures from a knowledgeable guru, they never follow their instructions. They consider themselves to be wise like a sieve, which only holds the coarse grains. Just as a sieve holds the coarse grains, this person holds onto the coarse *desh* (faults) and takes pride in their discernment. Their cleverness is for hypocrisy, their knowledge of scriptures is for sin, their talent is for deception, and their patience is for arrogance. Alas! The qualities of an *asadugrah* (one who holds onto the negative) are opposite to their true nature. Therefore, an *asadugrah* patient cannot digest even the most nourishing milk.

**2.** The *kutak* of *shamap* (peace) is harmful because it gives rise to *asat* (false) attachment and stubbornness. It creates false waves in the mind, disturbing the peace of the mind and leading the soul astray. It is like a fire that burns down a beautiful and cool garden, leaving it barren. Where the inner self is burnt by this fire of *asadugrah*, how can the vine of *tattvanishchay* (realization of truth) grow? One must then search for the flowers of peace and the fruits of good advice elsewhere. A person whose mind is clouded by *asadugrah* cuts the vine of truth with the sharp blade of *kutak*, waters the tree of faults with their own essence, and throws away the delicious fruit of peace.

**3.** The *kutak* of *shraddha bhang* (breaking of faith) breaks faith because it leads to non-understanding and rejection of the meaning of the scriptures. It breaks the faith in the scriptures and destroys faith. *Kutak* is like a thorn that prevents faith from taking root in the heart. Just as water cannot penetrate stony ground and a sprout cannot grow, so too, *sad* (good) cannot enter a stony heart of *asadugrah*. 

Page #404:
---------------------------
(38)
If the essence of true understanding does not enter, and the pure seed of knowledge does not sprout, what is the fault of the teachings? Even if one observes vows, practices austerities, and purifies the body through effort, if no fruit is obtained, it is the fault of *asadugrah*, because they lack faith. If laddoos are served on a plate, but someone presses down on the throat, how can one eat? Similarly, "The plate is *svabuddhi*, the server is the *sadguru*, and the intoxicating knowledge is served, but the *asadugrah* is the evil throat-presser who does not allow it to be swallowed!" That is, it does not allow faith to arise.

4. *Abhimanakar* - one who is arrogant, generates *mithyabhiman* (false pride). They are independent of the scriptures. The one who engages in *kutark* (sophistry) develops pride in their own reasoning ability, thinking, "I am so intelligent, so wise, I can easily refute what the scriptures say with my superior logic!" etc. They disregard the scriptures, keeping them at bay. But all this is their false pride. Because, "One who considers themselves a scholar by learning and hearing, but with *asadugrah*, may kiss the mouth of the scriptures, but they do not understand their subtle meaning."

Thus, this *visham kutark-grah* (perverted reasoning-grasp) is a disease-causing, peace-disturbing, faith-breaking, and false-pride-generating factor. It is also said elsewhere:

"शमारामानलबाला हिमानी ज्ञानपङ्कजे ।
શ્રદ્ધા રાન્ચે સ્પોટ્ટાણઃ કુતરું: યુનારા ” - Shri Yashovijayji, Dv. Dv. 23

Meaning: *Kutark* is like a fire to the garden of knowledge, like frost to the lotus of knowledge, like a thorn to faith, like a wave of pride, and like a finger to the wise.

And this is why this *kutark* mind - the inner being - is in many ways:

" असद्ग्रहनावमये हि चित्ते, न क्वापि सद्भावरसप्रवेशः ।
इहांकुरश्चित्तविशुद्धबोधः, सिद्धांतवाचां बत कोऽपराधः ॥ स्थालं स्वबुद्धिः सुगुरोश्च दातुरुपस्थिता काचन मोदकाली ।
રાસ રોડ છે હીતા, તથાપિ મોવડુ ન વરાતિ સુદઃ ”—Shri Adhyatmasar. x

Deeprashti: Attachment to Kutaraka is inappropriate for the seeker of liberation (329)
It is an enemy of the soul, an enemy of the ultimate goal. Just as an external enemy harms and destroys, this enemy of the soul does not hesitate to cause harm to the being, because 
Kutaraka causes disrespect to the highly revered Satpurush, Sadagam, etc., due to its nature or its effects. It leads to disrespect and criticism of the teachings, and thus causes great harm to the being. Just as an enemy is always eager to destroy, so too, this enemy of the soul in the form of Kutaraka always seeks to weaken and destroy the mental faculties. Therefore, whoever engages in Kutaraka is doing the work of their own enemy! They are their own enemy!
*
And because this is so, what then? For this, it is said— कुतर्केऽभिनिवेशस्तन्न युको मुक्तिवादिनाम् ।
युक्तः पुनः श्रुते शीले समाधौ च महात्मनाम् ॥ ८८ ॥ 
Kutarke abhiniveshastanna yuko muktivadinam.
Yuktah punah shrute sheele samaadhau cha mahatmanam. 88
A—Therefore, it is not appropriate for the seekers of liberation (mumukhus) to be attached to Kutaraka; but it is appropriate for the Mahatmas to be attached to Shruta, Sheela, and Samadhi.
Commentary
Attachment to Kutaraka, which has the characteristics mentioned above, is in no way appropriate for the seekers of liberation (sannyasis, mumukhus), because it is inappropriate to combine intellect with Kutaraka, and to forcefully combine Kutaraka with intellect.
Vritti: Kutaraka—Kutaraka, with the characteristics mentioned above, abhinivesha—attachment, in that way, its grasping nature. What? So—na—not, yuko—appropriate. To whom? So—muktivadinam—seekers of liberation, sannyasis. Yuktah punah—but it is appropriate, shrute—in Shruta, in the teachings, sheele—in Sheela, in conduct characterized by refraining from harming others, sau cha—and in Samadhi, in the state of deep meditation, mahatmanam—for the Mahatmas, the seekers of liberation, attachment is appropriate.

## Collection of Yogic Insights

**Back**

The mark of attachment is like putting a pot where there is no water... it is ridiculous! 'The mind of the average person, like a calf, follows the cow of cunning, but the mind of a foolishly attached person, like a monkey, pulls the cow of cunning by its tail!' - It pulls cunning around! Such foolish attachment is not to be done by a seeker, because the seeker only desires liberation, and has no other desire or attachment except for the soul.

**(330)** The seeker is **rightly**

**Unrightly**

'The soul is one, not another' - attachment. Shrimad Rajchandraji

And this attachment to sophistry is opposed to liberation and is against the soul - it is intoxicating, because the seeker desires the means, and sophistry, becoming a form of anger, destroys it or causes harm. The seeker desires peace of the soul, the ultimate peace, and sophistry is harmful to that peace, it is against liberation. The seeker considers faith to be the first step in the path of liberation, and tries to be steadfast in it, and sophistry breaks faith and makes it unsteady. The seeker, knowing that 'speech is the dharma, silence is the tapas', is extremely humble and always tries to be obedient to dharma; and sophistry, being self-willed, creates false pride in the being. Thus, sophistry is the enemy of the being's emotions in many ways. Therefore, there is never any kind of meeting between the seeker and sophistry, there is a vast difference between them, a clear distinction like light and darkness, they can never meet.

6

Therefore, how can a true seeker accept sophistry, which is a hindrance to his desired goal? And if he does not accept it, he will not even touch it from afar, then how can he hold on to it in the form of attachment? Truly! A true seeker of liberation, knowing sophistry to be like Rahu to the moon of the soul, will not desire to accept it; knowing sophistry to be like a ghost or a demon, he will not desire to cling to it; knowing sophistry to be like a crocodile, he will not desire to be caught by it, to fall into its clutches. He will always run away from sophistry, he will never be attached to it. And it is right for the seeker to do so, because the knowers of the path of yoga, for the benefit of future seekers, have said this word of warning against sophistry: 'Those who argue and counter-argue, they are not certain of the truth.'

"वादांश्च प्रतिवादांश्च वदन्तो निश्चितांस्तथा ।
सवां नैव इति तिरुवीयनुत्तौ ॥” Shri Haribhadracharya's Shri Yagabindu.

## Deeprapti: Attachment to Shruta, Sheel, and Samadhi

(331)

It is not like the play of a blindfolded man on a grinding stone. The blindfolded man on the grinding stone keeps spinning around, but how long does he spin? He is unaware of it. Similarly, those who are blind due to their attachment to their own opinions, argue in strange ways, yet they do not understand the truth that is revealed.

“You think about the arguments, but you don't reach the end.
Those who speak about the truth, are rare in this world.
...They see the stones, but they don't see the other things.” - Shri Anandghanji

Therefore, a seeker should not be attached to anything at all. But if a seeker should be attached to anything, it should be to the Shruta, the eternal scriptures. They should be attached to Sheel, the conduct that is free from betrayal, and to Samadhi, the state of meditation. Because Shruta, Sheel, and Samadhi are such auspicious places that attachment to them, meaning deep immersion, firm conviction, and steadfast adherence, is beneficial and highly commendable for the seeker who desires liberation. Although attachment in the form of stubbornness, prejudice, and opinionatedness is completely undesirable and should be abandoned, the attachment to Shruta, etc., mentioned here is not of that kind. It is of the nature of steadfastness and truthfulness, and is highly commendable. Here, attachment means deep immersion.

Therefore, attachment to Shruta means to worship the Shruta with firm devotion, to dive into the ocean of Shruta and understand its meaning. Attachment to Sheel means to adhere to Sheel, pure conduct, firmly, tightly, and steadfastly, to cling to it, and to serve it without any break or interruption. Attachment to Samadhi means to enter Samadhi firmly and remain unshaken, to attain such a state of stability that no fear, doubt, or disturbance can affect it, and to achieve an unbroken state of self-absorption.

Thus, in the commendable sense of firm devotion to Shruta, Sheel, and Samadhi, attachment to them is highly desirable for the seeker. Because Shruta, Sheel, and Samadhi are the best means to achieve the seeker's desired goal of liberation, therefore, it is highly desirable for the seeker to be firmly attached to them, to be devoted to them, and to immerse themselves in them.

The seed of this (karma) is the supreme, proven, infallible, and beneficial for all beings, selfless service, which is perfectly pure. 89.
Meaning: The seed of this (karma) is the supreme, proven, infallible, and beneficial for all beings, selfless service, which is perfectly pure. Therefore, it is appropriate to be attached to it.
"Worship the Lord, adorn yourself with virtue, and engage in selfless service." - Shrimad Rajchandraji
And the Shruta, Shila, and Samadhi, which are worthy of attachment in the above, are also proven and established for all beings.
What is the ultimate reason for this? It is revealed here - the ultimate seed of Shruta, etc., is selfless service, which is the production of benefit for others. Thus, all beings, including Kulgi, etc., have agreed and established this. And this seed of selfless service gives the infallible fruit of attaining Shruta, etc.
This selfless service should not harm anyone else, it should not cause any harm to others, it should be perfectly pure. It is appropriate for the aspiring great souls to be attached to such pure selfless service, because this selfless service is the cause of the cause of Shruta, etc. Therefore, the advice of the virtuous is that the aspiring soul should become a benefactor, become addicted to the work of selfless service. Shri Vyasa has said in the Bhagavata: "He who desires the other shore, let him not be a sinner!"
Therefore, the aspiring soul, who desires liberation, should dedicate all the power of his body, mind, wealth, and words to the benefit of others. And the seed of this (karma), Shruta, etc., is the supreme, proven, established, infallible, and certain fruit-bearing, for all beings, including all beings, especially those in the Kali Yuga. What is it? It is said - selfless service, the production of benefit for others. Therefore, because of this, which is perfectly pure, without harming others, it is appropriate to be attached to this selfless service. 

Page #409:
---------------------------
## Domaashti: Anidhas Gat Vikalp, Teena Yaajak Kutark (333)

It is appropriate to spend for the benefit of other beings. One should dedicate their body to service, their mind to the welfare of others, their speech to good purposes, their wealth to alleviate the suffering of the poor and distressed, and contribute their efforts to the betterment of the world. Because the virtues of the righteous are for the benefit of others. "Patray Saan Trimoortiyah." And such acts of benevolence should be pure, meaning completely pure. This means that one should ensure that no harm is caused to another being, and that the benefit of one does not come at the expense of another. Any act that is performed without causing any suffering to any being is pure benevolence. Also, there should be no expectation of any reward in this life or the next for such acts of benevolence. Acts of benevolence should be selfless, and only then are they considered "pure."

(334)
This is a collection of fallacies, meaning it is completely filled with knowledge-obscuring things. Wherever there is an alternative, there is also ignorance, and there is always an emergence of knowledge-obscuring alternatives. And this fallacy is the one that creates, nourishes, and arranges these ignorant alternatives. Is this dung or milk? Is this milk or dung? This kind of fallacy is the producer of such contradictory alternatives. Ignorance-shaped sculptor-links create the stone of imagination-shaped alternatives! And fallacy plans, arranges, and connects this stone of imagination! So it is the original sculptor! Its sculpture-creation is also imaginative, all in the air! Like castles in the air! And the fallacy is the one who connects the stones of this air castle! So then all the construction is falsely imagined and airy! And what happens to the one who tries to build it? It breaks into pieces or something else?
The foolish being holds in his mind, the fallacy of alternatives, always painful; meditate on Brahman, always very bright, far away from all the worldly things.”
Shri Devchandraji's Dravyaprakash
Then what is the purpose of this fallacy that arranges these ignorance-driven alternatives? What is its purpose? Nothing. The root of the alternative is ignorance, and the one who nourishes it is fallacy. Then, why would a wise person engage in such evil, harmful, useless, and poisonous fallacies? This world is born from ignorance-born alternatives, then why would a seeker of liberation, who desires the end of the world, take refuge in alternatives? The most capable, experienced, and concise conclusion of all philosophy, the great sage Shrimad Rajchandraji has declared:
“This whole world arises from the alternative of attachment; the inward, non-dual, does not merge.”
Also—
“All this is mainly based on the fruit of perception. Like the elephant will kill, the vow of the mahout, like the alternative of obtained and not obtained.”
* “The sculpture of the body is created by the science of biology.
Then what is the name of this fallacy, which is created by the alternative of the body?”

##  Diimadrusti:  Kutarak Dushanbhasapradhan

(335)  This is a perception-failing, bound by jatipray, all speculation;
Like, will the elephant kill?  There is an option of attainable-unattainable, meaning-and perception-bound, this is all kutarak jatipray - dushanbhasapradhan.  "The elephant will kill" was said, will the elephant kill the one who has attained-is near?  Or will it kill the one who has not attained-is far away? - like this option,
The discussion and all this kutarak is all jatipray, dushanbhasapradhan.  Where it is, it is its job to find the dushanbhas!  Not the dushan, but the dushan-like illusion, anything that appears like dushan, it is the job of kutarak to find the hole!  "Like extracting butter from milk, even in an innocent, flawless thing, to find the deceit, is the skill of kutarak!
"Vayuakt Sadhane Proktadoṣāṇāmudbhāvanam |
Tūṣvi Nirva Tu Tūṣāma Naman!"  Shri Siddhasen Divakar's Nyayavtar, this kutarak is bound by perception and fruit, that is, no matter what kutarak, it does not produce perception, and it is not accepted, there is always doubt.  And "Sanshayatma Virati" - the doubting being is destroyed.  Kutarak perception, as well as its fruit, does not produce any benefit.  It is just a useless head-bound waste.  Therefore, a humorous example has been presented here - the elephant will kill, the mahout said, will the elephant kill the one who is near?  Or will it kill the one who is far away?  Like this option, like someone makes a fool of themselves, it is to be understood here.  The elephant kills near and far, like that fool thinks."  The essence of this example is as follows -
A naive logician (student) came from somewhere.  Someone who was riding a mad elephant, who was completely uncontrolled, shouted, "Hey! Hey!  Get away quickly!  (Otherwise) the elephant will kill you."  So, the one who was proficient in logic - who had studied but not understood - said, "Hey!  Fool!  Why are you talking nonsense like this?  Because, does it kill the one who is attainable?  Or the one who is unattainable?  In the first case, there is a chance of death - due to the feeling of attainment.  So, where he says, there, the elephant has stayed - caught him.  The mahout barely saved him.
Jatiprayata is present in all sensations that have a different meaning-grasping nature - due to the option of form in the form of attainment, it has been discussed elsewhere.

A student of some kind of logic-jurisprudence came across a mad elephant running wild. The mahout riding the elephant shouted, "Hey, hey! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Otherwise, the elephant will kill you!" So, the student, who was learned but not wise, started to apply the methods of his learned jurisprudence to the situation, saying, "Hey, you fool! What are you saying, without any logic or reason? Because, does this elephant kill those who come near it, or those who don't come near it? If you say it kills those who come near it, then it will be you who gets killed!" While he was still continuing his argument, the elephant reached him and caught him. Then, the mahout barely saved him. In the same way, a being who is situated in such a kind of perception, due to his cunning nature, is caught by the cunning elephant, and is only saved by the wise mahout. 

Another humorous example of this is: Is the pot dependent on the ghee, or is the ghee dependent on the pot? To prove this, the learned scholar turned the pot upside down, and the ghee poured out!

Thus, wherever there is a perception that interprets things differently, there is jatipraayata. That is, to interpret something with a different intention than what was intended, to "twist the meaning," is jatipraayata, a kind of delusion. And to make a choice based on that is also the same, and is therefore a kind of jatipraay-delusion. "Naat tooshurrmasaah pakshaavihurt na chai:" The meaning is that to understand something in a way that is opposite to what was intended, and to make a choice based on that, is called jati or delusion. Like the English proverb, "To mistake chalk for cheese." "I have no doubt, the fool thinks; the lazy guru, the disciple, that is the kind of word...mind." - Shri K.D. Sajay. 4-12

Also,
"Svaabhavoत्तरपर्यन्त एषोऽसावपि तत्त्वतः । नार्वाग्दृग्गोचरो न्यायादन्यथान्येन कल्पितः ॥ ९२ ॥"
Kritti: - 3maavottparayant gg: - This cunning one is also ultimately dependent on his nature. Ultimately, "nature" is the answer to the cunning. And here, "vatumaanvairaan vachche vastusvaabhavo wade karine uttar kehwa yogya che, e vachan uparthi." Thus, fire burns, water wets. That is its nature. This feeling, too, is, tattvatah - truly, from the ultimate reality, - naarvaad - not a subject of perception, vaaya - according to logic, not based on any other logic. What kind of logic?

The Deepradrishti: The final answer to the sophism is "nature".
(337) Nature stands as the final answer; the sophism is that, such is its impression, that nature is also not truly perceived by the one with a false perception, the chhadmastha; because it is conceived differently from the other, from the other, 92.
Meaning: - This is the sophism where nature is the final answer; and this nature is also not perceived by the one with a false perception, the chhadmastha, because it is conceived differently from the other, from the other.
Critique
The specific form of this sophism has been stated here - this sophism is such that its final answer is "nature". When no other argument or tactic works, it is finally said that this is the nature of this thing. It has been said that "it is said that the answer is given from the nature of the thing". Thus, fire burns - burns, water wets, because it is its nature.
And that nature is also not perceived by the one with a false perception, the chhadmastha, from the truth - from the ultimate truth. What is the nature of a certain thing? To know it from the truth is not the subject of the chhadmastha, that is, the one who has not completely removed the veil of knowledge. The one who has not completely removed the veil of knowledge, the chhadmastha, is not capable of knowing it. Why? Because of the other-than-conception justice, which is famous among the darshanas. How? It is that - it is conceived differently from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other, from the other,

The collection of fallacies, on the other hand, imagines it in a different way, from a different type of argument. Thus, since the knowledge of the pseudo-existent, whose revelation has not been avoided, is imaginary, the bizarre imagination of the pseudo-existent does not match! And it becomes "mundemunde matirminda" "different minds in different brains"! One will imagine the north, while another will imagine the south! Diametrically Opposite! The pseudo-existent does not have direct knowledge, so it has to rely on hypothetical imagination everywhere, and from imagined knowledge, many imagined waves of imagination arise; because, according to the maxim "to speak the truth from the nature of things," it can be said to be achieved in this way everywhere. It is in this way - by which it has the nature to perform the meaning, by which it performs the meaning - not by momentariness. And any meaning action occurs from the nature of that thing. This action is accepted in all feelings, and an occasion for such meaning action can be created from anywhere, because there is no difference in its cause.
So who will say that fire, in the presence of water, wets, because it has that kind of nature! And water, in the presence of fire, burns - burns, because it has that kind of nature! Or, because of the strangeness of that nature, a different kind of nature can also be imagined, which does not produce a lake! Because there is an abundance of examples everywhere that confirm such natures! It is easy to get such a suitable example from anywhere!
In this way, the one who argues fallaciously always takes refuge in the nature of things for the sake of achieving the father's view - the father's imagination, and this is the nature of things, in the end, he tries to silence the common man by giving an answer and shutting his mouth with an example! And he does not worry - no matter how, from anywhere, he finds a nature that suits his imagination! Because
the nature is strange, and it is easy to find an example that fits it everywhere! It doesn't take much effort to get it! For example, everyone knows that fire is inherently hot and burns, yet the one who argues fallaciously will try to prove that, look! Fire has the nature to wet in the presence of water, because water also wets! Similarly, water is inherently cold and has the nature to wet, yet the one who argues fallaciously will argue that water has the nature to burn in the presence of fire, because flying water burns! That is a direct experience. Because it is its nature. In this way, under the guise of the nature of things, the one who argues fallaciously twists and turns to fit the father's mind! Thus, there is no shortage of examples, and

## Deepradrushti: The 'Misunderstanding' of the Argument in the Form of 'Chhast Panaru'
(339)

There are no arguments on the side of 'Chhast Panaru'! Therefore, such an argument is completely misunderstood, inappropriate, and unsuitable. It is without any structure or foundation, and that is the truth. And for that very reason, it is appropriate for the soul-liberated yogi to abandon it from afar.

★ This is what is being said, and it is being shown in detail—

**ears:** क्लेदयत्यम्बुसन्निधौ दहतीति च । safoeनधौ तत्स्वाभाव्यादित्युदिते तयोः ॥ ९३ ॥

Fire moistens in the presence of water, and water burns in the presence of fire. Both of these happen due to their own nature. This is what is said by some. 93.

**Meaning:** Therefore, fire moistens in the presence of water, and water burns in the presence of fire. This happens because of the nature of both of them. When someone says this—

**Analysis**

The above statement is explained in detail: The nature of the presented object is not understood by the 'Arvaasht Chhadmasth' (one who is veiled by ignorance). The 'Chhadmasth' cannot know the true nature of the object. Therefore, fire moistens in the presence of water, or water burns in the presence of fire. Because fire has such a nature, some argue. What then? Its investigation is mentioned in the following verse. Fire's true nature is hot, and therefore it burns. Everyone knows this, yet those who argue will say: Fire's nature is to moisten, because fire moistens in the presence of water. Hot water moistens, this is directly seen.

**Explanation:** Because the presented nature is not understood by the 'Arvaangdayar-Dmath' (one who is veiled by ignorance), therefore, fire moistens. To avoid the contradiction of direct experience, it is said: In the presence of water. The explanation is: Or water burns. Because this understanding is not correct, it is said: In the presence of fire. Why is this so? It is said: Because of their own nature. Because fire and water have such a nature, it is said by the 'Parvadi' (one who argues). When someone argues—

(340)
Yoga-Dristi-Samuchaya
Water is inherently cool and therefore gets wet, yet a sophist will try to prove that water's nature is to burn, because water burns in the presence of fire, hot water burns, this is a direct experience. Thus, a sophist can extract a meaning that pleases his father from the same thing, under the guise of the nature of things!
What? He says
कोशपानादृते ज्ञानोपायो नास्त्यत्र युक्तितः। विप्रकृष्टोऽप्ययस्कान्तः स्वार्थकद्दश्यते यतः ॥ ९४ ॥  There is no way of knowing other than by memorizing, this is established by logic! Because even though it is far away, the lodestone;
Always performs its own work, it is seen here, 94
Meaning- Here, there is no way of knowing other than by memorizing, because even a far-off lodestone is seen to perform its own work (the work of the father).
Then someone will say that there is no other way of knowing than by memorizing (memorizing the words, that is)! This can be established in the context of nature by the logic of the dry. He who speaks of nature will, in turn, argue as above, using the logic of the same nature. He will then object to the far-fetched argument, that is, the remoteness, and this too can be removed by the example of the lodestone: even a far-off lodestone attracts iron, that is, it is seen to have the nature of performing the work of the father, such as attracting iron.
Kritti- There is no way of knowing other than by memorizing, in the context of nature, because there is another example that supports this meaning, established by logic, by the logic of dry reasoning, therefore it is said - विलोडरदांन्तः- far-off lodestone, the one who performs its own work, the one who has the nature of performing its own work, such as attracting iron, is seen because it is seen.
But the same far-off lodestone attracts only iron, not copper, etc., it does not cut it. Therefore, just as this, how is the nature of fire, etc., affected by the burning? It is appropriate to think that it is not affected by anything. 

Page #417:
---------------------------
##  Dimādr̥ṣṭi: Daṣṭāntapradhāna Kutarka-nā Cūṇṭhaṇ:

(341) Because it remains far away, it attracts iron, not when it is near; it attracts only nearby iron, not copper, etc.; it attracts iron, it does not cut it. Because that is the nature of the magnet.

Therefore, in this way, how can the nature of fire, etc., be known? By nothing, it is thought. Any nature can be established by cleverness and the strength of examples, therefore, there is no good in criticizing such logic, there is no value. The seeker of liberation, who is seeking liberation, should only give a respectful bow to this evil logic!

Concluding, it is said –

**Daṣṭāntamātraṁ sarvatra yadevaṁ sulabhaṁ kṣitau |  Etatpradhānastatkena svanyātyāpodyate hyayam || 95 ||**

Meaning – Thus, examples are easily available everywhere on earth. Therefore, how can this logic, which is based on examples, be refuted by its own principles?

**Discussion** – As stated above, examples are easily available everywhere on earth, especially for any object to be proved, it is easy to find an example that is convincing to the intellect. It is not difficult to find an example that is suitable and consistent with one's own objective. Then, even if it does not convince the intellect, even if it cannot be accepted as logic! No matter what, it is created to force, to pull, to fit the mold of one's own belief! Therefore, where such an example is the main thing, where one relies entirely on such an example, where one's airy edifice stands on such a hollow pillar, how can such logic be refuted by its own principles? Who can refute it? Nothing.

**Explanation:**

* **Daṣṭāntamātra:** Only examples, convincing to the intellect, are easily available everywhere in the world.
* **Kṣitau:** On earth.
* **Etatpradhāna:** This logic, which is based on examples.
* **Svanyātyāpodyate:** Can be refuted by its own principles.

The meaning is that this logic, which is based on examples, cannot be refuted by its own principles because examples are easily available everywhere on earth.

Yagdristi Samuchaya
Perhaps someone will say that this argument is flawed by monstrous imagination, etc. For example, imagining the burning nature of water in a fire is monstrous imagination, a very heavy imagination, it is not acceptable; therefore, it is a flaw. If someone says so, the answer is that there is no monstrous imagination, etc., in the denial of the nature proved by logic, because even with thousands of imaginations, it is not possible to imagine the nature otherwise. Therefore, it should be understood that even with a small imagination, it is not possible to imagine a change in nature. Even if it is monstrous, it is a flaw if it is not true; and if it is true, it is blameless even because of monstrousness. The meaning is that whether it is monstrous imagination or small imagination, it does not flaw the argument in any way; therefore, it is certain that this argument based on examples should be abandoned.
Monstrous imagination is not a flaw
Here the example says—
"The example of the two moons and dream knowledge arises from strength.
Otherwise, it proves the independence of all knowledge." 96
Ah—Just as these arguments arising from the examples of the two moons and dream knowledge, proving the independence of all knowledge, how can they be flawed?
Discussion
Above, the argument was said to be based on examples, and it was said that such an argument based on examples can be flawed. To show this clearly, an example is presented here: The moon is one, yet it appears to be two to a squinting eye. A dream is false—it is wrong, yet knowledge of it—awareness of it—occurs. Thus, knowledge of the moon, as well as dream knowledge, is actually false, wrong.

**Dimaatrushti:**  Such a vicious argument!
(343)
It is baseless, without support, and unfounded. With the strength of this example, someone might argue that just as this knowledge is baseless and false, so too are all other knowledge, like mirage, baseless and false. The water in a mirage is baseless, not real, but appears as a false illusion, so all knowledge is baseless and false. If someone argues in this way, using the example to discredit all knowledge, claiming it is baseless, unsupported, and unfounded, how can it be refuted? Nothing. This argument cannot be refuted, this is just an example; therefore, what wise person would rely on such an argument that leads astray, drives one mad, and leads one down the wrong path?
*
And it is said that it does not lead to the truth:
सर्व सर्वत्र चाप्नोति यदस्मादसमञ्जसम् । प्रतीतिबाधितं लोके तदनेन न किंचन ॥ ९७ ॥
From this, everything is obtained everywhere, which is illogical. In the world, that which is contradicted by perception, nothing is obtained from it, 97.
Meaning: Because this argument leads to everything everywhere, which is illogical (unreasonable) and contradicted by perception in the world, therefore, nothing is obtained from this argument, it has no purpose.
It is so.
Analysis
This
And thus, this argument does not lead to any kind of truth, because this argument leads to everything everywhere, anything can be achieved anywhere. By discrediting a particular example, a particular point is proven, and then this argument is applied everywhere! One stick is used to beat everyone! This is an extreme generalization, illogical, unreasonable, and inappropriate. Moreover, this argument is also contradicted by perception in the world.
Vicious argument
Commentary: Sarve-sarva, the goal is to achieve everything without exception, sarvatra 2-sarvatra, moreover, it is obtained in everything everywhere, chachasmāt—if this argument, asamangahram-illogical, (ayathāy),—due to extreme generalization. Pratitiāshit sra-in the world, that which is contradicted by perception, such, from the mere strength of such an example, tanen na chin-therefore, from this-this opportunity, nothing is obtained, (it has no purpose).

(344)
A collection of web-duṣṭi arises, meaning that it does not generate perception or certainty in the people. An argument proven by logic is not accepted by people. Because it contains nothing but examples, it has no other merit. Thus, such a worthless, trivial argument is of no use, it has no value. Therefore, such an argument, influenced by ambiguous public perception, is bound!
“Tată paryāsisa%ālā
Atīndriyārthasiddhaārtha nivāroḍha kuṛi I dvā. ḍhā, 23-2. Therefore, the one who is inquisitive about the true essence, the soul who is a seeker of truth, never even considers any kind of argument, that is the meaning. Every seeker should keep this concise statement of the supreme soul-experiencer, Śrīmad Rājacandraji, in their heart forever -
“Leave the philosophy, its attachment and its variations;
He who asks for this will achieve it, his birth is insignificant.” - Śrī Ātmasiddhi
The essence of the criticism of logic and this statement, as if echoing, reverberating, the great scholar Mahārṣi Haribhadrasuriji has emphasized the abandonment of this illogical planet, the logic, and has strongly prohibited all kinds of attachment and aversion. Because, criticizing this illogical planet, he has clearly shown that this logic, (1) is a color to knowledge, (2) is a hindrance to peace - self-peace, (3) is a destroyer of faith, (4) generates false pride, and (5) thus, it is a destroyer of the mind, an enemy of the ultimate goal, therefore, it is not appropriate for the seeker to be attached to it. (6) It is associated with all kinds of ignorance, and it is this logic that plans and arranges it, so what is the use of it? (7) All this logic is a species, meaning it is full of pollution, it is influenced by perception and results. Does an elephant kill the one who is far away or the one who is near? Like the Vedic arguments. (8) Moreover, this logic ultimately has an answer, “nature”. And this nature is not perceived from the essence, because it is perceived differently from the other. For example, fire wets, water burns, etc. (9) Thus, everywhere, examples are available that are influenced by public perception, then who can consider such an example-based logic? For example, the logic that arises from the strength of the example of two moons and self-knowledge proves the independence of all knowledge! (10) Thus, everything influenced by public perception is obtained everywhere from such ambiguous logic. Anything can be proven by logic, anywhere, in a haphazard way! Then what is the use of such evil, wicked logic?

##  Dimādr̥ṣṭi: A subject beyond the scope of sensory perception or dry logic (345)

6
Therefore, it is appropriate for a noble-minded seeker of liberation to abandon such fallacious arguments and attachments like straw. And whoever does so, does not abandon the auspicious Lakshmi of virtue, like a virtuous, noble woman. And such evil, harmful, and false fallacious arguments, which are contrary to the right view, are automatically avoided when the true object of knowledge is realized in this view. Thus ends the section on the condemnation of fallacious arguments.

##  A means to attain the knowledge of the transcendental

And here, it is said:

"For the sake of attaining the knowledge of the transcendental, the efforts of those who act wisely are made. But dry logic is not the means to attain it anywhere." (98)

The efforts of those who are wise and discerning are made for the sake of attaining the knowledge of the transcendental. Dharma, the soul, etc., are transcendental objects, meaning they are beyond the reach of the senses and cannot be known through sensory perception. There is no "go-char" (means of access) for them, meaning there is no movement or interaction of the senses. What is the true nature of such transcendental objects, like dharma and the soul, which are beyond sensory perception? To know, understand, and realize them, discerning and wise men are constantly striving.

##  Interpretation

The meaning is that the efforts of those who act wisely are made for the sake of attaining the knowledge of the transcendental, like dharma, etc. Dry logic, which is based on reasoning and argumentation, is not the means to attain this knowledge.

"Knowing this, the noble-minded person abandons false attachments like straw. He does not abandon the auspicious Lakshmi of virtue, like a virtuous, noble woman." - Shri Adhyatma Sara.

(346)
The Yoga Dasimuccaya states that when one contemplates the nature of the senses, one gains a deeper understanding of the transcendental nature of the soul, dharma, and other principles. This is how:

“Indriya” means that which is related to Indra. Indra is the soul, the master of the senses. Or, that which is all-powerful in its own specific field, like Indra, is an indriya. Nothing else operates in its field, and the indriya has no control over the field of another. The soul’s power over the senses is limited to their respective fields. For example, the eye can only see, the ear can only hear. The eye cannot hear, nor can the ear see. Thus, the power of each indriya is limited to its own small field, like a small king in his own small kingdom. That which is beyond the power of all the senses, that which is the master of the senses, is known as the “soul.”

Some may doubt this, saying, “There is no such thing as a soul, because it is not visible, it cannot be seen, it has no form, and it cannot be experienced in any other way. Therefore, there is no such thing as the soul. Or, the body is the soul, or the senses and breath are the soul. To believe that the soul is separate is a delusion, because there is no evidence for it. Moreover, if there is a soul, why can’t we perceive it? If it exists, it should be perceivable like a pot or a cloth. Therefore, there is no such thing as a soul, and the path to liberation is also a delusion.”

“It is not visible, it has no form, and it cannot be experienced in any other way. Therefore, there is no such thing as the soul. Or, the body is the soul, or the senses and breath are the soul. To believe that the soul is separate is a delusion, because there is no evidence for it. Moreover, if there is a soul, why can’t we perceive it? If it exists, it should be perceivable like a pot or a cloth. Therefore, there is no such thing as a soul, and the path to liberation is also a delusion.”

Srimad Rajchandraji’s Sri Atmasiddhi explains how such arguments from materialists and skeptics are flawed. This can be easily understood from the nature of the senses described above. Because even the sense of sight… 

Page #423:
---------------------------
The soul is **dipraatrusti**, **aatmaadhh**, **ateendriya**, and **aagamgochar** (347). How can the eye see the form of the soul, which is beyond the reach of the senses? The soul is the **akhaadhya anubhav** (unperceivable experience) that remains beyond the reach of the senses. Each sense has knowledge only of its own object, but the soul is aware of the objects of all five senses. The body does not know the soul, nor do the senses or the breath. But it is by the power of the soul itself that the body, senses, and breath perform their respective functions. The soul is the **yatravahak** (driver) that drives all of them. Thus, in all states, the soul is always distinct, always separate, always manifest and luminous. This is its eternal mark, its identity. Due to **dehaadhyaas** (identification with the body), the soul appears to be the same as the body, but it is different from the body in its manifest characteristics, just as the sword is different from its scabbard.

“The seer is different from the sight, the knower is different from the form. The unperceivable experience that remains is the form of the soul. Each sense has knowledge only of its own object, but the soul is aware of the objects of all five senses. The body does not know the soul, nor do the senses or the breath. It is by the power of the soul itself that they perform their respective functions. In all states, the soul is always distinct, always separate, always manifest and luminous. This is its eternal mark, its identity. Due to identification with the body, the soul appears to be the same as the body, but it is different from the body in its manifest characteristics, just as the sword is different from its scabbard.”

(Ju) Thus, the **ateendriya** (beyond the senses) nature of the soul and other such concepts is proven by **Shrimad Rajchandra** in his **Shri Aatmasiddhi Shastra**. And this **ateendriya** object is not even the subject of dry logic. Dry, dull, and **vit'daavaad** (skeptical) logic can never prove the **ateendriya** truth. Therefore, what wise soul would serve such dry logic, which is useless, does not lead to the desired result, and instead harms the soul, causing **vyaameh** (confusion)? What wise and discerning soul would even touch it from afar?

The object of the aagama is the ateeindriya artha, and it is through the aagama that it is known. This is evident from the fact that the aagama predicts events like eclipses of the sun and moon, which are then observed to occur as predicted. 99
Yogashti Samuchaya
Meaning: However, the ateeindriya artha, or the knowledge of the ateeindriya artha, is obtained through the aagama, which is evident from the fact that the aagama predicts events like eclipses of the sun and moon, which are then observed to occur as predicted.
Commentary:
The aagama is the only source of knowledge about the ateeindriya artha. This is because the aagama provides knowledge about such subjects. For example, the aagama predicts that an eclipse of the moon or sun will occur on a particular day and time. And, as predicted by the aagama, the eclipse is observed to occur at the same time. Thus, the aagama's predictions are confirmed by observation. This example proves that the ateeindriya artha is the subject matter of the aagama. Although eclipses are considered to be laukik artha, they are used here as an example of the ateeindriya artha.
The ateeindriya artha is not accessible to the senses, and it is only through the aagama that it can be known. This is because the aagama is the only source of knowledge about the ateeindriya artha.

**Divya Drishti:** A yogi who is **Ati-indriya** (possessing extra-sensory perception) and **Sat-shraddha** (possessing true faith) knows (349) and has experienced the true nature of the self, becoming the very embodiment of the "**Prabhu**" (Lord). They have revealed this self-realization truthfully, just as they have seen it. Therefore, such a **Atma-drishta** (self-realized) individual, a **Nirdosh** (blameless) **Atma-anubhavi** (experiencer of the self), a **Prapt** (attained) **Purush** (man), is the ultimate authority, a true friend, and worthy of complete trust. Just as in worldly affairs, one trusts a truthful and honest person without hesitation, so too in the realm of **Parmarth** (ultimate truth), one should trust such a true and honest **Sapurush** (perfect man) without hesitation, and "**Tahatti**" (accept their words). 

**Shreemad Rajchandraji** has said:

"Whose word should be considered true to attain the ultimate?
Believe the words of a blameless man who has experienced it." - **Meksha Mala, Path 67**

And this is also true for those who are free from **Desha** (faults) and **Avaran** (veils). Those whose **Rag-Dvesha-Mahaadi** (attachment, aversion, and other vices) and **Jnana-Darshan** (knowledge and perception) veils have been removed are truly worthy of being considered "**Apt**" (worthy).

Because if there are veils on knowledge, then due to incomplete knowledge, their words may be false, and one cannot trust them. And if there are **Rag-Dvesha-Mahaadi** (attachment, aversion, and other vices), then there is a chance of speaking falsehood, and again, one cannot trust them. But if there is **Niravaran** (veil-less) knowledge and **Rag-Dvesha-Rahit** (free from attachment and aversion) - **Nirdosh** (blameless) nature, then their words are completely true and trustworthy. Therefore, whoever is **Sarvajña** (omniscient) and **Vitrag** (free from attachment), they are **Apt** (worthy), and their words are **Apt** (worthy), meaning they are the ultimate authority and completely trustworthy. And such **Apt-Vachan** (worthy words) are the **Agam** (scripture) or the trustworthy scripture.

In conclusion, it is said:

**एतत्प्रधानः सच्छ्राद्धः शीलवान् योगतत्परः । जानात्यतीन्द्रियानर्था स्तथा चाह महामतिः ॥ १०॥**

**Vritti:** **Itat-pradhan** - This **Agam-pradhan** (scripture-based), **Sad-shraddha** - **Sat-shraddha** (possessing true faith), **Shraddhavant** (faithful), **Prajn** (wise), **Shravan** - **Shilavan** (virtuous), **Par-droh** (betrayal) - **Virati-man** (free from), **Yog-tatva** - **Tat-par** (devoted to yoga). Always engaged in it, such a person knows **Ati-indriya** (extra-sensory) **Artha** (meaning), like Dharma (righteousness), and **Tatha** - **Maha-matti** (thus, the great sage) - **Patanjali** has said:

**"दोषावरणया निनिःशेषास्त्यतिशायनात् ।
जाथिथा हेतूओ वक्रीआन्तर्मक्षचः ”** - **Shree Samantabhadracharya-krit Asammi-Mansa**

The collection of Gadasti, primarily based on scriptures, describes a person who is devoted to truth, righteous, and disciplined.
Meaning: This person, who is devoted to scriptures, righteous, and disciplined, knows the subtle meanings beyond the senses. And in this way, the great sage (Patanjali) has said -
Analysis: This means that the person who considers scriptures as the primary source of knowledge, is righteous, disciplined, and devoted to yoga, knows the subtle meanings beyond the senses. And in this way, the great sage Patanjali has also said. In the previous section, the scriptures were established as the authoritative source of knowledge about the subtle meanings beyond the senses, through the example of perception. Such a person who considers scriptures as the primary source of knowledge, is called a righteous person. Because he is devoted to the truth, has unwavering faith and firm belief in the scriptures, and always strives to follow the teachings of righteous people. Thus, a seeker who desires self-liberation should first become devoted to the scriptures, because "righteousness comes from the scriptures and austerity comes from the scriptures" - this is the teaching of the scriptures. Without the guidance of a righteous person, the actions of a being, such as charity, austerity, and discipline, become obstacles and lead to further rebirth. Therefore, the sage has placed the quality of devotion to the scriptures as the most important. Only a person who is devoted to the scriptures can become righteous.
"The devotee who is absorbed in the Lord, has attained the state of Devchandra." "He should color his mind with devotion and quickly attain the state of Devchandra." - Shri Devchandraji.
Such a righteous person then strives to follow the scriptures to the best of his ability. And the main teaching of the scriptures is to practice "discipline." "Discipline" means to remain in one's own nature; by engaging in sexual misconduct, one violates discipline. Therefore, the main teaching of the scriptures is to practice "discipline" by remaining in one's own nature and not engaging in sexual misconduct. And for the practice of such discipline, the five vows of non-violence, truthfulness, etc. are paramount.

##  Diimadrushti: The Threefold Remedy of Your Masina's Arrival

(351)

The arrival of your Masina is a threefold remedy, therefore, following its instructions is a scriptural command. By following this command, the devout seeker, with all their might, becomes dedicated to the observance of ahimsa, satya, and other virtues. They strive to remain in their true nature, abandoning all external influences and distractions. Thus, they become virtuous.

And so, the devout and virtuous seeker, who is also restrained, becomes eligible for the path of liberation and becomes dedicated to it. They strive to achieve the union of their true nature with the divine. As they become dedicated to this path, they attain divine knowledge through the grace of the liberated ones, and gain knowledge of the transcendental realms.

What is it? It is this:

"Through scripture, through inference, and through the practice of yoga, one attains the highest truth by cultivating wisdom in these three ways." (101)

**Explanation:**

Muni Patanjali says that the highest truth is attained by cultivating wisdom in three ways: (1) through scripture, (2) through inference, and (3) through the practice of yoga. By applying wisdom to scripture, by aligning oneself with the words of the enlightened ones, one attains the highest truth. Inference is the knowledge of the cause from the effect, and by applying wisdom to this, one attains the highest truth. Similarly, the practice of yoga, which is the practice of prescribed rituals, also leads to the attainment of the highest truth when wisdom is applied to it. Thus, in these three ways, through scripture, inference, and the practice of yoga, one attains the highest truth by applying wisdom to them in this order.

**Commentary:**

"Through scripture" - through scripture that is characterized by the words of the enlightened ones. "Through inference" - through inference that is the knowledge of the cause from the effect. "Through the practice of yoga" - through the practice of yoga that is the practice of prescribed rituals. "In these three ways" - because otherwise, the practice would be ineffective. "The highest truth" - the highest truth is attained by the elimination of karmic impurities, which leads to the realization of the true nature of reality.

Yoga-drishti samuccaya attains the supreme principle, that is, by the cessation of sin and doubt, the supreme principle is attained by distinguishing between the created and the uncreated. In another way, the attainment of the principle does not happen by activity.
1. Here, the first means of attaining the principle is Agama, because Agama is the word of the self-realized person who has seen the principle directly. By going to the nectar of the words of such a supremely wise and principle-knowing person, that is, by worshipping the words of a virtuous person with understanding and understanding, the attainment of the supreme principle is sure to happen.
2. The second means of attaining the principle is Anumana, that is, the reasoning that is full of logic. In this reasoning, by doing the experiment of knowledge, that is, by reasoning with agreement, the principle is examined in detail, it is examined in detail, and by passing the test of reasoning, the principle becomes extremely firm, and the principle is determined by the appropriate resolution of the reasoning of agreement. But this reasoning must be full of logic. Just as the justice of justice is impartial, non-aggressive, and neutral, so the examiner of agreement must impartially, non-aggressively, and neutrally examine the principle, and accept the logical side with an open mind, as the author of this Yoga-drishti samuccaya scripture, Maharshi Hari Bhadrasuriji, has shown and done; or as Shrimad Rajchandraji has demonstrated in the Maha Darshan Prabhavak Granth called Meksha Mala.
“Pakshapato na ke vire: piraripu.
Guvatam avanam ya ta tha: paripradda” Shri Haribhadracharyaji. Also, this reasoning should not be contrary to Agama, but should be non-contrary, it should be in accordance with Agama. Because Agama is the word of the directly principle-knowing person, its place is much higher than reasoning. Therefore, there is no obstacle in establishing the principle of Agama with good reasoning, but there is definitely an obstacle in uplifting it. And that is why Agama is placed first here.
3. And the third means of attaining the principle is the interest of the four practices. By studying the yoga practice prescribed in the true scriptures with interest, the supreme principle is attained. The yoga practice, that is, the practice of Dharma, which is shown in the scriptures, by taking interest in studying it again and again, the soul's maturity becomes pure, and the knowledge becomes pure, so the miracle of the principle shines in it. Here, the word 'rasa' indicates the feeling of being one-minded and absorbed in yoga practice. The place of this practice here is... 

Page #429:
---------------------------
**The Divine Perspective**

There is no difference in the Truth, yet there is love for the devotees!

(353) The third is placed, the reason for this is that this practice should be according to the instructions of the scriptures, and it should be in accordance with the scriptures, and it should be done with the help of the scriptures, not according to one's own will.

Thus, in the attainment of Truth, these three remedies have the aforementioned precedence. The first place is of the scriptures, then of inference, and then of practice, because the latter is only beautiful if the former is in place. Therefore, the seeker should accept the scriptures with firm faith, examine them with skill, understand them properly with intelligence, and then practice them with enthusiasm, then he will surely attain the highest Truth, that is the meaning. First faith, then intelligence, and then enthusiastic activity, when these three are present in this order, then the attainment of the work of Truth is achieved.

**The Omniscient Truth**

This means that there are many omniscient beings, but they are not different in their views from the Truth. The difference is in the delusion of those who are not liberated, and therefore they take refuge in that difference. (102)

**Commentary**

* From the Truth, from the ultimate reality, there are no different opinions. There are many omniscient beings, but they are not different in their views. The difference is in the delusion of those who are not liberated, and therefore they take refuge in that difference.

* This description of the Divine Perspective is very long, with many heart-touching scholarly discussions. For the sake of clarity and ease of reading, I have used the main chapters and their sub-chapters in this daily practice.

Above, the priority of the Agama or scripture and its faith is emphasized. After that, which scripture should one have faith in? Because there are differences in everything, it is natural to ask this question. The answer is given here that one should look at the scripture from the perspective of the Tattva, not from the perspective of Dharmavad. There is no difference in the scripture because there is no difference in its Shasta. But the school-minded people become proud of their differences, and this is because of the differences in the country, according to their Nay. Thus, the creators of these Dharma-Shastras, who are all-knowing and many all-knowing, are not different in opinion when considered from the perspective of Tattva - the ultimate truth. There is no difference of opinion among them, nor is there any difference of opinion among their devotees. Therefore, there is no room for any kind of difference of opinion among all those who worship them, who are all-knowing devotees, and who are faithful and righteous. However, some of those who are extremely devoted to the all-knowing, who imagine differences among them, who believe in differences and separation, are only ignorant, because they are blinded by their excessive devotion and faith, and in their religious zeal, they forget their wisdom and imagine things that are not true. But in reality, all the infinite all-knowing ones are one and the same. Therefore, to imagine differences among them is only a delusion, only a delusion. Therefore, since there is no difference in the all-knowing ones who are worthy of worship, there is no difference among the all-knowing devotees who worship them.
It is human nature, a human weakness, to consider the father's worthy and revered person, the all-knowing one, as superior. Therefore, the father wants to prove that the all-knowing one he believes in is superior to all others, and he is easily tempted to imagine differences, and blinded by his attachment to his favorite deity, he insists on imagining differences. From this attachment, excessive enthusiasm and excessive devotion lead to blind religious zeal among the overly enthusiastic devotees; and thus, small quarrels arise in the name of religion. Thus, this evil tradition of division becomes the root. “Abhinandan Jin Darishan Tarsie, Darishanu Durlabh Dev; Mat Mat Bhede Re Je Jai Poochie, Sau Thape Ahmev.” – Shri Anandghanji.

## Diimadrushti: The Ultimate Omniscient, Though Different in Person, is One and the Same

(355) How? It is said -

"Whoever is called omniscient, is indeed ultimate. He is one and the same everywhere, despite differences in person." (103)

**Meaning:** Whoever is called "omniscient" and is truly ultimate, is one and the same everywhere, despite differences in person.

**Commentary:**

It was stated above that there is no difference among omniscients. How is this so? This is clarified here - "Whoever is called omniscient" and is truly ultimate, is one and the same everywhere, despite differences in person. Even though the true ultimate omniscient may be called by different names like Ahanta, Jin, Buddha, Shiva, Sarvagna Abheda Shankar, etc., due to differences in person, in essence, they are one and the same. Even though they may be different in person, like Rishabha Jin, etc., they are one and the same in essence, as they share the common characteristic of ultimate omniscience. There is no room for difference in this.

"The liberated, the Buddha, and even Ahanta, when endowed with divine power, are all one and the same." - Shri Haribhadrasuriji's Shri Yogabindu.

"Shiva, Shankar, Jagadishwaru, Chidananda Bhagavan...Lalana, Jin Ariha Tirthankaru, all three are the same." - Shri Anandghanaji.

No matter what the name or the person, if the true ultimate reality is the same, then the infinite omniscients are also one form. Thus, the infinite Kevaljnas are also...

**Kritti:**

* **Sarvagna Name:** - Whoever is called omniscient, like Ahanta, etc., is ultimate.
* **Di-Paramarthik:** - He is truly ultimate.
* **Sarvatra:** - He is one and the same everywhere.
* **Vyakti Bhed Chata:** - Despite differences in person.
* **Tattva Thi:** - In essence.
* **Rishabha Adhirup Vyakti Bhed Chata:** - Despite differences in person, like Rishabha, etc.

The collection of Gadasti is not different from Kevaljnana, because the Kevaljnani is omniscient and knows everything. In his countless regional self-fields, there is an infinite place for Paryaya, and his complete and perfect knowledge power is fully manifested, so he knows everything specifically, all the Prameyapramanas are his Kevaljnana.
“The field is countless regions, infinite Paryaya are inserted; the knowing power is complete, therefore he knows everything specifically...
Your name is Jiganda, my mind is filled with it. All Prameyapramanas, as Kevaljnana is attained, it is the same as Kevaljnana, as the Muni knows... Jiganda.”
–Shri Devchandraji.
Therefore, the acceptance of him, which is general;
All of them are dependent on him, that is the ultimate path of logic, 14.
Meaning – Therefore, the acceptance of the main omniscient, which is general, all of them are dependent on him, that is the ultimate path of logic.
Discussion – Thus, even though there are individual differences, the omniscient is one, therefore, all those who accept this omniscient generally, are all dependent on him, that is the ultimate path of logic. Because, just as the human characteristics are in whomsoever, the main omniscient is accepted as “human” generally, that is the method of logic of the non-dualistic approach; similarly, the characteristics of the omniscient are in whomsoever, he is accepted as “omniscient” generally, that is the method of logic. And thus, all the different thinkers and philosophers who accept the omniscient generally, have faith in him, all of them are dependent on the main, transcendental, that is – acceptance, therefore, his, of the omniscient, generally,
of those, how many, of other countries, also, all of them,
that main omniscient, are dependent, that is the ultimate path of logic, – without it, his acceptance is not proven.

##  Diimadrushti: The Unity of the Ordinary and the Omniscient

(357) It is logically proven that one recognizes and believes in only one Omniscient. Therefore, even those who follow different philosophies, all recognize the same Omniscient, the same unified form. Thus, there cannot be any difference among the devotees who worship the Omniscient.

**Verse 105:**

"The special, however, is not known by all those who are not omniscient. No one attains Him, because He is not fully known by all."

**Explanation:**

The above discussion established the unity of the ordinary and the Omniscient. Now, someone might argue that there is a difference in the special. The answer to this is that the special difference in the Omniscient cannot be fully known by all those who are not omniscient. Because they themselves are not omniscient, they cannot fully perceive the Omniscient. How can they know the special, the difference, in the Omniscient? Even if they have a general understanding, they cannot progress in their knowledge of the special. Thus, it is impossible for all those who are not omniscient to fully understand the special form of the Omniscient. Because the complete can understand the complete, but how can the incomplete understand the complete?

Therefore, any difference imagined about the Omniscient based on such understanding is meaningless. For example, the Keshava people call Him eternal and omnipresent, while others call Him temporal and not omnipresent. The Buddhists call Him momentary, and so on. All these differences are meaningless because:

1. The special knowledge, the complete knowledge of all aspects, cannot be attained by those who are not omniscient.
2. Due to the differences in their philosophies, there is often conflict.

**Commentary:**

"The special, however, is not known by all those who are not omniscient. No one attains Him, because He is not fully known by all."

This means that even if someone has a general understanding of the Omniscient, they cannot fully comprehend the special aspects of the Omniscient. This is because they are not omniscient themselves. Therefore, no one who is not omniscient can truly attain the Omniscient.

Gadashtisamuchya means that contradictory arguments based on conjecture refute each other. Sankhya refutes Shaiva and Bauddha, and Bauddha refutes Sankhya and Shaiva. This cycle of refutation continues, and the question remains unresolved, leaving the donkey in the well! (3) And there is no difference between the feeling and the fruit. That is, there is no difference in the fruit from the ultimate truth. (4) Because whatever the specific form of the omniscient may be, the fruit of the worship of the omniscient, which is in the form of qualities, is the same, and it is the ultimate fruit in the form of liberation. Therefore, since the fruitfulness is only due to the respect for the omniscient God, whoever worships him with true feeling will receive that fruit. So what is the point of the false debate about the specific form of the omniscient? What is the point of this useless fight?
Thus, since the omniscient is manifested and attained through the specific, no one is truly omniscient. Then, who can see or know that there is a difference in the omniscient? Therefore, accepting the unity that is proven, and leaving the talk of the specific, is the most appropriate and beneficial for all beings, and it is what the liberated yogis should do from the ultimate truth, from the soul.
Therefore, even from the general point of view, he who accepts him as the omniscient, without any hypocrisy, is equal to him in that respect, for the wise. (106)
Meaning: Therefore, even from the general point of view, whoever truly accepts this omniscient, is equal to him in that respect, for the wise.
Commentary: Therefore, even from the general point of view, whoever accepts this omniscient, whoever accepts him, is equal to him in that respect, for the wise.

**Deemadrushti: All devotees who serve the omniscient are one and the same.**

(359) To the extent of their belief, all devotees are the same as the omniscient. That is, they are truly, sincerely, and wholeheartedly dedicated to following the omniscient's commands. They are equal to the wise and learned in their understanding and acceptance of the omniscient's teachings, regardless of their religion, sect, or philosophy. To believe in the omniscient means to be sincerely and wholeheartedly dedicated to following their commands. This is clearly stated because simply saying that you believe in the omniscient but not following their commands is like mocking or making fun of their teachings. It is like saying, "I am your servant, but I will not do what you say!" Therefore, the best way to worship the omniscient is to always be dedicated to following their commands regarding ahimsa, satya, and other principles.

In this regard, Shri Haribhadrasuriji has said in the Ashtak:

"Good service is good, it does not cause any harm;
Being present and obedient, the Lord is easily pleased.
Good service to the Jina, with a pure mind." - Shri Devchandraji

The meaning is that anyone who accepts the omniscient principle and is sincerely and wholeheartedly dedicated to following their commands is equal to the omniscient to the extent of their belief. Whether they are Jain or non-Jain, Buddhist or Brahmin, Shaiva or Vaishnava, Sankhya or Nyaya, Vedanta or Siddhanta, Islamic or Christian, regardless of their religion or sect, if they believe in the omniscient, they are one and the same. Thus, the common belief in the omniscient is a unique meeting point for all religions in the world. Therefore, there is no difference between devotees who serve the omniscient, who is one and the same.

This same meaning is expressed in the following verses:

"Those who worship the omniscient are truly equal.
They are fruitful in their actions, according to their ability and rules."

"By relying on the omniscient's teachings, with a pure mind,
All yogis are equal, without any self-interest."

Yoga-Dristi-Samuccaya

Just as many people are dependent on one king, even though they are different in terms of nearness and distance, they are all his servants. 107

Meaning - Just as there are many dependents of a king, but despite the difference in nearness and distance, they are all his servants;

The above discussion has been supported by a well-known example, which shows the oneness of all omniscient devotees. Just as there is a king, and there are many men who serve him, some of these dependents are close to the king, some are far away, some are ministers, some are advisors, some are soldiers, some are clerks, some are attendants, etc. There is a difference in rank according to the appointment of these men. But all these men who are dependents of the king are servants of the same king. There is no difference in their servitude. Some may have a higher position, some may have a lower position, but all of them are counted among the servants - the servants. They are all called government servants as one class.

The Dristika people say - All those who believe in the omniscient principle are to be known as omniscient, even though they are different in their conduct. 108

Re-explanation - Just as there are many dependents of a king, even though they are different in terms of nearness and distance, they are all his servants. In the same way, all those who believe in the omniscient principle, even though they are different in their conduct, are to be known as omniscient.

##  **Diimadrusti: All are One in the All-Knowing**

(361) All are All-Knowing due to the oneness of the All-Knowing principle;
Though their practices differ, they all know the All-Knowing principle. 108 Meaning - Due to the oneness of the All-Knowing principle, all All-Knowing ones, though they reside in different practices, are known to be followers of the All-Knowing principle.

**Discussion**

As per the above mentioned principle, i.e. according to the above mentioned example, just like many men residing under the patronage of a king, all All-Knowing ones are those who go towards - move towards - the All-Knowing principle; because the All-Knowing principle is one, as mentioned above. Thus, all are All-Knowing. Then, even if those All-Knowing ones are situated in different practices due to different types of rights, they are known to be followers of the All-Knowing principle. The meaning is - just as there are many men under the patronage of a king, who have different rights, big and small, according to their own merit, who hold high and low positions, but they are all considered to be the king's subjects, there is no difference in their servitude; similarly, all those who take refuge in the Lord, who respect and worship all, whether Jain or non-Jain, all All-Knowing ones are those who move towards that one All-Knowing principle, they are the subjects, servants, and devotees of the All-Knowing. Then, even if those who accept the All-Knowing principle are Jain or Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava, Parsi or Christian, and even if they conduct themselves in different practices due to different rights according to their own merit, whether they are of high status or low status, whether they are of superior or inferior category, whatever they may be, they are all worshippers, devotees, and servants of the one and only worshipable All-Knowing, there is no difference in their servitude, they are all servants of the All-Knowing Lord.

Are these true servants and devotees of the All-Knowing also called 'kan'? This has been clarified above, and here it has been further strengthened by the example of the king's servants. Even in common social interactions, a servant should always be ready to obey the king's orders, this is the way of a servant and devotee, then how much more should a true servant be ready to obey the orders of the All-Knowing Lord, it can be easily understood. And a true servant and devotee who serves and worships should not expect any reward for their service, and that is the true devotion, not that which expects something in return, that is not devotion, but like a paid job! 

Page #438:
---------------------------
(362)
Gadashtisamuchchay "Service is the essence of the Jina's mind, but do not ask for anything in return, brother! By asking for the fruits of your efforts, you lose the spirit of service... Service. Devotion is not a contract, where service is exchanged for rewards; a true servant, filled with devotion, dances to the tune of his master... Service." - Shri Devchandraji.
And those who are true servants and devotees of this omniscient God, being of the same Dharma, are all righteous. Therefore, they should have the utmost affection for each other, the utmost love, and the feeling of Universal Brotherhood should be firmly developed, as is evident from the above. And if this is the case, then where is there any room for any kind of superiority, envy, or intolerance towards each other?
In conclusion, it is said:
न भेद एव तत्त्वेन सर्वज्ञानां महात्मनाम् । तथा नामादिभेदेऽपि भाव्यमेतन्महात्मभिः ॥ १०९ ॥ Mahatmas are all one in essence,
Even though there may be differences in names, etc., this should be the feeling of the Mahatmas. 109, Meaning - Mahatmas are all one in essence - in the same way, even though there may be differences in names, etc., this should be the feeling of the Mahatmas.

Kanan says Mahadevri." Shri Anandghanji.

Deepradrushti: Despite differences in names and other attributes, all are ultimately non-dual in essence.
(363) Even though there may be differences in names and other attributes, in essence, there is no difference whatsoever. Thus, it is appropriate for the great souls to contemplate with wisdom, understanding, and unwavering faith, considering the essence as the primary focus.
Because, when contemplating from the perspective of ultimate reality, it is clear to the wise that there is no possibility of any kind of difference in the true essence of all beings. The definition of "He who knows all is omniscient" proves this logically. Even though there may be differences in names, the omniscient one is given different names based on different beliefs, sects, etc., and his form is described differently, his glory is sung differently, and his character is narrated differently, but there is no difference in his all-encompassing essence. Some call him Jin, some Shiva, some Buddha, some Ahanta, some Vishnu, some Brahma, some Ishwar, some Khuda, some Ram, some Rehman, some Paramatma, some Almighty God, etc., whatever the name of their beloved deity, they all worship the same one, but there is no difference in meaning due to the difference in names. Just as the Ganga River is called Suranadhi, Bhagirathi, Vipathga, Mandakini, etc., but the Ganga River is one and the same, there is no change in it, similarly, even though different names are given to the one essence of all, there is no change in its essential unity. Omniscience is one and indivisible from the ultimate perspective, and it is appropriate for the wise to contemplate with wisdom, understanding, and unwavering faith, and to contemplate again and again.
And the various names given to this one essence of omniscience are also indicative of its various qualities, and are meaningful in describing its unparalleled and inconceivable glory from different perspectives. For example, "Ahan" means worthy of worship, worthy of worship, worthy of worship by the world. By destroying the enemy of karma, he is "Jin-Vitrag". By his divine nature, he is "Mahadeva". By his unwavering nature and his ability to bring happiness, that is, by his nature as the savior of the three worlds, he is "Shankar". By his knowledge of Brahma, by his knowledge of the self, he is "Brahma". By removing suffering, he is Hari. He is worshipped by the wise, so he is "Buddha". By establishing the rules of the path of Shiva, he is "Vidhata". Thus, he is the manifest supreme being. Even though he has many names, he is not many in his own nature, because the one essence of infinite qualities is well-known. Therefore, the various names based on different qualities are not mutually contradictory, but are indicative of the same meaning and essence, complementing and supporting each other, and confirming the one essence.

Deeprakrut: Two types of devotion - Chitra and Achitra
(365)

Those who follow different rituals due to their own differences in rights, who cherish small types of practices, who worship the Lord in different ways according to their own high and low self-awareness, but the worshipped-adorable Lord is one, then his worshippers-adorers are also one.

Chitra Achitra Devabhakti Vibhag
Shastragal (as stated in the scriptures) says another justification:

चित्राचित्रविभागेन यच्च देवेषु वर्णिता ।
भक्तिः सद्योगशास्त्रेषु ततोऽप्येवमिदं स्थितम् ॥ ११० ॥
Chitra Achitra Vibhagena, Bhakti Deva ni je; Sag Shastra varnvi, tethi pan sthit ehu, 110,
Ah - And devotion towards the Gods, which is described in the Sag Shastras by the division of Chitra and Achitra, from that also this (what is said) is established.

Discussion
To support what was said above that the cognition is one, another scriptural justification is stated here: - It is described in the Sadvegshastra, which contemplates the spiritual subject, that there is a clear division of devotion to the Gods like Akapal, Mukta etc.: (1) Chitra means different, different types, (2) Achitra means non-different or different types. From the confirmation of this Sadshastra, the unity of the present cognition and its devotee is established.

"Nahi Sarvagna Jujuaji, Tehana Vali Das;
Bhakti Deva ni pan Kthiji, Chitra Achitra Prakash....Man॰ ” —Cha. Sajjay 4-14
⭑

This same thing is said more clearly:

Vritti: Trichitravin-Chitra-Achitra Vibhagathi - Whose characteristic is said, Yajna and which, it is forbidden towards the country, Lokapann-Mukta etc. Gods, it is described, Ktti: Bhakti, Soloshastravu-Saddeveshnashtras, in all spiritual contemplation scriptures, Tevi - because of that also, Manu Sthitam - this present is established.

## Gadashtisamuccaya

**Verse 111:**

*For those who are bound to the cycle of birth and death, devotion is directed towards the gods of this world. For those who transcend the cycle of birth and death, devotion is directed towards the ultimate truth.*

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the difference in devotion based on the seeker's path. 

* **Devotion to worldly gods:** This type of devotion is practiced by those who are still bound to the cycle of birth and death. They seek liberation through the path of worldly gods, aiming to attain a heavenly realm.
* **Devotion to the ultimate truth:** This type of devotion is practiced by those who have transcended the cycle of birth and death. They seek liberation through the path of self-realization, aiming to attain the ultimate truth.

**Commentary:**

The verse highlights the distinction between the devotion of those who are still bound to the cycle of birth and death and those who have transcended it. 

* **Worldly gods:** These are the gods of this world, such as the Lokapalas (guardians of the directions). Their devotees are those who are still bound to the cycle of birth and death and seek liberation through their path.
* **Ultimate truth:** This refers to the ultimate reality, the true nature of existence. Its devotees are those who have transcended the cycle of birth and death and seek liberation through the path of self-realization.

The verse emphasizes that the type of devotion one practices depends on their stage of spiritual development. Those who are still bound to the cycle of birth and death will naturally be drawn to worldly gods, while those who have transcended it will be drawn to the ultimate truth.

**Quote from the Bhagavad Gita:**

* "Those whose knowledge is destroyed by desires, worship other deities, seeking fulfillment through them. They are bound by their own rules and regulations." (Bhagavad Gita, 7.20)

##  Diimadrushti Sansari Devni Bhakti Chitra-Sukta ni Bhakti Achitra

(367) The motion of the soul is determined by what it worships. If it worships the worldly, it becomes worldly. If it worships the liberated, it becomes liberated. The soul can become whatever it desires to become. Just as an eel, focusing on a bee, becomes a bee, similarly, if one worships the Jina in the form of the Jina, they become a true Jina. If one worships a scavenger, they become a scavenger.  ... "Shaddarshan" Shri Anandghanji.

This is further explained by the following:

"Chitra Chadyeshhu Tadragatadanyadveshasangata. Achitra Charame Twesha Shamasaraakhileva Hi." || 112 ||

The devotion that is based on attachment and aversion is called "Chitra" (different). The devotion that is free from attachment and aversion is called "Achitra" (undifferentiated).

**Explanation:**

The two types of devotion mentioned above are explained here. The devotion towards worldly gods like Lokapala, etc., is "Chitra" (different) because it is based on attachment and aversion. This type of devotion is characterized by attachment to one's own chosen deity and aversion towards other deities. For example, a devotee of Hanuman, Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Varuna, or any other deity, due to their attachment to their chosen deity, may develop aversion towards other deities. This type of devotion is based on different deities and is characterized by attachment and aversion. It lacks tolerance and often involves the belief that one's own deity is the true one and all others are false.

**Interpretation:**

"Chitra" - This type of devotion is based on attachment and aversion towards worldly deities. It is characterized by attachment to one's own chosen deity and aversion towards other deities.

"Achitra" - This type of devotion is undifferentiated and is characterized by the absence of attachment and aversion. It is directed towards the ultimate reality, which is beyond the worldly realm.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
And the other, which is said to be the liberated principle, free from the world, the devotion towards it is achitra, that is, it is uniform, it is of one kind; because the oneness-non-duality of that principle has been proved above. The devotion of the liberated principle and this one-form principle is samsara-shama-predominant. Devotion is achitra, in it there is no raga towards one and dvesha towards the other; but there is samabhava, which is free from raga-dvesha, and the flow of akhada shanta rasa flows, so the emergence of evil emotions like dvesha-intolerance is impossible, because there is a lack of samahana here. Thus, the devotion of many such worldly gods is vichitra and the devotion of one such liberated principle is achitra.
Gods are many in the world, their devotion is vichitra;
One raga, one dvesha, one liberation is achitra...mind '—Ya. 6. Say. 4-15 ★
Here the purpose is said
संसारिणां हि देवानां यस्माच्चित्राण्यनेकधा । स्थित्यैश्वर्यप्रभावाद्यैः स्थानानि प्रतिशासनम् ॥ ११३ ॥
The place of the worldly gods, vichitra, many kinds; from the state of aisvarya, the basis of pratisasana. 113 A:—Because the place of the worldly gods is made by the state-aisvarya-influence, etc., in each shasana, there are many kinds of vichitra (different).
Discussion
It was said that the worldly gods are vichitra-of various kinds and their devotion is also vichitra, the reason for this is as follows:-The worldly gods who are in this three-fold universe, which is the upper, middle and lower world, are said to be vichitra in many ways in each shasana, that is, the worldly gods are said to be of small kinds-of various kinds. Because their state, ashva, vichitra place influence, natural form, etc., there are various differences in their vimanas, etc. For example, (1) in Hindu religion, Brahma, Vishnu,
Vritti:-Because the worldly gods-lokapala, etc., are chashma-vichitra, because they are vichitra-of many forms, nepa-of many kinds,-by what? which? For that it is said, sthira-aisvarya-mava-dhai:sthiti, aisvarya, influence, etc., by doing so, the word adde is the acceptance of the natural form, etc., sthanaani-place, vimanas, etc., vritti-shasana-pratisasana, in each shasana,-from the non-duality of the universe,

## Divine Vision: The Picture of the Deities' Abode as a Means of Attainment

(36) Mahesh, Indra, Surya, Chandra, Pavana, Agni, Varuna, etc. are considered deities. They differ in their natural form, position, opulence, influence, and other aspects, as described in the scriptures. (2) Jainism recognizes four types of worldly deities: Bhuvanapati, Vyantara, Jyotishi, and Vaimanika. They are further described in detail with various distinctions. Some have a lower position, while others have a higher one. Some possess greater opulence, while others have less. Some have a weak influence, while others are intensely radiant. Some have an attractive natural form, while others are unattractive. Thus, there are many types of deities based on different aspects of form, taste, smell, and color. (3) Buddhism, Christianity, and other religions also describe worldly deities according to their own beliefs. Thus, the abodes of worldly deities, such as Vimanas, are also depicted in various ways depending on each doctrine.

Because it is so:

"Therefore, the means of attainment for them are, by rule, indeed pictures. There is never one path for different cities." (114)

Meaning: Therefore, the means of attainment for their abodes are, by rule, different types of pictures, because there is never one path for different cities.

Discussion: Thus, the abodes of worldly deities are different and distinct. Therefore, the means of attainment for those deities' abodes are also, by rule, pictures of different types. To illustrate this, a well-known example is given here: there is never one path to go to different cities. Mumbai, Kolkata, Madras, Delhi, etc., are cities located in different directions. If one wants to go to them, the paths will also be in different directions, not one. Otherwise, the difference between those cities would be diminished.

Commentary: "Therefore" - because of that reason, "means of attainment" - the means of attainment for them, the means of attainment for the abodes of worldly deities. "By rule, indeed pictures" - by rule, they are indeed pictures. This same point is explained through a well-known example: "different cities" - different cities, "one path" - there is never one path of that type, because of the difference between them. 

Page #446:
---------------------------
(370)
Yoga Darshanamuchchaya is not like this. Just as the paths to different cities are different, so too are the means to different worldly temples different. Therefore, it is proven that the devotion to the image deity is of the image type.

## Deepraranshti: The Nature of Ishta - The Feeling of Self-Sacrifice in Yajna
And -
The Ishtapurta Karmas and the Distinction in Intention and Fruit.

**"Ishtapurta karmani loke chitraabhisandhitah | Nana phalani sarvani drishtavyaani vichakshanaih || 115 ||"**

"The karmas that are Ishtapurta are, in the world, due to different intentions (chitraabhisandhi) - due to different opinions, they have different kinds of fruits. The discerning ones should see this." (115)

**(371)**

**Explanation:**

Above, we spoke of the diversity in the place of the deity and the diversity in the means of worship. To further clarify this, another point is presented here: The Ishtapurta karmas, which are performed in the world, are also diverse in nature due to the different intentions (abhiprayabhede) and different opinions (abhisandhi-abhipray) of different beings. There are different intentions, and therefore, the fruits of these karmas are also different. The discerning ones - the wise and learned - should understand this.

The nature of Ishtapurta karmas will be explained below. The different intentions (abhiprayabhede) with which these karmas are performed lead to different fruits. This is clear to the wise. "As the intention (intention), so the fruit, as the feeling, so the accomplishment."

**The nature of Ishtapurta is explained:**

**"Rtvigbhirmantrasanskarairbrahmananan samkshatah | Antarvedyaam hi yaddattamishtam tadabhidhiyate || 116 ||"**

**Explanation:**

"Ishtapurta" - which will be explained below - is that which is given in the yajna, in the presence of Brahmanas, by the Rtvigs, using mantras and rituals. It is that which is given inside the vedi (altar), clearly and definitely. This is called "Ishta" due to the specific nature of the yajna. 

Page #448:

(

Gadastisamuccaya
Mantrasanskar performed in the presence of Brahmanas;
What is given in the Veda, that is called Ishta, 116 meaning - by the Rtvigs, through mantrasanskar, in the presence of Brahmanas, inside the Vedi, what is given, that is called 'Ishta'.
Discussion
| What is 'Ishta' in the fulfillment of desires? Its form is stated here - in the Yajna, the authorized-officiating Brahmana is called 'Rtvig'. By such Rtvigs, in the presence of other Brahmanas, inside the Vedi, through mantrasanskars, the donation of gold etc. given according to the ritual, is called 'Ishta'. Because the meaning of the word 'Ishta' is fully fulfilled in it. With the intention of 'I want to give such and such donation', the donation given in the Yajna according to the ritual, is called 'Ishta'. In this, a serious pledge of Ishta donation is taken in the presence of the Mahajan, therefore this is 'Ishta'.
Here, following the ritual prevalent in the external Yajna, it has been said. The word Yajna is derived from the root 'Yaj'. Its original meaning is 'Yaj' means to worship-to worship, from that Yajna
means to worship-to worship the Ishta Dev, and in that worship, there is a feeling of offering Yajna - a feeling of offering Homa, so offering Homa, offering is another meaning of Brahmayajna. That is, to perform Danadi Sadanushtan with the mind of self-offering is Yajna. Giving Homa with the mind of fatherhood-possession, self-sacrifice, selflessly-selflessly, whatever is given, whatever is Ishta-intended Danadi, that is Yajna and that is Ishta; not that offering to other animals etc. is Yajna, that is the distortion and irony of that Yajna. The main point here is to offer oneself and one's father's property as a sacrifice. The noble feeling behind Yajna is the renunciation of possession-self-sacrifice, true renunciation of selfishness. Even today, if we make a comparative analogy, the assembly of the noble people (Brahmanas), the donor householder (Rtvigs), from the Vyasapeeth (Vedi), with a solemn pledge-ritual announcement (through mantrasanskar), the father's Ishta donation is announced (announcement), that whole ritual also somewhat resembles the said Yajna ritual, it seems like a small version of it! Let it be! This is the story of the external Yajna. Otherwise, the true transcendental Yajna is internal,

Mani Shay - Spiritual Feelings
(373) This is the spiritual yajna, the Brahman yajna, and it is the most excellent, and all good men agree to it.
Mahatma Jnaneshwar Maharaj says:
O Path! In such a way that one washes away all one's sins, by churning in the heart-shaped churn, and pressing it with the wheel-shaped weight, and shaking it with the peace-shaped rope, and churning it with the Guru-word-shaped mantra. In this way, by churning all the tendencies, there is immediate accomplishment of the task. That accomplishment is that, there, immediately, the fire of knowledge is ignited. That is, first, the smoke produced by the Moharoop of the Adhisiddhi, is covered, and the spark of the fire is produced. After that, with the help of the mind-shaped fuel, which is naturally prepared by the Yama-Niyam, that fire is ignited. With its help, a large flame is produced. After that, the desire-shaped fuel is burned by applying various types of love-shaped ghee. After that, the soul-shaped initiate, offers the oblation of the senses-actions in the ignited fire of knowledge. Finally, with the help of the "Suva" named yajna vessel of the Pranakarma, after offering the full oblation in the fire, the benefit of the Abhhuth bath is obtained, and after offering the oblation of the senses etc. in the fire of restraint, the remaining soul-bliss is accepted as the offering.
First, by the fullness of the renunciation-shaped fuel, the sense-shaped fire is ignited, and the subject-shaped material is offered in it, then the desire-shaped foundation is purified, and the fundamental mudra is tied on it, and the body-shaped mandap is erected on it. In that place, the sense-shaped gold is offered in the fire-pit of the sense-restraint-shaped fire, and the havan is performed with the yoga mantra. After that, the mind and breath are prepared as the offering material, and the pure fire of knowledge is satisfied without smoke. In this way, by offering that literature to knowledge, then that knowledge is absorbed in Brahman, that is, "ब्रह्माग्नि ब्रह्म हविब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् । ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना ॥
सर्वाणींद्रियकर्माणि प्राणकर्माणि चापरे । आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ जुह्यति ज्ञानदीपिते ॥ श्रेयस्कर मचाबला ज्ञानयज्ञ परंतर सर्व वि पार्थ ज्ञाने परिनवयो ”—गीता.
That is, (1) The Brahman which is offered, is the Brahman-shaped offering (offering material), in the Brahman fire, it is offered by Brahman; and by the Brahman-karma-samadhi, one has to go to Brahman, one has to attain Brahman. (2) Others, on the other hand, offer all the sense-actions and breath-actions in the self-restraint-shaped fire, which is illuminated by knowledge. (3) O Parth! The knowledge-yajna is more beneficial than the material yajna. O Parth! All actions are ultimately resolved in knowledge.

(374)
When the collection of the senses is destroyed, only the soul and Brahman remain. This is considered to be the Adhyajna, the Brahman. - Jnaneshwari Gita. | The 12th chapter of the Uttaraadhyayanasutra also briefly expresses the same sentiment as Shri Jnaneshwarji. A Brahmin asks Harikeshibal Muni, who was a Chandala by birth - "O Muni! What is your Agni (fire)? What is your spiritual abode - Agni sthana? What is your Suva (tongs)? What are your Bhavayajna fuels (dung-wood)? Who are your Samidhas? With what do you perform the Agnihotra?" The Muni replies - "Tap is my Agni (fire), the Jiva is my abode, the Yugas are my Suva (tongs), the body is my fuel (dung-wood), Karma is my Samidha, restraint and Yoga are my peace, and I perform the Agnihotra with the Rishi connection." Maharshi Haribhadracharya also says in the "Agnikarika" Ashtak - "One should perform the Agnikarika with the fire of Dharma Dhyana, which is based on Karma Indhana and in which the offering of goodwill is made."
"कर्मेन्धनं समाश्रित्य दृढा सद्भावना हुतिः।
धर्मध्याग्निना कार्या दीक्षितेनाग्निकारिका ॥" Thus, the true and excellent Yajna is the Bhavayajna, the Adhyatma Yajna, the Brahmayajna. The other external Yajnas - Ishta - are for those who are Sakama, they are not part of Moksha. For the Akam Mumukushu, the Agnikarika mentioned above is the right one, and he should always keep this "Dhooni" burning.
Also -

And what is this kind of thing? For this it is said - Purva Tarvavido Vidu - the true meaning is known by the Tatvavido. "के ते जोइ किं व ते जोइठाणं १ का ते सुआ किं व ते कारिसंगं ? एहा य ते कयरा संति भिक्खू ! कयरेण होमेण हुणासि जोइं ?" The Muni replies "तवो जोई जीवो जोइठाणं, जोगा सुआ सरीरं कारिसंग ।।

##  Deemadrushti:  Even in similar observances, the intention makes the difference.

(375) Wells, ponds, and tanks, and temples, and feeding the hungry;
All these are considered "Puta" by the wise, like a fever's cure. 

**Commentary**

Building wells, digging ponds, constructing tanks, building temples, and feeding the hungry, all these are considered "Puta" (acts of merit) according to the definition of the wise. (1) Building wells, etc., for water, is a beneficial act for the welfare of the public. Whoever comes to quench their thirst and finds relief, blesses the one who built the water reservoir in their heart, thus how can it not be a meritorious act? Although there may be some faults like violence, etc., involved, still, life cannot survive without water, so providing it where it is lacking is a beneficial "Puta" act for the people. (2) Similarly, feeding the hungry, building shelters for the needy, performing virtuous acts, etc., are all forms of service to the people. And since one cannot live without food, providing food to the poor, the suffering, and the destitute is a meritorious "Puta" act. During times of famine, excessive rain, drought, etc., providing relief centers to the best of one's ability and alleviating the shortage of food is also a form of "Puta" act. (3) Similarly, by implication, giving medicine, building hospitals wherever needed for the best care of the sick, opening pharmacies and clinics, opening orphanages and homes for the disabled, are also forms of "Puta" acts. Thus, wherever there is a lack of resources for the welfare of the people in this world, fulfilling that need is a "Puta" act. (4) Similarly, wherever there is a lack of resources for the spiritual welfare of the people, fulfilling that need is also a "Puta" act. For example, building temples, building dharmasalas (rest houses), building schools for spiritual studies, building hospitals, building shelters, etc.

**Highlighting the intention** (primarily) it is said:

"The intention is different, even in similar observances.
The ultimate goal is the same, whether it is water or agriculture." (118)

**Explanation:**

"Abhisandhi" - through the intention, the characteristic of the intention. What? It is different in the end. The fruits of the worldly deeds are different, even though the offerings like "Deeksha" etc. are similar, the ultimate goal, the main purpose, the reason - all these are the same, the intention itself, here, in the ultimate achievement. Just like? It is said that - water in agriculture, the act of farming. This is a well-established example. 

Page #452:
---------------------------
(376)
The community of the Gadashti, though performing the same rituals, have different intentions, and therefore their fruits are different. Just as water is the most important factor in agriculture, so too is intention the most important factor in achieving the desired fruit. 118, Therefore, even though the rituals are the same, the fruits are different due to the intention. Therefore, intention is the most important factor in achieving the desired fruit, just as water is in agriculture.

The form of fulfillment of desires that was discussed above, even though the rituals are the same, the fruits are different according to the intention.

For example, five people may perform the same rituals of yajna, dana, etc., or may perform the same actions like digging wells, etc., but the fruits they receive will be different according to their intentions. This is because the fruits are different according to the intention, therefore intention is the most important factor in achieving the desired fruit. Here, a well-known example is given: just as water is the most important factor in agriculture, so too is intention in this case. Even if the land is good, the seeds are good, and the land is well-cultivated, but there is no water, then all this is in vain. If there is water, then all this is successful. In the same way, in the same rituals of yajna, dana, etc., intention is the most important factor.

Due to the difference in intention, it is said:
रागादिभिरयं चेह भिद्यतेऽनेकधा नृणाम् । नानाफलोपभोक्तृणां तथा बुद्धयादिभेदतः ॥ ११९ ।। 
चित्र लगी लेकने, रागादिથી આ એમ;
बहु प्रकारे भिन्न अहिं, बुद्धयादि भेरे तेम 119, 
Meaning: This intention is divided into many ways by raga, etc., and by the difference in intelligence, etc., of those who enjoy different fruits. 

Kutte - Kimi - This intention is also divided into many ways by raga, etc., in this world, by the difference in the minds of humans, by the difference in their softness, medium, and firmness. Which specific humans? It is said: those who enjoy different fruits, and by the difference in intelligence, etc., of those who enjoy different fruits.

**Dimdarshti: Distinction of Intention from Attachment and Intellect**
**Discussion**
And even within this intention, there is a distinction. What is the reason for this? It is explained here that this distinction arises according to attachment and its derivatives. Just as there are different results of attachment, aversion, and delusion, so too there are different intentions and aspirations. For example, some people have a mild level of attachment, aversion, and delusion, while others have a moderate level, and still others have a very intense level. Thus, even in performing the same action, there are distinctions in intention based on the intensity of attachment and its derivatives. And according to intention, there is also a distinction in the fruits of action. The fruit received is in accordance with the intention.
For example, there are three householders who each donate the same amount of money to charity, or build a temple or hospital. But one of them is motivated by a desire for fame, he craves recognition, and thinks, "People will praise me, my name will be inscribed on a plaque, and a statue of me will be erected." The second is also motivated by a desire for fame, but he is also inspired by a sense of service. The third is motivated solely by altruism and love for others. Thus, in the same action, the three have different levels of attachment and its derivatives, therefore their intentions are different, and therefore the fruits of their actions are also different. The first receives fame, but the fruit does not go beyond that. The second receives fame along with some special merit. The third accumulates a vast store of merit, and just as the roots of a tree are hidden beneath the ground, so too he receives the fruits of fame and recognition, but he, being a great soul and pure servant, does not care about them.
Similarly, there is a distinction in intention based on the distinction of intellect and its derivatives. The type of understanding one has determines one's intention. The nature of this distinction of intellect and its derivatives is explained below.

Buddhi, Jnana and Asamaah are the three types of Bodha, as stated in the scriptures. Due to the difference in these three, all the actions of all beings are differentiated. 120.

Meaning: Buddhi, Jnana and Asamaah are the three types of Bodha. Due to the difference in these three, all the actions of all beings are differentiated.

Discussion:
The scriptures state that there are three types of Bodha: (1) Buddhi-rupa Bodha, (2) Jnana-rupa Bodha, (3) Asamaah-rupa Bodha. The characteristics of these three will be discussed later. Due to the difference in these three types of Bodha, all beings with bodies have a difference in their actions, including their desires. The type of Bodha one has, the type of understanding one has, and the type of actions one performs are all interconnected. This is because the difference in the purpose leads to a difference in the result. This is a well-known principle. The cause is different, so the effect is also different. This is a well-known principle. Thus, in the same action, there is a difference in the intensity of the Bodha, and a difference in the intensity of the action.

Therefore:

## Deepradrushti: The Gem-like Example of Intellect, Knowledge, and Asamoh Karma

**(379)** **Meaning:**  "Intellect" is that which relies on sense objects. "Knowledge" is that which is derived from scriptures (or tradition). And "Asamoh" is that knowledge which is accompanied by righteous conduct.

**Analysis:**

**(1)** The intellect relies on sense objects. The object perceived by the senses becomes the subject of the intellect. The understanding that arises from the senses is the intellect-based knowledge. For example, seeing a pilgrim inspires the intellect to think about pilgrimage. This is intellect-based understanding. There is no understanding of the nature of the pilgrimage itself, only the thought, "How good it would be to go on pilgrimage, seeing others going there."

**(2)** Knowledge is derived from scriptures. The understanding that arises from scriptures or the deceased is knowledge-based understanding. For example, the knowledge of the rituals of pilgrimage comes from scriptures. What is a pilgrimage? What is the nature of a pilgrimage? How to perform a pilgrimage? These rituals are known from scriptures. The pilgrimage is a means to cross the ocean of existence. There are different types of pilgrimages: material, geographical, temporal, and emotional. What kind of humility, discernment, devotion, respect, and honor should be shown towards them? All these rituals are explained in detail by the scriptures.

**(3)** And this knowledge, accompanied by righteous conduct, is called Asamoh or "Bodharaj" (King of Understanding). The knowledge acquired through scriptures is understood. Acting accordingly with that knowledge is the Asamoh, the gem in the bondage, the Bodharaj, the king of understanding. Thus, intellect is the understanding through the senses, knowledge is the understanding through scriptures, and Asamoh is the understanding accompanied by righteous conduct. And therefore, there is a difference in their fruits. Intellect is based on sense objects, knowledge is based on scriptures, Asamoh is based on good deeds. These three indicate the difference in their fruits. - Shri Ye Da. Sa. 4-16.

**Thus, their characteristics are systematically explained, and the text provides a suitable example:**

**"Rattnopalambhatajnanatatprayadi yathakramam |**
**Ihodarhanam sadhu jneyam buddhyadisiddhaye || 122 ||"**

**Explanation:**

**Snepastam:** The knowledge of the gem from the general is the intellect that relies on sense objects.

**Tadjnana:** The knowledge of the gem from scriptures is the knowledge of the gem.

**TabEyaadidhi:** The attainment of the gem, etc., is Asamoh, due to its understanding-based nature.

**Yathamam:** Thus, in this order, in the subject of intellect,

**Udarhanam:** The example is good (correct), due to its ability to achieve the desired meaning.

**Sadhu:** Therefore, it is said, "Shaikam yuddhwalisiddhaye" - to understand the meaning of intellect, knowledge, and Asamoh.

Yogadi Samuccaya
The perception of a gem, and then its knowledge; attainment, etc., are also like this place; this is the order, know the example here; for the sake of the attainment of intellect, etc., the virtuous example is the measure, 122
Meaning: - To know (know) the gem, to know it, and to attain it, etc. - in this order, here, for the sake of the attainment of intellect, etc., know the virtuous (samyak-sadhak) example, discussion
The perception of the gem, that is, to know from the ordinary that this is a gem, is the intellect that relies on the sense objects. Its knowledge, that is, to know the gem from the scriptures, is knowledge. And the attainment, etc., of that gem, the example of that gem, is asamaha due to the medhagarbha. Thus, in this order, here is a virtuous-samyak example with respect to intellect, etc.; because it is the desired-desired, etc., it is truly a sadhak, therefore, the true form of intellect, knowledge, asamahu is presented here as an example of this worldly gem: (1) Just as there is a gem, seeing it, knowing from the ordinary, from the object of the eye, 'this is a gem', that knowledge is the intellect. (2) And through the scriptures that describe the characteristics of the gem, based on it, the special knowledge of the characteristics of that gem, that is the knowledge-like medha. (3) And knowing the definite form of that gem, recognizing it as it is, the attainment, etc., of that gem, is the asamaha-like medha. In asamaha, the knowledge of that form is inherent, because if there is no knowledge of that form, how can asamaha arise? Without recognizing, without understanding the form, how can one accept? Therefore, when one recognizes properly, when there is direct attainment, etc., where is asamaha? There is only asamaha.

It states the characteristic of sadanushtana -

Vriti: - Only: - Aadar, yatnatishay (excess mind), in karana - action, priti: - priti, abhidhwangarup priti (love, deep affection), vinn: - avidma, - in its karana, in doing that ista, etc., due to the ability of avidhra-adrusht, sampvaam-sampad aagam, attainment of wealth, - therefore, due to the punya-siddhi of auspicious feeling, nijgnadha-jijgnasa, desire to know, the desire of ista, etc., taleva 2 - and tanni - service of the knowledgeable person, ista proper service, 6 - from the word, there is acceptance of grace, sanushtanalakshalam - this is the characteristic of sanushtana. Because it is anubandhasarpana (it is anubandhapradhana, by tradition, it has auspicious anubhadh in succession).

## Dikad: A Sign of Right Conduct

**(381)** Respect, affection, non-attachment, and attainment of wealth;
Inquiry, service to the knowledgeable, and right action are its signs. 

**Meaning:** Respect, affection, non-attachment, attainment of wealth, inquiry, service to the knowledgeable, and their grace - these are the signs of right conduct (action).

**Commentary:** The right conduct mentioned above, its signs are shown here: (1) Respect in action, (2) Affection, (3) Non-attachment, (4) Attainment of wealth, (5) Inquiry, (6) Service to the knowledgeable, (7) Their grace.

**Signs of Right Conduct:**

1. **Respect in Action:** Respect in performing actions like worship, etc., means utmost effort. Performing actions like worship, etc., with great respect, utmost reverence, and extreme effort is a sign of right conduct. Performing actions with care, not being careless, and with awareness of their use, indicates right conduct. For example, in devotional acts: "With reverence, bow down to the feet of the Jineshwar, perform auspicious actions. With great reverence, fold your limbs, and ask for forgiveness... With reverence, purify your body and mind, and go with joy. Even if you have to walk for miles, become dust at the feet of the One." - Shri Anandghanji

2. **Affection:** Affection, inner love, and deep attachment towards the action-conduct is a sign of right conduct. Any action where there is no inner affection, love, or enthusiasm, appears dull, lifeless, and selfish. When there is love and enthusiasm for it in the heart, the same action becomes very beautiful, joyful, and exciting. The soul becomes absorbed and one-pointed in it. For example, in performing devotion to the Lord, affection is the first requirement. When a stream of love flows towards the Lord, and unique affection arises, only then is the joy and delight of devotion to the Lord experienced. Only then does the soul become absorbed and experience oneness in devotion to the Lord. "Ajit, what is the use of affection, if it doesn't please me, then what is the use of others? The jasmine flower attracts me, why should I sit under the banyan tree?" - Ajit

(382)
The collection of verses, Kekil Kal, is a beautiful composition. It describes the love between a creeper and a tree, a lotus and the sun, and a moon and a night-blooming jasmine. It also describes the love between Gauri and Girish, and the love between a devotee and the Lord. The author, Shri Nayavijay Vibudh, praises the Lord and his devotees.

Shri Yashovijayji Swami, the self-illuminated, is praised by the author. He is said to be the embodiment of dharma and compassion.

3. The absence of obstacles in the performance of an action is a sign of a virtuous act. This absence of obstacles arises from the strength of good karma accumulated in the past. The performance of a virtuous act is a result of past good deeds. For example, devotion to the Lord removes all obstacles.

Serving Shri Nami Jin removes all obstacles. The eight great siddhis and the nine treasures come to those who serve him.

4. The acquisition of wealth is also a sign of a virtuous act. Wealth is also obtained through good karma generated by good intentions. No action is without its fruit, just as no seed is without its fruit. Therefore, it is not surprising that the performance of an action results in the acquisition of material and spiritual wealth. Material wealth includes wealth, prosperity, etc., and spiritual wealth includes knowledge, wisdom, discrimination, detachment, and enlightenment. The acquisition of such wealth is a sign of a virtuous act. For example, the poet Yashovijayji says about devotion to the Lord:

"The rays of the moon shine brightly, the sun shines like a lamp. Those who are devoted to the Lord with humility are very powerful. Shri Nami. The garland of auspiciousness is wide and beautiful, many children are adorned with love. Shri Nayavijay Vibudh, the servant of the Lord, says that happiness and love are found in him. Shri Nami."

5. Curiosity, a strong desire to know about an action, anxiety, eagerness, a desire to understand the true nature of devotion, etc., are signs of a virtuous act.

## The Five Types of Anushthana (Ritual)

**(383) 6. Service to the Knowledgeable:** Service to a knowledgeable person, one who has true knowledge, is also a sign of good ritual. A true seeker, one who thirsts for truth and desires to quench that thirst, seeks out such a knowledgeable person. They sincerely and humbly approach them, seeking to satisfy their own curiosity. This is service to the knowledgeable, offering reverence at their feet, sitting close to them (Upanishada). Through this, they receive the knowledge that is the essence of Upanishada. Therefore, serving a knowledgeable person is a sign of good ritual.

"Serve the feet of the wise, abandoning your own self-interest.
You will attain the ultimate goal, and your own path will be clear." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

**(7. Grace of the Knowledgeable):** The grace and favor of a knowledgeable person is also a sign of good ritual. By serving them, they become pleased and bestow their grace. Although knowledgeable people do not desire such service, it benefits the seeker. Therefore, offering such service is in their best interest. Thus, the grace of the knowledgeable person satisfies the seeker's curiosity, and their benevolent gaze brings about the fulfillment of all the soul's desires. This is a sign of good ritual.

"Respect and devotion are abundant, obstacles are overcome, and prosperity is gained.
The seeker's service to the wise is a sign of good deeds and a mark of excellence." - Man - A. 6. S. 4-17

The reason this is called "Sadanushthana" (good ritual) is because it is based on good consequences. It is driven by good consequences, leading to a continuous chain of good consequences and an increasing amount of good karma.

Here, to understand the nature of Sadanushthana, it is important to understand the types of Anushthana. Because the same Anushthana can be different depending on the intention, just as the same food can have different effects on a sick person and a healthy person. For a sick person, certain foods can worsen their condition, while for a healthy person, the same foods can strengthen them. Similarly, Anushthana can be categorized into five types: (1) Poison, (2) Gar, (3) Ananushthana, (4) Taddhatu, (5) Amrit. These distinctions arise from the expectations and rules surrounding rituals like the worship of the Guru.

**(1) Poison Anushthana:** This is the type of Anushthana performed with the expectation of gaining worldly things like wealth and fame. It is called poison because it kills the true self and leads to the pursuit of lesser things, neglecting the true purpose of Anushthana.

**(2) Gar Anushthana:** This is the type of Anushthana performed with the desire for heavenly pleasures. It is called Gar because, as mentioned earlier, it leads to the pursuit of lesser things. 

Page #460:
---------------------------
(384)
The collection of wrong views (gadashti samuchaya) destroys in time, annihilates, earns evil in future lives, and thus slowly kills like poison, therefore this is truly a "poison" practice. (3) The practice of the ignorant (anabhogavant) which is equal to inaction due to unawareness is non-practice, it is the same as not doing it. Because their mind is extremely deluded, therefore it is said so. (4) What is done with attachment (rag) towards good practice is "ta" practice, because it is motivated by the feeling of good practice, as it has the momentum of auspicious feelings. (5) The feeling-filled practice which is known to be the right path (jinekt) and is extremely passionate is called "amrit" practice by the monks.
"Vinoti niti chaturmavatanam: punah samvelarmassattam amritam muniyava che
-Shri Gibindu "Jinagun amritpaan thi re...man amrit kriya ne pasay. Re bhavi amrit kriya anushtan thi re...man atam amrit thay re bhavi." -Shri Devchandraji
Thus, out of these five types of practices, the first three are unrefined, untrue, and despicable; the fourth is somewhat refined and true; and the last, amrit practice, is supremely refined, supremely true, therefore it is the main practice, it is the ultimate goal for the seeker of liberation, and it is the one that is desired here.

## Dimdarshti: Intellect, Karma, Its Fruits, and the Cycle of Existence

**(385)** All actions performed by embodied beings with intellect are the result of karma and its fruits, leading to the cycle of existence. 

**Meaning:** All actions performed by beings with intellect, due to the nature of karma and its fruits, inevitably lead to the cycle of existence.

**Commentary:** This verse highlights that all actions performed by embodied beings with intellect, due to the nature of karma and its fruits, inevitably lead to the cycle of existence.

Here, we see that all beings perform actions with intellect, meaning they are driven by sensory experiences. They act based on what they perceive through their eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. For example, when something is seen or perceived through the eyes, it triggers a memory and a desire to either accept or reject it. This desire then leads to action. The message from the eye reaches the brain, the brain transmits it to the intellect, and the intellect commands the legs to "go and get it" and the hands to "take it." This entire process happens in the blink of an eye. Moreover, a memory of this desired object remains, influencing future actions of acceptance or rejection. Similarly, other senses like ears, etc., generate knowledge through the intellect, leading to the perception of something as desirable or undesirable. This then leads to mental contemplation, acceptance or rejection, and ultimately, the creation of a memory that influences future actions. Thus, sensory experiences drive the actions of all beings. Eating, drinking, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, taking, and leaving are all activities that beings perform without any specific training. This is not surprising.

These actions, driven by intellect and sensory experiences, are subject to the nature of karma and its fruits. The consequences of these actions are inevitable. What initially seems pleasant, eventually becomes unpleasant and tasteless. What initially appears sweet and attractive, later becomes bitter and repulsive. What initially appears beautiful, attractive, fragrant, and pleasant, eventually becomes unattractive and unpleasant due to the nature of its inherent qualities.

Yogadristi samucchch
When we become averse, it appears to us as ignorant-non-existent. Because it is difficult to swallow the truth. Where it continuously happens is pudgal, and its nature is to decay-perish. Such pudgal-like objects, when enjoyed, initially seem sweet, but ultimately lead to bad karma, hence its result is aversion. 'The fruits of pakkal-indravrana appear beautiful, but after eating, they quickly become deadly, similarly, these objects seem nice to enjoy, but ultimately lead to aversion. The wise have called this enjoyment like the part of a snake-like the venom of a snake, it quickly takes life, and by enjoying it, even the gods have to wander in samsara. Thus, this buddhi-purvak karma of enjoying objects is the result of aversion.
.

"Hrishikarth-samutpanne pratikshan-vinashvare | Sukhe krutva rati mooth vinashtam bhuvanatrayam | Bhoga bhujang-bhoga-bha: sadya pran-apaharinah | Sevyamana prajayante sansare tridashairapi ||" Shri Shubhachandracharya chhakrit Shri Gnanav.
And such aversion, done with buddhi-purvak, only gives samsara, because it is not done with shap-purvak, it is not done by putting shashtra-masavachan ahead, it is not done by following shashtra-agna, hence its fruit-result is only samsara, which is like wandering in a dream.

That is-mutva-the limb of liberation, yoginam-kul-yogis, whose characteristics will be mentioned. The acceptance of kul-yogi is to show that it is not possible for others. For what reason? That is-shruta-shakti-samaveshar-for the purpose of the inclusion of shruta-shakti. This (shruta-shakti) is like amrit shakti. In its absence, the main kul-yogipana is not present. Therefore, it is said " - anuy-hatva:-because of anubandha-phal-because of the existence of tatvik anubandha in the attainment of the limb of liberation. (Because it becomes the limb of liberation, that is the form of tatvik anubandha). 

Page #463:
---------------------------
##  Knowledge-based Action, a Limb of Liberation, a Strength like Nectar

(387) Deliberate action, performed with knowledge, is a limb of liberation, and it is only found in the Kula Yogis, because they possess the Shruta Shakti, which leads to the cessation of karmic bondage.

Knowledge-based action refers to actions performed in accordance with the Agamas. Actions performed in obedience to the scriptures are limbs of liberation, and they become the cause of liberation. Because following the commands of the Aptas, the authoritative figures, is the primary purpose of liberation, and it is the royal road to liberation. Therefore, those who accept the scriptures as authoritative, written by the Aptas, and consider them as the highest authority, and perform virtuous actions, are on the path to liberation.

“You are the one who guides me to pure devotion, I am the one who strives.” “I have taken refuge in your feet, O Devchandra, with a pure heart.” – Shri Devchandraji

Thus, these knowledge-based actions, which are limbs of liberation and where following the commands of the Aptas is paramount, are only found in the Kula Yogis, and not in others. The characteristics of the Kula Yogis will be discussed later. These knowledge-based actions are called "possible nectar" for the Kula Yogis, because they possess Shruta Shakti in the lower state, and they perform actions without doubt in the higher state. Therefore, these knowledge-based actions are considered impossible for anyone other than the Kula Yogis. And the reason why they are possible for the Kula Yogis is that they possess the Shruta Shakti, and therefore they have the cessation of karmic bondage. This Shruta Shakti is like nectar. Without it, the primary characteristic of being a Kula Yogi would not exist. Just as nectar revives the dead or the unconscious, making them alive and immortal, similarly, this Shruta Shakti, like nectar, revives the dead or unconscious soul, making it alive, bestowing upon it a life of supreme purpose, and rescuing it from the terrifying death of the moment, granting it immortality. This Shruta Shakti, like a life-giving elixir, is the supreme nectar, and its inclusion, its proper internalization, and its firm embrace, leads to the attainment of the primary characteristic of being a Kula Yogi.

“Follow the words of the Jinas, they are nectar, respect the true path, abandon the attachment to matter and emotions, take refuge in the feet of Devchandra… the Lord who knows the inner self.” – Shri Devchandraji

“The words of the Vitaraga, the ultimate peaceful essence, the root medicine for the disease of the world, the antidote for the coward.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji 

Page #464:
---------------------------
(388)
By the great influence of the Shruta Shakti, which is like nectar, the collection of Gadashti and such other things leads to the attainment of Anubandha Phala, that is, one gets progressively more and more auspicious fruits. One auspicious fruit becomes the cause of another more auspicious fruit, and so on, the accumulation of auspicious fruits continues uninterruptedly and without break, until the ultimate fruit is attained. Thus, due to the influence of Shruta Shakti, the Kulgis get the Anubandha, therefore, these actions done with knowledge become the means of liberation for them.

Thus, the practice of Kulgis is fruitful with Anubandha, because it is Anubandha-Shuddha. To understand this properly, it is necessary to understand the form of three types of practice. Practice is said to be of three types: (1) Vishaya-Shuddha, (2) Trividha Anushthana Swarupa-Shuddha, (3) Anubandha-Shuddha. These three practices are progressively more important and their fruits are also more important. (1) The practice done by Bhrigu-Pat and others, believing blindly and naively that they will attain liberation, is Vishaya-Shuddha Anushthana. And it is said to be auspicious because of the slightest possibility of attaining liberation, but it is not pure in form due to extreme carelessness (sinfulness). (2) Swarupa-Shuddha Anushthana is that which is done systematically without Gadashti, that is, the practice of Ahimsa, Satya, etc., Yamas, etc., done in a worldly way, according to the established customs, is Swarupa-Shuddha Anushthana. But it is not according to the scriptures, it is not according to the scriptures, because there is a lack of Samyak Jnana, Shraddha, etc. This practice is pure in form, but not pure in method. (3) The Anubandha-Shuddha Anushthana is the same, but it is done with the awareness of the truth, it is endowed with Samyak Tattva-Parijnana, it has a proper understanding of the truth, and it is done with a calm and decisive attitude, and it is completely free from any kind of anxiety. This Anubandha-Shuddha Anushthana is pure in form and also in method.

"Triteeyam apyadaha kintu tattvasanvedanaanugam |
Prasantavritti sarvatra dadhapauturnatam" - Shri Gabindu

The fruits of these three are as follows: (1) Vishaya-Shuddha Anushthana does not remove the Dosha, that is, the Dosha that hinders the attainment of Moksha is not removed. Because the darkness of ignorance is very strong, therefore, such suicidal thoughts arise. (2) Swarupa-Shuddha Anushthana removes the Dosha, but it does not remove the Anubandha. The powder of a burnt frog, which has been destroyed, does not produce a frog from it, but here, like that, the Anubandha of the Dosha is not destroyed, so that another future...

## Deepraatrusti: Various Rituals and Their Fruits (389)

Faults do not arise. Faults are removed, but the tradition of their removal does not continue. When one fault is removed, others arise. It becomes like the situation of "blind year and calves graze"! Because it does not happen according to the rules of Guru-Laghav-Chinta, etc.; that is, there is no awareness of the proportion of the greatness and smallness of virtue and fault. Therefore, today it is considered external and unimportant, because it is internally impure, polluted, and like the effort of a beautiful fort for a wicked king. It provides protection from external attacks, but internally the king himself oppresses the people by looting them! How can the people there prosper? Similarly, in this form-pure ritual, despite the absence of external faults, due to the ignorance fault of the ignorant man, like a wicked king, internally, there is no increase in virtue. (3) From the third, there is a removal of faults, faults are removed, and it is connected by rules, that is, the tradition of removing faults continues, one after another, the pursuit of removing faults continues. This removal of faults has been compared to the initial foundation of a house. If the foundation of the house is strong, then floors can be built upon it, one after another. Similarly, in this ritual, the pursuit of removing faults continues. Such a ritual is endowed with Guru-Laghav-Chinta, it is truly aware of the proportion of virtue and fault, and it gives a generous fruit with such a connection. Therefore, here all activity is always noble. Such a ritual, pure in its pursuit, is beneficial to the Kula Yogis, and they attain a connected fruit.

**Verse 126:**

"Those arising from non-delusion, from one-pointed purity. They give the fruit of Nirvana, quickly, to those who have gone beyond the world."

**Commentary:**

"Asammoh-samutthani" - those arising from non-delusion, those who are free from delusion, those who are free from the causes of delusion. "Tva ekant-parishuddhi-tah" - from one-pointed purity, from the cause of one-pointed purity, from the cause of purification. "Nirvaan-phal-danani" - those who give the fruit of Nirvana, those who give the fruit of liberation. "Aashu" - quickly, speedily. "Bhavatit-arth-yayinam" - to those who have gone beyond the world, to those who have gone beyond the cycle of birth and death, to those who have attained liberation.

"From the third, there is a removal of faults, connected by rules. It is compared by some to the initial foundation of a house, like a foundation. This is a good thing, endowed with Guru-Laghav-Chinta. Therefore, all activity is always noble." - (See Yaga-Bindu for reference)

Gadastisamuccaya
A: And those karmas arising from asamaah, due to their solitary purity, are those who quickly lead to nirvana for those who are moving towards the transmigration of beings (paratattvavedi).
Discussion
Karmas arising from asamaah, due to their solitary purity, are those who quickly lead to nirvana for those who are moving towards the transmigration of beings (paratattvavedi).
As mentioned above, the knowledge that is accompanied by sadanushtan is called asamaah. Karmas performed with such asamaah, that is, knowledge accompanied by sadanushtan, quickly yield the fruit of nirvana; there is no delay or obstruction in them, because asamaah has solitary purity here. It is completely pure due to its ripeness, and it is quickly fruitful, just as when gold is heated with fire, the impurities in the form of dirt are removed, and finally, when it is ripened, pure gold emerges. Similarly, here too, as the soul is repeatedly heated by knowledge, the impurities in the form of karma are removed, and finally, when purity is ripened, the pure soul, like gold, is produced. And thus, when the soul attains solitary purity, then how long does it take to reach moksha? When the soul becomes capable of pure use, then moksha is in the palm of its hand, because "he who is capable of pure use, his coverings, obstructions, and delusions are removed, and he himself becomes manifest as the soul, self-existent, and attains the other shore of all that is knowable, that is, he attains kevalgyan." It is like this: "He who, by means of use characterized by the characteristic of the result of consciousness, becomes as pure as possible and acts accordingly, his unique power of purity becomes increasingly revealed step by step. Therefore, his ancient, extremely dense mahagranthi, udhbhgranthi, is dissolved, and he becomes extremely unchangeable, conscious. Then all his knowledge-coverings, faith-coverings, and obstructions are completely removed. And thus, when the unhindered, unhindered power of the soul is aroused, it becomes manifest as the soul itself and attains the other shore of all that is knowable, that is, it attains kevalgyan." Thus, through the solitary purity of use, moksha is attained.

## Deepradrushti: The fruit of Asamaah Karma is swift liberation (391)

Such swift liberation-yielding Asamaah Karmas, who possess them? For that, it is said here: "Those who are beyond the cycle of birth and death," meaning those who are moving towards the transcendent, those who know the true principles, those who are true knowers of the principles, they are the ones who possess Asamaah Karma. Those who understand the true principles, they are the ones who move towards the true principles.

Thus, in sequence, the fruit of Buddhi Kriya is the cycle of birth and death, the fruit of Jnana Kriya is liberation in the form of limbs, liberation in succession, and the fruit of Asamaah Kriya is swift, uninterrupted liberation, liberation in the immediate future.

"Buddhi Kriya leads to the cycle of birth and death, Jnana Kriya is the limb of liberation; Asamaah Kriya leads to swift liberation." (Mano 20)

## Summary of the Three Types of Medha

There is a difference in the length of time due to the difference in intention and opinion. And the difference in intention arises from the intensity of attachment, aversion, etc., as well as from the difference in the cause of the three types of Medha: Buddhi, Jnana, and Asamaah. There are three types of Medha: Buddhi, Jnana, and Asamaah. Due to the difference in these Medhas, there is a difference in the types of all the Karmas of the Jiva. (1) The Medha that arises from the object of the senses is called 'Buddhi'. (2) The Medha that arises from the scriptures is called 'Jnana'. (3) And the knowledge that is accompanied by righteous conduct is called 'Asamaah' Medha; that Medha is the most excellent, it is called 'Dharaj'. For example, when a traveler sees a pilgrimage site, the desire to go there is Buddhi; the knowledge of the rituals of pilgrimage is Jnana; and performing the pilgrimage according to the knowledge of the rituals is Asamaah. The general knowledge of a gem, "This is a gem," is an example of Buddhi; knowing the form of this gem based on the scriptures is an example of Jnana; and knowing the form of the gem with that knowledge, acquiring the gem, etc., is an example of Asamaah, the righteous means. Respect, affection, absence of obstacles, acquisition of wealth, curiosity, and service to the body, these are the characteristics of righteous conduct.

- Shri Cho. 6. S. 4-18

In that, (1) the Karmas of all beings in general, those that are done with Buddhi, those that are caused by the senses, are called Vipaak Viruddh, their fruit, their result, is the cycle of birth and death. (2) The Karmas of all Kula Yogis are done with Jnana, meaning they follow the scriptures, and the power of the scriptures is like nectar, therefore, they get a higher and higher tradition. Therefore, the Karmas of Kula Yogis who follow the scriptures are in the form of limbs of liberation, they become the cause of liberation in succession. (3) And those who are beyond the cycle of birth and death...

**English Translation:**

**Example:** “Bhavatiit Arthagami” detached from the cycle of births and deaths
(393) Here, the mind is indifferent to worldly objects;
Those who are detached from the cycle of births and deaths are Bhavatiit Arthagami. 127 Meaning:–Those whose minds are indifferent (without desire) to worldly objects are detached from the cycle of births and deaths, they are Bhavatiit Arthagami.
In the above discussion, the Mahamunmukhu who are Bhavatiit Arthagami were mentioned, who are they and what are their characteristics? Their characteristics are clearly stated here. Those whose minds are indifferent to worldly objects like words, etc., are detached from worldly attachments, they are Bhavatiit Arthagami.
Prakrit Bhave means worldly objects like words, etc., which are the result of the mind. Prakrit means the modification of nature, the modification of Pudgal. Worldly objects are Prakrit Bhav, meaning they are the modification of inert nature, the modification of Pudgal; and they are absorbed in the mind of the Paryamumukhu, they ultimately reside in the mind, meaning they are objects of the mind. Those whose minds are indifferent to these worldly objects like words, etc., due to their detachment, are called “Bhavatiit Arthagami”. They do not enjoy worldly objects, they are not attached to them, their minds have risen above them, they do not find worldly attachments appealing, therefore, they are detached from the cycle of births and deaths – they are truly detached from the inner world. Because the minds of these great souls are not attracted to the world, they are not attached to it, they remain unattached, like a lotus in water. They find the various creations of Pudgal, like dreams and illusions, to be painful and unbearable, and they find the consumption of worldly objects, which are the essence of Pudgal, to be like picking up sand in front of their eyes, extremely unbearable. For example, the great sage Shrimud Rajchandraji has described his father's experience:
“Although our mind is like an eye; the eye cannot tolerate even a speck of dust, like other organs. The other mind is like another organ. The mind that we use is like an eye. It is difficult for it to speak, explain, do this or not do that, to think about it x x because it is like picking up sand in front of the eye.”
–Shrimud Rajchandra, Patrak 313 (385)

(394)
How can these supremely excellent, detached, passionate, truly perfected-souls, who are imbued with the essence of true feelings, find delight in objects like words, etc., which are the fruits of intellect? In these natural feelings, they find delight in the common natural people, the ones who are attached to the pleasures of the body and the world, the six types of attachments. But the truly detached, inward-looking, liberated souls never feel anxiety or attachment. Such detached souls, the true "renouncers," are the ones who move towards the meaning and essence beyond the world, who know and attain that essence. Because even while living in the world, the minds of these great souls are not touched in the least by worldly feelings and desires. Therefore, they are like the liberated ones, they have attained Nirvana even while having a body, they are Jivanmuktas.
“Where there is the destruction of attachment, or where there is peace,
That is called the state of the knower, everything else is just a distraction.
The whole world is like a dream, or like a dream,
That is called the state of the knower, everything else is just talk.”
–Shrimad Rajchandra's Shri Atmasiddhi
There is only one path for them, the path of peace.
Even though there are differences in their states, it is like the path on the shore of the ocean. 128.
Meaning—And their path is also the path of peace, even though there are differences in their states, it is like the path on the shore of the ocean.
Discussion—And the path of those who are beyond the world, who are the knowers of the ultimate truth, is also one, even though there are differences in their states, it is like the path on the shore of the ocean. The clear characteristic of which was mentioned above, such truly detached, renounced, passionate souls,
Action—% Tu Madji—and the path is also one, the path with the characteristic of purity of mind is also one, Teshan—for them, that is, for those who are beyond the world, Ramprayan—Shamprayan, Shamanic, Avmeddji—even though there are differences in their states, in terms of the differences in the Gunasthanas, (even though there are differences in their states), Dhau Tibhavatu—like the path on the shore of the ocean, this is an example. And here, the ocean is different from the shore due to the differences in proximity, etc. (The path on the shore of the ocean is the path on the shore. Some are far away, some are near, even though there are differences, they are all "part of the shore.")

**Dimādasti:** The path of liberation for the seeker is one, the path of peace (Shantimarg).

**(35)** The seeker's soul is called "bhavatiit arthagami" (transcendent of worldly desires) or "paratatvavedi" (knower of the ultimate reality). The path is one, and the characteristic of that path is purity of mind (chittavishuddhi). 

The path is to purify the mind and the soul in any way. It is one, there is no difference in it. Shrimad Rajchandraji's Kokirna Vachanamrit says:

"Moksha is said to be one's own purity, the path that leads to it; explained in brief, all paths are Nigranth." - Shri Atmasiddhi

The path of liberation is one, the path of peace (Shantimarg), and this path is based on "sham" (tranquility):

(1) "Sham" means the ultimate evolution of the soul, free from attachment and aversion, equanimity. "The soul that is free from attachment and aversion is called "sam" (equanimity)." In this path, attaining "sham" (tranquility) is the only devotion, the ultimate state, the final goal.

(2) Or "sham" means "samya" (similarity); to attain the inherent qualities of the soul as they are, to become similar to the inherent qualities of the soul is "samya." What is "samya" is "dharma" (righteousness), and "the nature of a thing according to its characteristics is "dharma." This "dharma" is "charitra" (conduct), and "charitra" means "to move in the form of "hare varitra" (to move in the form of the soul), to dwell in the form of the soul, that is "charitra." Thus, "charitra," "dharma," "samya," "sam," and "sham" are synonymous. The point is that to be eager to attain the state of the inherent nature of the soul, that is the path of "sham" (tranquility).

(3) Or "sham" means "shanti" (peace). The peace of anger, pride, attachment, greed, attachment, aversion, and affection is "sham." To be free from external influences and to come to the state of the soul is called "shanti" (peace), and that is the path of "sham" (tranquility) or the path of peace (Shantimarg).

The very heart-touching form of this path of peace (Shantimarg) has been briefly presented by the great sage Yogishwar Shriman Anandghanji in his praise of Shri Shantinathji. In it, Shri Anandghanji, as if seeing the Lord in person, talks to him and asks:

"Shantijin! One request from me, listen, O King of the Three Worlds, what is the form of peace? Tell me, how is the mind tested? ... Peace."

"There is no sorrow in the Hindu religions, no sorrow! The soul that is free from attachment and aversion is its own equal." - Shri Kundakundacharya's Shri Pravachansar.

## Vagptisamuccaya

Then the Lord answers him, "O Joyful One, who has the space for such a question, blessed is your soul! Listen with patience in your mind. I tell you as I have appeared in the form of peace:

"Blessed are you, O soul, who has the space for this question;
Listen with patience in your mind, I speak as peace appears...peace."

1. The impure and the pure, the emotions that Lord Jinavara - the supreme Vitaraga Deva - has spoken of, know them as they are, with hospitality or utmost truth, accept them with faith and firm self-realization, this is the first service of the path of peace, the first step-footprint of the path of peace.

2. And those who hold the ultimate meaning of the Agamas, those who are Samyaktava, that is, self-knowing, those who perform the virtuous actions of Samvara, those who follow the eternal path of liberation of the knowers, those who are always unwavering, completely simple and pure, and those who are the foundation of pure soul experience, the service of such a true Guru is the ultimate support of the service of the path of peace. Similarly, to respect other pure supports, to abandon all other entanglements, and to perform beautiful sattvic actions by abandoning all tamasic tendencies, is the path to attain the form of peace.

"The emotions, impure and pure, that Jinavara Deva has spoken of; know them as they are, this is the first service of the path of peace...peace.
The Agamas, the Guru, the Samyaktava, the virtuous actions of Samvara, the essence; the community, unwavering always, the foundation of pure experience...peace.
Respect pure supports, abandon other entanglements;
Abandon all tamasic tendencies, perform sattvic actions...peace."

3. Similarly, to connect with the auspicious means - the Samyagdarshan, etc., the means of liberation - which do not have any contradiction in the fruits, which unfailingly give the desired mixed fruits, in which the words are connected with the meaning, that is, the words truly serve the ultimate meaning, and in which the entire Nayavada pervades, that is, all the Naya operate in a non-contradictory, non-conflicting manner, as a means of achieving the ultimate meaning, this is the best remedy for the path of supreme peace, the path of Shiva-form, the path of liberation.

"The fruits, in which there is no contradiction, the words are connected with the meaning;
The entire Nayavada pervades, this is the connection with the auspicious means...peace."

4. To perform the rituals and prohibitions that do not oppose the essence of the self, to respect the method of accepting the soul as described in the Mahajanas, this is the all-encompassing teaching of the path of peace as described in the Agamas.

Domaani: The path to liberation is one and the same.

(37) 5. Abandon the company of wicked people, associate with the children of good teachers, and cultivate the state of mind of yoga and samadhi, which is the purpose of liberation, this is the path to peace.
“Refrain from actions that are prohibited, and let your actions be free from obstacles; accept the things that are permitted, and let your actions be free from attachment... Peace is found by abandoning the company of wicked people, and associating with the children of good teachers.
Cultivate the state of mind of yoga and samadhi, which is the path to liberation... Peace.” 6. Consider honor and dishonor to be the same, consider praise and blame to be equal, consider gold and stone to be the same, consider all living beings to be equal, consider grass and jewels to be the same, consider liberation and the world to be the same, this is the peace that is like a boat to cross the ocean of existence.
“Consider honor and dishonor to be the same in your mind, consider gold and stone to be the same, consider praise and blame to be the same, know this... Peace is found by considering all living beings to be equal, considering grass and jewels to be the same in your mind.
Consider liberation and the world to be the same, this is the boat to cross the ocean of existence... Peace.” 7. Similarly, the state of our soul, which is pure consciousness, is the true family, better than all other companions, therefore, to enter into this pure state of soul and remain in it, is the best way to attain peace.
“The state of our soul, which is pure consciousness... is the true family, better than all other companions... Peace.” And so on, the nature of this path of peace, the path of peace, is described in the scriptures.
“The cessation of passions like anger, etc., the weakening of the passions that have arisen, the state of the soul that can be withdrawn, or the cessation of the tendencies of the beginningless time, this is peace.”
- Shrimad Rajchandra, Patraank 122 (15) All those who seek liberation desire to attain this one path of peace, therefore, the path is one and the same for all. Just as all the paths on the seashore are “paths to the sea”, therefore, they are one and the same, so too, the paths of all those who seek liberation are “paths to the shore of existence”, the path to liberation, the path to peace, therefore, it is one and the same. Then, even though there may be differences in the stages of development, some may be closer to this one path and some may be farther away. Just as some paths to the sea are closer to the shore and some are farther away, but they are all “paths to the sea”. 

Page #474:
---------------------------
(398)
The collection of Gada-shti (Jain scriptures) states that all those who seek liberation (Mumukshu) are very close to the shore of the ocean of existence (Bhav-paar) and the peak (Meksh), and some are far away. But the path for all of them is the same, the "Meksh-marg" (path to liberation). Thus, although there may be differences in distance and proximity based on the Gunasthan (spiritual stages), they are all united in the Meksh-marg. In other words, they are all devotees, worshippers, and seekers of the undivided, eternal, and blissful ocean of liberation (Moksh-marg).

There are not two paths to liberation. All those who have attained the supreme peace of liberation in the past have attained it through the same path. They are attaining it in the present, and they will attain it in the future. There is no difference of opinion in this path, no simplicity, no madness, no division, no acceptance or rejection. It is a simple path, a path of Samadhi (meditation), and a stable path. It is the natural state of peace. This path is always present. Without attaining this path, no one has attained liberation in the past, is attaining it in the present, or will attain it in the future.

Shri Jin (Mahavira) has said in the Sahasragam (a Jain scripture) that actions and teachings are the same path. And if those actions and teachings are accepted in the true sense of this path, then they are successful. And if those actions and teachings are accepted without understanding this path, then they are all unsuccessful.

Shri Mahavira will cross the same path that Shri Krishna crossed. Shri Krishna will cross the same path that Shri Mahavira crossed. When this path is attained, whether sitting anywhere, at any time, in any series, or in any yoga, one will experience the sacred, eternal, and infinite, transcendental bliss of the true path. This path is possible everywhere.”

- Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 32 (54)

From the desire for the location of the ultimate truth, it is said:

"The ultimate truth beyond the cycle of birth and death is called Nirvana. It is one and the same, even though there are different words for it." (129)

Commentary: What is the ultimate truth beyond the cycle of birth and death? It is the supreme, principal, and pure Nirvana. Nirvana is its name. It is definitely one and the same, by rule, even though there are different words for it, because of the difference in the way it is described. 

Page #475:
---------------------------
##  Dristi Parantattva Tirthi and its other names

(39) Meaning - And the principle that is beyond the world, it is known by the name "Nirvana". And even though there are different words, it is one and the same in essence.

**Explanation:** The principle that was mentioned above as being beyond the world, what is it? It is explained here - that principle is known by the name "Nirvana". And it is one and the same in essence. It is said below that even though there are different words, it is one and the same in essence - in ultimate reality, the principle of Nirvana is one and the same. No matter what name it is known by, there is no difference in the ultimate principle of Nirvana. It is beyond any principle and it is beyond everything, that is why it is called "Parantattva". When the oil of karma is exhausted, the lamp of the world is extinguished - it attains Nirvana, that is why this principle is called Nirvana.

Sadashiva, Parabrahma, Siddhatma, Tathata, etc. are the words by which it is known; it is one and the same in essence (according to the true meaning of the words).

**Commentary:**  Sadashiva means eternally auspicious, never inauspicious - due to its eternal auspiciousness, it is beyond all inauspiciousness. It is the ultimate, the supreme, Brahma - Brahma in the sense of being the cause and the effect, and being the support of all auspiciousness. Siddhatma means the perfected soul, the accomplished soul, the liberated soul. Tathata means eternal, because it is eternally present, it is called "Tathata". It is said:

"Because of its inherent nature and its cause, it is eternal. Because it is eternally present, it is called "Tathata". It is free from the three kinds of suffering, it is the ultimate reality, and it is the source of all happiness."

Therefore, it is called "Nirvana" by these words, it is known by these words, it is one and the same in essence, according to the true meaning of the words, according to the above mentioned principle, by these words.

Dhogatissuraay
Commentary: “The word difference is a quarrel, which is the ultimate truth; say Ganga, say Suranadji, the thing does not change. Manmehan”—Shri. E. S. 4-21
That ultimate “Nirvana” named element, which is known by different names, there is no difference in meaning when seen from the ultimate truth. Some of those different names are shown here: (1) Sadashiv, (2) Parabrahma, (3) Siddhatma (4) Thathata. The oneness of that name from the ultimate truth is as follows:
Sadashiv-Who calls it “Sadashiv”. This ‘Sadashiv’ means always Shiva, always Shiva, never Ashiv. In all three times, by doing complete purity, due to the absence of all Ashiv-unfortunate, this name “Sadashiv” is rightly given. Because being pure Sahajanmaswaroop, this “Nirvana” is always Shivaswaroop-Kalyanaswaroop-Mangalswaroop, the abode of all welfare-auspiciousness, Shankar Swaroop, that is, Sham-Atmasukhakar Swaroop. “Shivsankar Jagdishwar Roo Re, Chidanand Bhagwan....Lalana” Shri Anandghanji
Parabrahma-Again it is known by the name “Parabrahma”. Para means supreme, principal. And thus, due to the dependence of the good nature on the greatness-bigness, it is “Brahma”. Brihattv means that which is greater-greater than any other thing in the world. Or Brihattv means the Brahma where the extreme growth-extreme strength of the Atma-guna resides. Due to such Brihattv-Brihattv, where the dependence of the good nature of the Atmaswaroop is, that is, where the existence of the pure Sahajanmaswaroop is, which is the Sahajanmaswaroop, is ‘Para Brahma’.
The word Brahma is derived from Vruddhi-Dho (to grow, to grow), it is believed. And in that way, seeing the growth of the world, the development of the world, the name of that inner element is “Brahma”. x x But considering another etymology of the word Brahma-which is as ancient as the previous one-the non-specific form can also be revealed. From ancient times-from the time of the Vedas-the word Grita is used in the sense of vast, hot, uninterrupted, and that word is closer to the word Graha, so Brahma means uninterrupted object-element, that meaning also comes out. ”
-Prof. Anandshankar Bapubhai Dhruv

## Diimadrushti: A Name for the Principle of Nirvana
(401)

**Siddhatma** - It is also called Siddhatma. One whose soul is perfected, who has attained pure self-realization is Siddhatma. One whose soul is accomplished, who has no remaining karmic residue is Siddhatma. One who is definitive, meaning one whose all-pervading essence has reached its final limit, that is, one whose all purposes have been fulfilled, is Siddhatma. Thus, one who has realized, manifested, the pure self-form, such a self-born, self-formed, pure consciousness entity is Siddhatma.

“"He whose soul is enlightened, and who is the ultimate, and who is not other than that, to that Siddhatma, who is the source of infinite, imperishable knowledge, I bow."”
—Shri Pujyapaad Swami Ji's Samadhi Shatak,

“"In all realms, this is the absence of deficiency, the form of complete bliss; this is the fullness of the qualities of the soul, the unique nature of the perfected one... I go to the Lord himself, who is the source of all beauty.
This is the unshakeable, unperturbed, non-dualistic nature, the image of the Supreme Soul;
This is the soul-enjoyer, playing in his own state, the perfected one, the form of bliss... Swami"”
—Shri Devchandraji.

Furthermore, some know it by the name **Tathaata**. Because of its all-time, all-pervading nature, it is called Tathaata; because of its eternal, all-pervasive nature, it is 'Tathaata'. One whose pure, self-born, self-form is eternally present as it is, is Tathaata. Therefore, it is said that:

Its authority is firm, unwavering, due to its cause and instrument. Both cause and instrument are in its hands, subject to it. The cause is the soul, and the instrument that manifests it is the pure soul itself. Therefore, its form's authority, lordship, divinity, and sovereignty are firm, unwavering, and never changing. The cause of the pure, self-born, self-form is also it, and the instrument is also it.

This Tathaata is **Vischaagatmika**, and is free from the three types of suffering. Where there is separation from other states, that is, where all states have been separated, analyzed, where even an atom does not touch, where only the pure soul exists, such Tathaata is Vischaagatmika - the form of separation. And therefore, it is free from physical, mental, and verbal suffering, or from the three types of suffering in the form of disease, affliction, and obstacles.

(42)
The one who is liberated from the heat of yoga-darśana, or from the three types of suffering - ādhātmika, ādhidaivika, and ādhi-bhautika - is completely devoid of them.
By abandoning all attachments, the Lord attained his own state, and collected the pure spiritual bliss.
Let us sing the purity of Dharma to Dharma Jagannatha.” - Śrī Devacandraji. Furthermore, this is called para-bhūtakṣeti, and it is extremely fruitful in terms of its bhūtartha. The highest class of kṣeti, which is the ultimate form of kṣeti for beings and bhūtas, is called para-bhūtakṣeti, meaning the one who is the form of the Supreme Self, the pure, innate form, the soul of the excellent kṣeti, is called:
“O one who has attained the fullness of knowledge and bliss, free from all upādhis, with the fire of the extraordinary qualities and jewels, you are the Supreme Self.
O wise one! With a pure mind, offer your self at the feet of the Lord.” - Śrī Anandghanaji. And that bhūtartha-phala - the ultimate fruit - gives the true, real fruit, the imperishable, ultimate, true fruit. The service and devotion to the Supreme Lord, who is the pure, innate form, is called tathatā, and it definitely gives the fruit of nirvāṇa. The form of tathatā has been described elsewhere, and that verse has also been quoted by Śrī Haribhadrasuriji in his commentary. Its meaning has been considered here somewhat.
- The word "etc." indicates that nirvāṇa is named after the meaning that follows the word, i.e., the meaning that follows the word. That nirvāṇa element, which is known by the word "etc.",
is one and the same, only the name is different, not the meaning. Because the pure, innate nirvāṇa element is the same as the nirvāṇa that we have seen, it is always Śiva, because it is the Supreme Self, it is Brahman, because it is the pure self,
it is the Siddha-ātma because of the accomplishment of Siddhi, it is tathatā because of its innate, eternal state. "Etc." and other names that follow it also reveal its non-dual form, it is manifested. The one who understands this ultimate truth, attains the incarnation of Anandghana.
“It takes on many names, the one who knows the experience-based, thought-based contemplation, he is the one who attains the incarnation of Anandghana... contemplation.” - Śrī Anandghanaji.

Meaning, therefore, there is no discord in the characteristics of Nirvana and the characteristics of Sadashiva, etc., there is unity without discord. That is, Nirvana, Sadashiva, etc. are of the same form, are one, it is extremely well-known.
And thus, what is this Nirvana-tattva? It is the supreme principle, which is free from obstacles, free from disease, and inactive. It is of this nature-(1) Nirabadha-it has emerged from all obstacles; it is free from even the slightest obstacle, it is of the form of non-obstruction. And because this non-obstructed form is its state, there is a unique, ultimate, innate, independent, unparalleled, non-obstructed, self-bliss that is constantly experienced. (2) Niramaya-there is an absence of any kind of material-emotional disease. There is an absence of the body, meaning that there is no possibility of any material defilement related to the body. And the soul is extremely pure, meaning that there is absolutely no absence of emotions like attachment, aversion, and pride. Thus, this state is free from material and emotional defilement, it is healthy, and here the supreme emotional health of the soul, the state of its own form, the supreme health prevails. (3) It is inactive. There is an absence of binding-cause, meaning there is an absence of effect. Here, all actions have been completely destroyed, so there is no motivating cause in the form of action, meaning there is no duty left. If there is a cause, there is an effect, if there is no cause, there is no effect, this is the eternal general rule. Thus, it is inactive.
Unique, ultimate, innate, nectar, independent, O Jinendra!
Free from action, free from suffering, free from other purposes, O Jinendra! “Pure result, the hero becomes the doer, drinks the nectar of ultimate inactivity.” - Shri Devchandraji
The combination of body, etc., is ultimately abandoned; the Siddha remains in the eternal state, gathering his own infinite bliss.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Atmasiddhi.
This supreme principle is free from obstacles, free from disease, and inactive, because there is an absence of birth, old age, and death, there is an absence of everything. Therefore, there is an ultimate absence of all suffering, because “birth, old age, and death” are the “main causes of suffering”. And “its causes are said to be two, “attachment, aversion, and their causes”. But here, this main cause of suffering, birth, etc., is not present, and because of that, there is also an absence of attachment and aversion. Therefore, in this supreme state of Nirvana, any kind of obstacle, defilement, and the cycle of action-samsara are completely impossible.

Damodarsti: There is no dispute for those who know the truth of non-duality.
(405) Knowing the truth of Nirvana, without delusion, from the truth itself. There is no dispute among the seers in their devotion to it. || 132 ||
Without delusion, from the truth, knowing this truth.
There is no dispute in their devotion, for the wise, it is fitting. 132
Meaning - This Nirvana principle is known from the truth, without delusion. There is no dispute among the seers (the wise - those who think) about their devotion to it.
Commentary - Such a state, which is uninterrupted, free from disease, and inactive, is the ultimate state of liberation, as described above. Its nature is known without doubt, from the truth - from the ultimate reality.
It is properly understood, and there is no dispute among the thinking beings about their devotion to it, because there is no duality in the knowledge of the truth. There is no dispute, not because it is not disputed, but because it is contrary to the nature of the seers - the thinkers.
The wise thinker, who is truly wise, always keeps his sight fixed on the truth. Since the truth is non-dual, they do not care at all about any differences in the methods of devotion and worship. They disregard the means of achieving the goal, because the goal itself is one. They do not look at the various means of achieving the goal with a critical eye, but rather focus on the central point of the desired goal. For example, if one wants to go to Nagpur, one can reach there from different cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Madras, etc., which are located in different directions, but the desired destination is the same. Similarly, although those belonging to different philosophical schools may worship the principle of Nirvana in different ways, their ultimate goal is the same. Therefore, there is no room for dispute about their devotion. Thus, the wise, who have a true understanding of the truth, do not get caught up in the false arguments about the means of achieving it. Because true knowers of the truth, who have a full understanding of the principle of Nirvana, never quarrel with each other. Not only that, but they consider all those who worship this desired principle of Nirvana, which is the ultimate object of worship for the father, as their own co-religionists, their own brethren. But those who are ignorant, who do not have an understanding of the principle of Nirvana, are far away from it, even though they are - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

## Gidashtisamuchya

It is a great wonder that people argue about the worship of the principle of Nirvana! The fault lies in the emptiness of the knowledge of the principle. The great and capable philosopher, Shrimad Rajchandraji, has spoken the ultimate truth in a very pleasing way in his great and influential book, Shri Meksha Mala:

"There have been many differences of opinion in the reign of Mahavira Bhagwan. One of the main reasons for this is that the devotees have focused on the knowledge of the principle. They have only been interested in actions, and the result is evident. The current population of the earth is about one and a half billion. Of these, only twenty lakh are Jains, including all the Gachchhas. These people are Shramanopasakas. Of these, I think that only two thousand men will know the nine principles. Even fewer will be able to understand them with contemplation and thought. When such a degenerate state has arisen in relation to the knowledge of the principle, then differences of opinion have increased. There is a worldly saying, "A wise man has one opinion." Similarly, there is rarely any difference in the opinions of many philosophers. Therefore, the knowledge of the principle is paramount." - Shri Meksha Mala.

From the above, it is clear that a wise person who knows the principle of Nirvana properly will not argue, and one who argues is not wise. What is the point of many?

। इति परंतत्त्वाभेदमार्गान्तराधिकारः ।
सर्वज्ञपूर्वकं चैतन्नियमादेव यस्थितम् । आसनोऽयमृजुर्मागस्त दस्तत्कथं भवेत् ॥ १३३ ॥

This is established by rule, with the knowledge of all. This straight path is close, how can there be a difference? 133

Meaning - And because this principle of Nirvana is established by rule, with the knowledge of all. And this path, which is close to Nirvana, is straight and simple, how can there be a difference?

Commentary - And this principle of Nirvana, which is established by rule, with the knowledge of all, is close to Nirvana. This path, which is straight and simple, with the knowledge of all, how can there be a difference? There is no difference.

##  **Deemadrushti: Sarvagyaavak Nirvana-Sarvagya Abhed** (407)

**Discussion:** "Different opinions are seen, this is the view of difference; in the root of one principle, the interpretation is considered to be a distraction" - Shrimad Rajchandraji. And this presented Nirvana is completely in accordance with the rule, this is the situation, because Sarvagya never experiences Nirvana, meaning that Nirvana is not attained without becoming Sarvagya, this is the rule. Therefore, Sarvagya is the inevitable future state before Nirvana, and Nirvana is attained only after becoming Sarvagya. This rule of Nirvana does not change in the three times, this is the firm, established principle. Thus, this Sarvagya is the path closest to Nirvana, and this path is straight, simple, and not crooked, therefore it is uniform. How can there be a difference in opinion about Sarvagya in such a uniform Sarvagya path? There is no, there is no. And since there is no difference in Sarvagya, how can there be a difference in its devotees? There is no, there is no. This is further proved and established from the above.

**Meaning:** It is established by the rule that Nirvana is attained only after becoming Sarvagya. Therefore, whatever is closest to Nirvana is Sarvagya, and whatever path is closest to the goal is the state of Sarvagya. This path is straight, simple, and not crooked, and in a straight, simple path, there is only one difference; because how can there be a straight path to a particular place? There is only one straight path (straight-line), there are many crooked and winding paths, this is directly evident; similarly, this Sarvagya path leading directly to Moksha is one. To follow this simple Sarvagya path closest to Nirvana is the closest path to Nirvana, and there is no difference in it. Then how can there be a difference in the true devotees who follow it? "The wise have become in the past, they are in the present; they will be in the future, there is no difference in the path." Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi.

**Unity of Sarvagya and Sarvagya Devotees - Summary:** The arguments presented here regarding the unity of Sarvagya and Sarvagya devotees are summarized as follows: (1) Although there is a difference in individuals in the transcendental Sarvagya, from the general perspective, it is everywhere...

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
The truth is one; and it is not fully understood by the ignorant. Therefore, from the general point of view, it is equal to the omniscient, as far as possible, according to their understanding, which is the same as the omniscient, i.e., the devotees of the omniscient are one. - Just as the many servants of a king are considered to be in one category of his servants. (2) Devotion to God is of two types: pictorial and non-pictorial. Among them, devotion to the worldly God is pictorial, and devotion to the non-worldly, liberated God is non-pictorial. Therefore, the desire of the seeker of liberation, who desires to go to the liberated truth, is one. (3) The seekers of liberation are one, and they are like the path of the conch in the ocean, one despite the difference in stages. (4) Nirvana, the name of the ultimate truth, is one despite the difference in names. Sadashiva, Parabrahma, Siddhatma, and Tathata, etc., are all known by different names, but the Nirvana truth is one in form. Such Nirvana truth is one, without any defects, without any diseases, without any activity, and without birth, death, etc. Why should the seekers of liberation who know and believe in this Nirvana truth argue? (5) This Nirvana truth is omniscient. Omniscience is the only direct and near path to attain it, without which it cannot be attained. Thus, the one Nirvana truth has one path, which is the truth, then why is there a difference in omniscience? And if there is no difference in it, then why is there a difference in the seekers of liberation, who are the true devotees of the omniscient?
। इति सर्वज्ञतत्त्वाभेदप्रतिष्ठापको महा धिकारः । 
Different countries are not different, the right of non-difference
Why are there differences in countries? The seeker asks:
चित्रा तु देशनैतेषां स्याद्विनेयानुगुण्यतः ।
यस्मादेते महात्मानो भवव्याधिभिषग्वराः ॥ १३४ ॥
Explanation: - Citra tu - again Citra, small types, of countries, 'the soul is eternal', and 'it is not eternal', etc., such - these - Kapil, Sugata, etc., are the goldsmiths, yat - hay, vineyaanu - nyat: such types of vineyas - the disciples, according to their suitability - due to their suitability. Due to the passage of time, the disciple who is afraid, relying on the paryay, makes the upasarjan - secondary, such a substance-dominant eternal country; and relying on the bhaga-astha, making the substance secondary, such a paryay-dominant non-eternal country. And they are not ignorant of the thing that has anvay-vyatireka, because they have the attribute of omniscience (not the attribute of truth). In this way, the countries are different, and in this way, they are different due to the difference in qualities, and they are only invisible - they are only invisible. Therefore, nothing is included in it, matmaan: - because these Mahatmas, are. What? Then - mavyadhimishvar: - they are the best doctors of bhavyadhi. They are the main doctors of the disease of the world. 

Page #485:
---------------------------
The teachings of the great ones are based on the principle of **dravya-pradhan** (substance-oriented) and **paryaya-pradhan** (mode-oriented) **deshna** (discourse) for the benefit of the disciples. 

(409) The **deshna** of these great ones is tailored to the individual disciple. 

Because these great souls are the physicians of the disease of **bhavvyaadhi** (the cycle of birth and death), they use different methods of **deshna** to suit the disciple. 

The **vivechana** (analysis) of the **gayos** (scriptures) is the same for all, but the style of explanation varies. The understanding of **syadvad** (the theory of maybe) is also true. - Shrimad Rajchandraji

The question arises: If all are one, why are their **deshna** so diverse? Why are there different styles?

The answer is that the **deshna** of Kapil, Buddha, and others, as well as the **gayos**, are tailored to the individual disciple. This is because these great souls are the physicians of the disease of **bhavvyaadhi**, the disease of the world.

Kapil, Sugat-Buddha, and other **darshanvadis** (philosophers) are considered omniscient, but their **deshna** (teachings) differ. What is the reason for this?

The great sage, the **shasakar** (ruler), has provided a logical explanation. It is this: The style of explanation is tailored to the specific disciple, to suit their nature, to benefit their soul, and to guide them appropriately.

Therefore, all of them have done so according to the nature of the disciple, in a way that benefits them and their soul. They have explained things in different ways. Their goal is to guide the disciple to the right path, to help them understand, and to bring them peace.

For example, if a disciple is an **anitya-vadi** (believer in impermanence) and says, "This body and everything in the world is impermanent, fleeting, and so is the soul. Then what is the purpose of this religion? Why should we practice it?" If such a disciple is afraid of impermanence and is **dravya-pradhan** (substance-oriented), then the great ones would use a **paryaya-pradhan** (mode-oriented) **deshna** to guide them. They would say, "Oh, **bhavy** (seeker)! Everything is eternal in its substance, and so is the soul."

The soul, from the perspective of yoga, is eternal in its essence (dravya) but changes in its modifications (paryaya). Just like the ocean doesn't change, only the waves do, similarly, the soul remains the same, only its states change. The remembrance of the three states of childhood, youth, and old age, all experienced by the same soul, clearly indicates the soul's eternal nature. Just as a person discards old clothes and wears new ones, the soul sheds its worn-out body and takes on a new one. The body changes, but the soul remains unchanged. Therefore, knowing that the soul is imperishable, immortal, and indestructible, you should be free from fear.

X
“The soul is eternal in its essence (dravya), but changes in its modifications (paryaya);
The knowledge of the three states of childhood, youth, and old age, is experienced by the same soul. Or, if someone claims that knowledge is momentary,
Then the one who claims so is not momentary, as their experience proves otherwise. When does anything ever truly perish?
If consciousness perishes, then where does it merge? Investigate.”
—Srimad Rajchandra's Sri Atmasiddhi.

Furthermore, if any disciple has faith and attachment towards the body, then, in order to make them understand, one should emphasize the impermanence of the body by saying: – “Look! It is not appropriate to have faith in these impermanent bodies. This entire world is momentary. It is constantly perishing. Beloved relationships filled with jealousy and sorrow are impermanent. This is the place of evil conduct. Youth is impermanent. Wealth, born from intense suffering, is impermanent. And life, which is the cause of the destruction of all beings, is also impermanent. Repeated birth, repeated death, and repeated reliance on higher and lower states, all of this is present here, so there is no happiness here. Thus, everything in this world is inherently impermanent in its modifications (paryaya).

x " Just as one discards old clothes and wears new ones, so too does one discard old bodies and take on new ones.
Just as one does not consider oneself lost when one's clothes are lost, so too does one not consider oneself lost when one's body is lost." —Sri Pujyapada Swami's Sri Samadhishatak.
"Impermanent is the beloved union, filled with jealousy and sorrow. Impermanent is youth, and the place of evil conduct. Impermanent is wealth, born from intense suffering. Impermanent is life, the cause of the destruction of all beings. Repeated birth, repeated death, and repeated reliance on higher and lower states, all of this is present here, so there is no happiness here. Thus, everything in this world is inherently impermanent in its modifications (paryaya). Therefore, what is the point of attachment for the wise? Abandoning the world, which is worthy of worship, and the eternal stain,
Serving others, the wise, the virtuous, have done their duty." —Sri Haribhadracharya's Sri Shastravartasamuccaya, Stamak 1. 

Page #487:
---------------------------
"Romadi: A thing that is Syadvadi in the form of Anvaya-Vyatireka is ugly. Therefore, tell me, where else should the wise have faith except in one eternal pure religion that is the only one in the world?" Thus, it seems that the difference in the country of all of them is due to the purpose of the benefit of the disciple, according to the difference in the character.

Moreover, it is not that all of them are not aware of the thing that has Anvaya-Vyatireka, it is certain that they are aware, otherwise their omnipotence will not decrease. Because,

If they do not know the Anvaya-Vyatireka form, which is the combination of Anvaya-form substance and Vyatireka-form Paryaya, how can they be omniscient? Vyatireka-form and other pervasiveness, from that Anvaya-Vyatireka, that is, substance-Paryaya, that thing,

Both of them together are the thing that has a tendency to meet, that is a wise and consistent thing, even a person with common sense can understand, then how can all of them not know? Because, "There is no Paryaya without substance and there is no substance without Paryaya," this other pervasiveness is famous. This other pervasiveness of substance-Paryaya does not decrease even if it is considered as a separate difference or non-difference. Because, if substance-Paryaya is considered as a separate difference, then there will be attainment of Atiprasanga; if it is considered as a separate non-difference, then there will be oneness of both of them, then what is the need to consider substance-Paryaya as different? And thus, if it is considered as a separate difference or non-difference, then "Syadvada" will come, even the meaning of the word will not decrease; because, wherever there is understanding, it is known by the name of Anvaya, and wherever there is a separate and distinct truth, it is called Vyatireka. Thus, even the meaning of the word will not decrease in a separate aspect. Moreover, in "other pervasiveness," the words "other" indicate difference, and "pervasiveness" indicates non-difference. Therefore, if both of them are considered as separate differences, then the possibility of other pervasiveness arises, meaning that the thing is different due to other pervasiveness of Anvaya-Vyatireka, that is, the thing has a tendency to be different due to other pervasiveness of substance-Paryaya, the thing is full of substance-Paryaya, this is proved without contradiction by justice. * "Anvayo Vyatirekascha Trayavyaparyayasamjnitau | Anyonyavyaptito bhedabhedavrttyeva vastu tau ||
Nanyoanvavaptirekantabhede'bhede cha yujyate | Atiprasangadaiakyasca sabdarthannupapattitah || Anyoanvamiti yabhedam vyaptischaha viparyayam | Bhedabhede dvayos tasmadanyonyavyaptisambhavaḥ || Evam nyayaviruddhe'smin vigethodbhavanam nrinaam | Vyasanam va jadatvam va prakashayati kevalam ||"
etc. (for details see) Shri Haribhadrasuri's treatise Vartasamuh, Stabak. 7 "Natthi vina parinam atho atham vineha parinamoh | Vvgunapajjayatho atho athittanivvatto ||"
–Shri Kundakundacharyaji's Pravachansar, that is – there is no meaning without transformation, and there is no transformation without meaning. The meaning of substance-guna-Paryaya is proved by existence.

How can it be that the true nature of things, which is understandable by good intellect and established by logic, is beyond the knowledge of all those who are knowledgeable? It cannot be. They must surely know the true nature of things, but for the benefit of their disciples, they have spoken in different ways, giving prominence to different aspects. Therefore, they are blameless, innocent. Because, in the hearts of these great souls, there must be a sense of subordination of the relative to the eternal, and of the material to the non-eternal. Any statement can only be made with the prominence of some aspect of the Nay and the subordination of other aspects, because only one aspect can be present in a statement at a time, and in knowledge, all aspects are present simultaneously. However, in a statement, one can only speak of each aspect in turn, giving prominence to one and subordinating the others. Therefore, it is understood that the statement of these great souls is not absolute.
“Kunthunath Prabhu Deshnar, Sadhak Sadhan Siddhi; Goun Mukhyata Vachan Ma Re, Gnan Te Sakal Samruddhrire. Kunthu Jinesaru! Vastu Anant Swabhav Chhe Re, Anant Kathk Tasu Name;
Grahak Avsar Bedhthi Re, Kaheve Arpit Kame Re. Kunthu”—Shri Devchandraji. And it is not surprising that such supremely benevolent Mahatmas and Mahapursha would do this, because their main objective was to cure this being of the great disease of Samsara in any way possible. Therefore, these omniscient beings, like the great physicians of the world, have recognized the nature of the being suffering from the disease of birth and death, and have given them the medicine of Deshna, which is suitable and beneficial to them. Even in practice, a skilled physician, recognizing the nature of the patient and diagnosing the disease, treats them properly and gives them appropriate and balanced medicines. For example, the medicine that is beneficial for a person with a Pitta constitution is not beneficial for a person with a Kapha constitution, and the medicine that is beneficial for a Kapha constitution is not beneficial for a Pitta constitution; the medicine that is beneficial for a Vata constitution is harmful for a Kapha constitution, etc. Keeping these aspects in mind, they experiment with medicines. Similarly, these great physicians of the world, the Mahatmas, have also experimented with different types of Deshna medicines, taking into account the nature of the being, it is understood.
What does this show? It says – *" विज्ञानमात्रमप्येवं बाह्यसंगनिवृत्तये । विनेयान् कांश्चिदाश्रित्य यद्वा तद्देशनाईतः ॥
न चैतदपि न न्याय्यं यतो बुद्धो महामुनिः । सुवैद्यवद्विना कार्य द्रव्यासत्यं न भाषते ॥" “Any other way to get rid of this external association, all this is just a war of desires!”
–Shastravarta Samucchay

Habad: The glorious physician, the remover of all diseases, has bound the seed-deposit and other things.
(413).
"For whom, in what way, the seed-deposit and other things are possible, for him, in that way, they have said here." - 135
Commentary: "The physician of the world, Jineshwaru, the medicine of the soul, your devotion;
Devchandra, the glorious Arihant, is the support of this person." - Shri Devchandraji.
And as said above, this great soul is the remover of all diseases of the world - the king of the physicians of the world's afflictions. Therefore, for the being who, in what way, the seed-deposit and other things are possible, in that way, they have, like a skilled gardener of the seed-deposit and other things, done the work of instruction for him. It is in this way: - Just as for plants, according to the rules of all scriptures, some plants need a certain type of fertilizer to grow. Some other plants need a different type of fertilizer. Thus, different types of fertilizer have to be applied to different plants. Keeping this point in mind, the skilled gardener applies fertilizer to the land so that the seed-deposit is formed, the seeds are sown, and they sprout. Similarly, this skilled physician also applies fertilizer in the form of instruction to the mind-land of the disciple, who is a special type of vessel, so that the right faith - the seed - is deposited, and it grows.
Just as the gardener, even after the seed-deposit is formed, even after the seeds are sown, waters them so that the sprouts grow, so this skilled king of physicians also waters that disciple with the water of good instruction so that the faith-seed sprouts and grows. Then, just as the gardener, to protect the tender plants, makes a fence around them, binds them, and waters them, so this expert physician protects the growing virtue - the disciple - who, in what way, due to the characteristics of the eternal law, the seed-deposit and other things, which are possible due to the non-attachment to the objects of the senses, are possible, by doing the enjoyment and other things, by becoming attached, in that way, by the virtue of the northern direction, has done, for him, in that way, they have said, they have sung, for that reason. 

Page #490:
---------------------------
(414)
To protect the sapling, the Guru creates a fence of vows and conduct, provides it with a suitable foundation, and helps it grow.
Then, with great care and affection, the Guru nurtures the sapling, just as a gardener cultivates a sapling into a fruit-bearing tree; similarly, this physician of the soul makes the disciple a tree of liberation. Just as a skilled gardener, through the act of sowing seeds, takes care of the sapling until it becomes a fruit-laden, humble tree, so this great physician of the soul, with compassion, showers the disciple with the nectar of teachings, ensuring that the seeds of right conduct sprout, grow progressively, and ultimately bear the fruit of liberation.
For, the sole purpose of these supremely wise, supremely compassionate, and supremely merciful physicians of the soul is to bring about the disciple's welfare. Just as the sole purpose of a physician is to cure the patient as quickly as possible, so these physicians of the soul, regardless of the severity of the disease, administer the medicine, with the sole purpose of the disciple's well-being. Similarly, these physicians of the disease of rebirth, without hesitation, administer the medicine of teachings that can cure the disease of rebirth, eliminate the delusion of the self, and bring about liberation. Their sole purpose is to quickly cure the disease of rebirth, eliminate the delusion of the self, and thereby the delusion of rebirth. If they believe that the disciple will benefit from the teachings of the eternal, they emphasize those teachings; if they believe that the disciple will benefit from the teachings of the non-eternal, they emphasize those teachings. They use their wisdom to administer appropriate teachings as needed. Thus, it is understood that the difference in teachings arises from their selfless purpose.
"The delusion of the self is like a disease, and the wise Guru is the physician; the Guru's command is like medicine, and contemplation is the cure." - This is how the second chapter of the *Atmasiddhi Pariharantar* resolves the doubt.
"Even though there is only one teaching, it appears different due to the difference in the listeners. This is due to the inconceivable power of merit, which arises from the karma of the listener." - This means that the eternal, non-eternal, and other types of teachings appear differently due to the karma of the listener.

The picture of a country shines forth from the unfathomable, unchangeable, meritorious power of the omniscient!
(415) Although there is only one such country, it appears differently to different listeners;
Because of the unfathomable, meritorious power, the picture shines forth in this way, 136
Meaning: - Or, although there is only one country of the omniscient (of all), it appears differently to different listeners, because of the unfathomable, meritorious power.
Discussion: Or, why is there a difference in the speech of the omniscient? To resolve this contradiction, another logical explanation is given here - although there is only one country of the omniscient, it appears differently to different listeners, because of the influence of the unfathomable, meritorious power. In other words, although there is only one picture, it appears as the country of the omniscient, depending on the listener's understanding of the omniscient's speech. There is only one, but because of the difference in the nature of the listener, the picture appears differently! Thus, the speech spoken by the omniscient is of the same kind, but there is a difference in the nature of the listeners, there is a difference in their merit and worthiness, so there is a difference in the listeners, therefore, the omniscient speech appears differently to them because of the unfathomable, meritorious power of the omniscient! Therefore, according to the merit of the father, each listener understands the omniscient speech as being beneficial to the father, and accepts it in a way that is beneficial to himself. Therefore, each listener understands that the Lord is speaking to him! It is said that the omniscient Tirthankara, residing in the Samavasarana, gives the country. Then, all beings, including animals, birds, and humans, understand it in their own language, and they understand its meaning! This is the wonderful, all-encompassing power of the word.
And thus, even one speech appears in many forms - in the form of a picture, and this is the influence of the unfathomable, meritorious power of the omniscient Lord. Because, with the power of the supreme, noble, compassionate feeling of "I will rule all beings", they have accumulated a great store of merit due to their teachings. This miraculous, extraordinary, great power emanates from them because of the ripeness of that merit! Just as the rain from the clouds is one, but when it falls on the earth, it flows in different ways according to the shape of the earth, so this all-pervading, torrential, rain of teachings is of one kind, but it appears differently to different listeners, because of their different capacities.

When these different streams of meaning fall into the Chittabhumi of the listener, they take on different forms! This indicates their unparalleled excellence in speech!
“There are thirty-five virtues of speech, and they are in the form of non-contradiction, they are the cause of the destruction of the suffering of existence and the cause of Shiva-Sukha, they are in the form of pure Dharma.” - Shri Devchandraji
And he also says that it is not that there are no virtues, he says - यथाभव्यं च सर्वेषामुपकारोऽपि तत्कृतः । जायतेऽवन्ध्यताप्येवमस्याः सर्वत्र सुस्थिता ॥ १३७ ॥ From this, benefit arises for all, as per their worthiness,
This is the nature of this, it is established everywhere. 137
Meaning: - And as per their worthiness (according to their worthiness), benefit arises for all from this, thus this success of this country is also established everywhere.
Discussion
“The nectar of speech of the Vitaraga, the ultimate peaceful essence;
Medicine for the suffering of existence, unfavorable to the coward.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji
And thus, the omniscient speech appears differently to different listeners, even though it is one, and what is even more amazing is that it benefits all according to their worthiness. Thus, the omniscient speech produces its success - its infallibility - which is established everywhere.
Shri Sarvagna's speech is one, yet it appears in many forms, and not only that, but the pure nectar of speech that is heard, benefits all the listeners who hear it.
Action - and as per their worthiness, to the worthy, to all, to all, benefit also, even, then from this, from the country, arises, arises, is present, is revealed. Success also, infallibility also, thus, this, of this country, established everywhere. * “क$ष्टपुष्यामबातिहार्यान्वितः

Hamaddhi: Ravana's Avadhya Desh's
(417) And that favor, the listener's as much as much magnificence-worthiness is, it happens according to the omniscient. As much as much as whose whose worthiness-eligibility is, that Avadhya Desh's that that to him him favor happens, virtue arises, self-benefit happens
is. As much as much as whose whose absorbing power, who who who about destruction-pacification-special, that that all that he absorbs. As if some Amrit Sarover is filled, from it as much as vessel is, that much vessel-proportion reception happens, so this omniscient Vachanamrit Sagar from, that-like vessel-proportion reception happens. That Amrit Sindhu from, from whom as much as is possible, as much as possible Amrit-drinking properly all some listeners do, and from that him that type self-virtue happens, that check.
Bhav upadhi gad avoid, Prabhuji is Vaidya Amegh re; Ratnatrayi Aushadh done, you saved Bhavjan Ogh re.
Dev Vishal Jirnodni, you Dhyan Tatvasamadhi re.”—Shri Devchandraji
Because the patient truly Vaidya gets, and Amegh Amrit Aushadhi to the world has become, that that him rag away why not happens? So this self-delusion from arisen this Bhav-shaped Maha-rag
who to is applied, such this magnificent listeners to Shri Sarvagya-shaped supreme Aushadh to the virtue-worthy to the world brought, and they have projected supreme Aushadhi-shaped Videsh to the destruction Amritvani ear to fell, then after them that rag why not be removed? Why
not be stubborn? Patient to the disease is stubborn or not, him virtue happens or not, that that his fault away-shaped sign from is recognized. As speech, bile and phlegm's disharmony from arisen Tridosh from someone is suffering, him Aushadh is given, that that his Tridosh away is seen, that understand that this Aushadh from him virtue happened; so this Bhav-patient rag, hatred and love-shaped Tridosh confluence from is suffering, him this rag-hatred-love-shaped Tridev which supreme peaceful juice-rooted omniscient Vachanamrit from away happened, yes that happened, that know that this Aushadh to this virtue is. And this omniscient Vachanamrit listening from that that listener's rag-hatred-love-shaped Tridosh certainly away happens, away is stubborn, garland falls, that is certain. So it is said that, Sarvadesh's listened love-veil away happening something being to Sarvavirat Parinam-bhav arises, something is Deshviratibhav to attains. Something to Samyagdarshan is received, and something just auspicious-bhav in position does.
Mahi being Lehko Kanchan, do Paras heavy is - Samati Suratru Van Sechanmen, Var Pushkar Jaldhari he.” Shri Devchandraji

The omniscient speech, filled with infinite and infinite shades of meaning, and explained with infinite and infinite principles, is beneficial to the entire universe, the entire world, it is a garland of compassion,
it is the savior of the ocean of existence, and it is the guide of the path of liberation. To compare such omniscient speech to the speech of the Jineshwar is a waste of time, and to compare it to the speech of the Jineshwar is a sign of arrogance, for he who knows this, knows that his own intellect is being measured. Such a supremely virtuous and omniscient speech is not understood by the young souls, only he who knows it, knows it. And in this way, Shrimad Rajchandraji, in his immortal poetry, praises the unique nature of the speech of the Jineshwar with utmost reverence - "Filled with infinite and infinite shades of meaning, it is explained with infinite and infinite principles; it is beneficial to the entire universe, the entire world, it is a garland of compassion, it is the savior of the ocean of existence, it is the guide of the path of liberation; to compare it to the speech of the Jineshwar is a waste of time, for by comparing it, one's own intellect is measured; Oh Rajchandra! The young souls do not understand this, only he who knows the speech of the Jineshwar, knows it."
Shrimad Rajchandra's Moksha Mala. Thus, the omniscient speech always bestows upon its listeners the appropriate virtues, therefore it is omnipresent, infallible, and unfailing, that is, it is always successful in all ways and everywhere, this is a certain state. The omniscient speech is like a panacea, it never fails.
The alternative explanation (another type of solution) says -
यद्वा तत्तन्नयापेक्षा तत्कालादिनियोगतः । ऋषिभ्यो देशना चित्रा तन्मूलैषापि तत्त्वतः ॥१३८॥  tatkaladin niyogathi, te te nayasapeksha
chitra deshana rishithaki tanmel a pan vakha, 138
Meaning - Or, it is the picture of the speech of the sages, which is based on that particular principle, and which is influenced by that time and other factors, this is also true, it is the speech of the omniscient, the root of all knowledge.
Commentary - Or, it is, tat-tan-na-apeksha - based on that particular principle, with the emphasis on the substance, the body, etc., tat-kal-adin-niyogathi - due to the influence of that time and other factors, due to the force of the passions, etc., - from the sages, from Kapil, etc., it is the picture of the speech, the picture of the speech. And this too, is not pure, therefore it is said that this too, is the speech of the omniscient, tat-tvath - from the truth, from the ultimate reality, - according to its teachings, and due to its nature.

The terms "Yogadristi Samuray" and "Nay" both convey the same ultimate meaning. "Nay" is derived from the root "ni," which means "to lead towards" or "to direct." It can be defined as "the way that leads to a particular aspect of the truth," or "the way that expands from a smaller perspective to encompass a larger one." It can also be defined as "a specific determination that grasps an aspect of the true nature of things without rejecting other aspects."  Anything that rejects other aspects is not "Nay" but rather "Durnay" (incorrect Nay) or "Nayabhas" (an illusion of Nay). "Nay" can also be understood as "Nyaya" (justice). Through the just method of "Nay," one can impartially examine the infinite aspects of the truth in a sequential manner. The term "Nay" is also used in the context of "Upadesh" (teaching), as in the phrase "Upadesh che te Nany che" (teaching is Nay). This is because teaching can be based on specific perspectives. Therefore, teaching is also "Nay," as it guides the soul towards the right path based on specific perspectives. It is a "style of explanation," and therefore, even the teachings of the "Trishi Desh" (three worlds) are considered to be "Nay-related."

The value of such relative teachings ultimately stems from the "Tattva" (truth) or "Paramarth" (ultimate reality), which is the knowledge of the "Sarvagna" (omniscient). The omniscient knowledge examines every aspect of reality without being biased by any particular "Nay." There is no teaching or meaning in the omniscient knowledge that is devoid of "Nay." However, the "Nay" is explained based on the understanding of the listener. Any error in the teachings of the omniscient is due to the specific perspective of the listener, and the value of all teachings ultimately originates from the omniscient knowledge. Just as many rivers originate from a mountain, so too do various teachings originate from the omniscient knowledge. The words of the great soul, Shrimad Rajchandraji, are a testament to this, as he offers his heartfelt devotion to the omniscient knowledge: "Oh, the noble, peaceful, and righteous path! Oh, the omniscient God, the source of the most excellent, peaceful, and righteous path!"

## Dimdarshti: Rejection is Highly Harmful

(421) Oh! You, the most merciful Sadguru Dev, who has made the most excellent peaceful rasa well-understood! May you always be victorious in this world! Jayavant Vatt! - Shrimad Rajchandraji

Thus, according to the all-knowing discourse, those Rishi Deshanas are like the daughters of one loving mother, diverse yet rooted in the same shelter. Therefore, they are also inseparable from the ultimate goal.

“The disciple learns from the Jina Deshana, the people say the maturity is different, the Muni says the path is different, but from the ultimate goal they are inseparable...” - Shri. S. 4-20.

Figure 13 (1) All Deshana Picture (2) All Dev are One (3) Rishi Deshana Picture
(According to time, place, etc.)

The picture appears differently to different listeners.
All Deshanas are one.
Paraya-predominant, Dravya-predominant, Anideshana, Nisandeshana (for the benefit of the disciple).

Even those who are outside the Deshana, the all-knowing ones, reject the prohibition, the right, the nature, the Rishi, and the people say:

"Without knowing their intention, it is not right for the virtuous to reject them. Rejection of them is highly harmful." - 139

1. Di - Taminaath - their intention, everyone's intention, Agnatvi - without knowing, R - not, Tad - because of that, Arvadashan Sattan - Avagudashti (sixth) saints, the virtuous. What? That - Gu - Tat - Gati - their rejection is appropriate, or special! Therefore it is said - Manarth - Maha Anarthkaranasil, of the nature to cause great harm, P - Par, Pradhan x"

Chey Shishurudh
Tas abhipray ladha vina, chhadmasthane lagar; pratikshep tasayukt na, par mahanakar. 139
Meaning: Therefore, without knowing the opinion of the wise, it is not appropriate to oppose the false saint who is the cause of great suffering.
Commentary
“Sab shastranake nay dhari hiye, mat mandan khandan bhed liye;
Vahu sadhan khar anat karya, tadapi kachhu haju na paan’–Shreemad Rajchandraji.
As mentioned above, due to these reasons, it is not appropriate for the false saints who are ignorant to oppose the wise without knowing their opinion. What kind of opposition is this? It is the one that causes great suffering. Regarding the resolution of the differences in the various schools of thought, as mentioned above, what is the intention of the omniscient? Without understanding this, it is not appropriate for the ignorant, i.e., the false saints who are seekers of truth, to oppose them. Because the knowledge of the false saints is covered and very limited. The false saints without omniscience are truly blind! They conduct their affairs with the help of scriptural knowledge, which is like a blind man's stick. Just as a blind man feels around to identify an object, this scriptural knowledge is like a blind man's touch. How can the false saints see and know the truth with this? Therefore, it is not surprising that the false saints cannot illuminate the meaning of the subject of omniscience, but it is truly amazing that they know anything at all!
“Sarvagya vishay sansthanchhadmastho prakashyatyarthan.
Nashcharyamevavatyapurna tu kishishi veshi.” Shree Siddhasen Divakachchh Murti Dvadvad. 8-11
Furthermore, the schools of thought with their different views are also fundamentally rooted in the omniscient, they arise from it, and therefore they are also part of the omniscient. Thus, the six main schools of philosophy are also integral to the teachings of the omniscient, and opposing them is truly opposing the omniscient. Shree Anandghanji's immortal words are:
★ "Antarakevaljhanam chhadmastha khalvachchhush. Hastasparshasam shakhyajnanam tadvyavaharkrit.” –Shree Yashovijayjit Adhyatmapanishadd.

Hari Padh Darisan Jin Ang Bhanje

Therefore, while considering those ten, “Chat” padaanti apekshavisheshne “Dhari” - first nyas kari, Sarvagna's aaraadhak santjane, they have not opposed or rejected it. Not only that, but by placing the syat pada, they have also placed the sthata pada in front of it, and have considered the Shat Darisan Jinadarshan, which is like a Kalpavriksha, to be worthy of worship. And the knowledge of this Jin Ang Darshan is not for refutation or argumentation, but for understanding the tattva. It is for knowing the principles and strengthening one's own principles. It is for testing the strength of one's own side. And even by doing so, it is for achieving one's own self-interest. Moreover, by holding the essence of all scriptures in one's heart, even if one has known the differences of refutation and argumentation for an infinite time, it has not brought them any benefit! Even after doing this for an infinite time, nothing has come into their hands! Their hands are still empty! Therefore, it is not appropriate for a santjane to engage in any kind of opposition or refutation. And among them, opposing the Sarvagna or the Sarvagna's words is extremely evil, it is harmful, it is the greatest harm. Because it becomes a major obstacle in the path of the soul's attainment of the right path, it leads to ultimate misfortune. Every seeker should constantly keep this in mind that a sant's

**Prāṇi:** Sun Bhedakalpana Ayukt-Janmānḍha Manushya ne Hathi
(425)

Again, if someone imagines that these blind people are of different types, some with a bent moon, some with a slanted moon, some with a square moon, etc., that too is inappropriate and against ethics. Because, one who has never seen the moon, any imagination about its form is just imagination, not truth. Similarly, if someone imagines that the omniscient is like this or like that, etc., that too is inappropriate and absurd. Because, one who has never seen the omniscient, any imagination about its form is just a false imagination, not truth. And, if those who have never seen the moon themselves, imagine different types of moons and fight about them, how absurd is that? Similarly, if those who have never seen the omniscient themselves, imagine different types of omniscients and engage in false arguments and debates about them, opposing each other, engaging in mutual criticism and refutation, that too is extremely inappropriate, as is evident from the above. Here, the example of a blind man and an elephant is very apt. It is like this—

**Bhed Hepana**
**Ayukt**
**Janmānḍha Manushya ne Hathi**

Once, an elephant came to a certain place. Six blind men went to see it. These blind men touched the elephant and examined it. One man touched the elephant's trunk, so he thought the elephant was like a rope. Another man touched the tusk, so he thought it was like a fan. The third man touched the ear, so he thought it was like a pot. The fourth man touched the leg, so he thought the elephant was like a pillar. The fifth man touched the belly, so he thought it was like a mortar. The sixth man touched the tail, so he thought it was like a broom. From this, they formed their own opinions and then told each other. Then, each one became firm in his own opinion, insisting that he alone was right and all the others were wrong, and they started arguing with each other, engaging in false discussions, and the dispute escalated!

Then, a sighted man came there and stopped them, saying, "Oh, good men! Why are you arguing in vain? You are all wrong, and you are all right! Because, you are wrong in your insistence that the elephant is like this or like that, and you are right in that the elephant is like this in terms of some of its parts. Look! The trunk of the elephant is shaped like a rope, the tusk is shaped like a fan, the ear is like a pot, the leg is like a pillar, the belly appears like a mortar, and the tail is like a... 

Page #502:
---------------------------
(426)
It looks like a broom. Touching each limb, you feel like an elephant, it is exactly as expected of that limb, but from above, you don't get the whole elephant! The whole body together makes the elephant. Therefore, to understand its complete form, one must consider it in time. You must abandon the insistence of "J'ekantavad". Understand this, now you must stop the argument! Stop it! Thus, the wise-looking, seeing man explained, so the debaters cooled down, and abandoning the false discussion, they understood and became calm.
This example reveals that the "J" ekantvadi who says "this is J" is insistent, but the sarva samanyavakari anekantavadi is always and everywhere non-insistent. There is a miraculous saying of Shrimad Rajchandraji, which in a few but great words, completely refutes all ekantvadis:
"Ekantvad is the sign of incomplete knowledge, debaters! I show you for your sake. Just as novice poets use the word "J" to suppress flaws in poetry, so you too say "J" meaning certainty, with novice knowledge. Mahaveer never said so; that is his unique miracle."
-Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 6 (20)
Also-
"न युज्यते प्रतिक्षेपः सामान्यस्यापि तत्सताम् । आर्यापवादस्तु पुनजिंहाछेदाधिको मतः ॥ १४१ ॥"
"Pratikshep is not appropriate even for the common people, let alone the saints; the Aryan slander is considered more than cutting the tongue." 141
Meaning- Even for common people, pratikshep is not appropriate. Therefore, slander against the Aryan saints is considered more than cutting the tongue.
-Not appropriate, pratikshep is in the form of refutation. The meaning is that even common people, common men, should not curse the saints, the munis, even if they are angry, because it is a sin against all. What? So- it is considered more than cutting the tongue (jihava cheda)- with the intention of such an act.
"WHच वीघं, नિષિદ્ધનાચંતિપુવિધાનમ્ | सकलनयविलसितानाम् , विरोधमथनं नमाम्यनेकांतम् ॥"
-Shri Amritchandracharyaji's Purusharthsiddhi Upay. 

Page #503:
---------------------------
The committee of the language of the Jiva, which is an exception to the two-fold,
(47) Criticism is not appropriate for even an ordinary man; therefore, to oppose the omniscient Aryas is more than just having one's tongue cut off in the minds of the saints.
If there is an ordinary man, it is not appropriate for him to refute, oppose, or contradict him. Because there is something in our mind and something in his mind. "There is something in our mind, there is something in the mind of the ordinary." We cannot know his intention or opinion, and to refute him without knowing him, to refute him, is not appropriate. Even if he does, it is completely absurd. Even more than refuting him, the other person does not give up his opinion, but often clings to it with double the force! Moreover, such refutation increases opposition, the other person's mind is hurt, animosity is created, a knot of attachment and hatred is formed, + joy, anger, and meditation arise, and the father also remains restless. Thus, many evils arise, therefore, the saints and sages do not oppose.
After that, it is extremely inappropriate to oppose the extraordinary, extraordinary, magnificent, supremely powerful, omniscient Aryas, let alone criticize them.
What is there to ask? Therefore, the saints consider opposing such revered Aryas to be more than having their tongues cut off. That is, even a single word of exception spoken to the supreme, omniscient Aryas causes them more pain than having their tongues cut off. And why would they be cut off? And why would they want to speak such words that would cut off the father's roof? The meaning is that the saints would never even begin to utter a word of exception to the omniscient Aryas, their tongues would not even rise to utter such a word; because the supreme, virtuous Aryas, by their criticism, cause great evil - tradition arises, the Jiva becomes eternally worldly.

Yogasarasaya
Saints rarely speak words that are tainted with malice or negativity. Their words are always certain, full of essence, and beneficial to all beings. 142

Meaning: Saints never speak words that are tainted with malice or negativity. Instead, they always speak words that are certain, full of essence, and beneficial to all beings.

Commentary: Saints never speak words that are tainted with malice or negativity, like the words of the wicked. They always speak words that are certain, full of essence, and beneficial to others.

It is only the unwise who speak words that are tainted with malice or negativity. They speak without regard for the situation, and their words are often meaningless and harmful. They speak without any regard for the consequences, and their words can cause pain and suffering to others. But true saints and sages never speak in such a way. They always speak with wisdom and discernment, and their words are always beneficial to others.

Therefore, the words of saints are always certain, unambiguous, and meaningful. They are never uncertain, meaningless, or harmful. They are always full of essence, and they are always intended to benefit others. Saints always speak words that are certain, full of essence, and beneficial to others.

The virtuous ones, with their pure intentions, speak words that are free from any taint. Their words are like a beacon of light, guiding others towards the right path. They are always ready to help others, and their words are always full of compassion and kindness.

Thus, saints always speak words that are certain, full of essence, and beneficial to others. They are always mindful of the consequences of their words, and they always strive to speak in a way that will benefit others.

This is the end of the chapter on the rejection of all-knowingness.

In the Shatashloka, it is said that saints never speak words that are tainted with malice or negativity. They always speak words that are certain, full of essence, and beneficial to all beings.

##  Two.  Giranagaya Atideviyam Anumanavishaya

(429)  While concluding the right of the omniscient and other atideviya (super-sensory) objects to be beyond the reach of inference, it is said:

"The certainty of atideviya objects is not without yogic knowledge.  Therefore, there is nothing in the debate of the blind regarding the omniscient."

**Explanation:**

The certainty of atideviya objects is not possible without yogic knowledge.  Therefore, even here, in the matter of the omniscient, there is nothing in the debate of those who are like the blind.

**Analysis:**

The certainty of the omniscient and other atideviya objects is not possible without yogic knowledge, because it is through this that their attainment is possible.  Therefore, here, in the right of the omniscient, what is the point of the debate of those who are like the blind, who are in a false position?

The omniscient and other objects are atideviya, they are beyond the reach of the senses and mind, and can only be known by yogis.  Regarding the true certainty of these, those who are in a false position have no right, because they are like the blind who do not see the truth.  Therefore, in the matter of the omniscient, which is beyond their reach, their debate is useless.  What is the point of their debate?  It is a complete waste of time.

Because, to imagine the form of something we do not see or know, to engage in a false fight, to engage in pointless arguments, to sow discord, to indulge in refutation and justification, and to increase animosity, is a sign of foolishness.  It is as ridiculous as the blind imagining the shape of the moon, or like the blind who were arguing about the form of the elephant.  Such false debate, instead of being beneficial, is harmful, because it leads to the destruction of one's own true mind.  In other words,

The certainty of the omniscient and other atideviya objects is not possible without yogic knowledge.  Therefore, in the right of the omniscient, there is nothing in the debate of those who are like the blind, who do not see the truth.  There is nothing in the debate of those who are like the blind, who do not see the truth.  There is nothing in the debate of those who are like the blind, who do not see the truth.

A mind with a bad intention, devoid of good intentions, gives rise to evil intentions, increases passions, hatred, etc., and causes unrest and anxiety in the mind. What is the purpose of such a debate for the saints who destroy such a mind? Nothing, nothing.

This meaning is not considered to be the subject of inference from the truth. Nor is there a correct certainty from inference, even in other matters, as the wise Bhartṛhari has said. - 144
This all-knowing meaning is not considered to be the subject of inference from the truth. And even apart from this inference, there is no correct certainty. The wise Bhartṛhari has said -
It was said above in the discussion that the extra-sensory meanings like omniscience cannot be known without knowledge. Therefore, there is no benefit from the debate of the blind in the place of deception on this subject. Then
Why do you say that? How can the extra-sensory be known even by inference - by reasoning? He answers here that - this meaning is not the subject of inference - reasoning from the truth of the extra-sensory meaning, which is all-knowing. No matter how great the mind of the seeker is, there is no movement there; no matter how much reasoning, the omniscient can never be understood directly. Because that truth is extra-sensory, that is, it is beyond the mind and the senses - it is inaccessible, and reasoning is the subject of the intellect, so it is accessible to the intellect. Therefore, in the extra-sensory subject, the movement of the intellect becomes impossible, and reasoning becomes futile. Moreover, let alone this extra-sensory subject, even other ordinary meanings are not correctly ascertained by inference; even ordinary matters are not properly decided by reasoning, then what is the point of asking about the extra-sensory meaning? In support of this, the words of the great sage Bhartṛhari are quoted here.

Even though an अर्थ (meaning) is inferred through effort by skillful अनुमातृ (inferers), it is proven otherwise by others who are more skillful. 145

**Meaning:** Even when a meaning is inferred with effort by skilled inferers, it can be proven differently by others who are even more skillful.

**Commentary:** What has the wise Bhartṛhari said? He says, "Even the meaning inferred with effort by skillful inferers can be proven differently by others who are more skillful."

Skilled logicians, proficient in the methods of Anvaya-Vyatireka, etc., examine the truth according to Anvaya-Vyatireka, etc. Anvaya means a positive statement that something is so; Vyatireka means a negative statement that something is not so. (1) Some skillful logicians, through effort and reasoning, establish a certain meaning and say, "Look! This meaning arises in this way for this reason. This is its affirmation. This meaning does not arise in any other way." This is its negation. (2) Then, other more powerful logicians, relying on the same Anvaya-Vyatireka, etc., prove the same meaning differently and say, "Look! This meaning does not arise in the way you have said. This is its negation. And it arises in the way we say. This is its affirmation." Thus, one logician establishes a meaning, and another refutes it! The same meaning is proven differently by skillful logicians with their sharp intellect!

**Vṛtti:** -  The meaning inferred through effort according to Anvaya, etc., is also proven differently by skillful inferers who know Anvaya, etc., by others who are more skillful and know Anvaya, etc. It is proven differently through methods like Athathasiddhi, etc.

This argumentation, like a wrestling arena, challenges the intellect! Just as the body is exercised, trained, and engaged in intricate games and maneuvers in a wrestling arena, so too does this argumentation, like a gymnasium of tactics, exercise the intellect, train it in tactics, play intricate games of chance, and engage in deceitful maneuvers! "The literate party wins!" Just as a stronger wrestler defeats a weaker opponent in a wrestling arena, so too does a more intelligent debater defeat a less intelligent opponent in this gymnasium of argumentation! Moreover, just as a stronger wrestler defeats even the victorious wrestler, so too does another, more logical debater defeat the victorious debater, who is elated and spreading his victory! Just as the tradition of wrestling continues, and the wrestling match never ends, so too does the tradition of argumentation continue, and the battle of intellect never ends! But even with this endless argumentation, nothing can be said definitively about the object itself! On the contrary, as the saying goes, "The tree gets uprooted in the fight between the two bulls," the tree of truth gets uprooted in this deceitful game! The truth is nowhere to be found. Mahatma Anandghanji's poignant saying is: "The argumentation continues, but the truth is not reached; only a few can speak about the object itself. The path is seen by others, by the Jinas." - Shri Anandghanji.
The author says:
"Even though the senses are unable to perceive the objects, they are known through argumentation. The objects are beyond the senses, and certainty is achieved through argumentation." - 246.
"Even though the objects are beyond the senses, they are known through argumentation. The objects are beyond the senses, and certainty is achieved through argumentation." - 146.

Deeprashti: The dry logic-grasp is to be abandoned by the seeker.
(433) Discussion: "The mind should be fixed on the purpose of the debate, the theory is very difficult; whether the theory is easy or not, there is a strong debate.
Greetings to the one who thirsts for the vision of the Jina." - Shri Anandghanji.
If knowledge of extra-sensory objects could be obtained through logic, then the wise men of the past would have made a definite conclusion about it. If extra-sensory objects, which are inaccessible to the senses, could be known by means of logic, then these great intelligent wise men - great logicians - who have been engaged in the pursuit of such definite logic for a long time, would have made a definite conclusion about those extra-sensory objects. But that does not seem to have happened, no solution has been found yet. Because these debaters - counter-debaters are still carrying on the same debate with great vigor! They still seem to be as stubborn as new students! Their arguments are still the same! These great powerful debaters have tried their best for so long, but it seems that these great men's efforts have gone in vain! Because as said in the Gabindu, "Even though they are engaged in definite arguments and counter-arguments, they have not yet reached the end of the truth, like the bull in the well!"
न चैतदेवं यत्तस्मात्शुष्कतर्कग्रहो महान् । मिथ्याभिमानहेतुत्वात्त्याज्य एव मुमुक्षुभिः ॥ १४७ ॥
And this is not so, because of that, the dry logic-grasp is great;
It is to be abandoned by the seeker, because it is the cause of false pride, 147
Meaning: - And because this is not so, therefore the great dry logic-grasp is to be abandoned by the seekers, because it is the cause of false pride.
Kritti - Jaithavan and this is not so, because of that - because of that, dry logic-grasp, pride - arrogance, excessive pride, false pride - false pride, because of that, it is to be abandoned, seekers - seekers, those who desire liberation.

Discussion

And this is not so, that is, even after a very long time, the knowledge of the subtle principle through reasoning has not been possible even through practice, therefore, this dry logic, which is the cause of wrong belief, should be abandoned by the seeker who truly desires liberation from the terrible, fearsome planet of the cycle of birth and death, the planet of dry logic. Because, this dry logic is truly dry! It has no taste or moisture, only a dry, heartless, and argumentative battle of tactics. Just as no oil can be extracted from a stick, no matter how much you grind it, similarly, no essence of truth can be extracted from dry logic, no matter how much you analyze and dissect it. And the seeker desires only that truth. Why would he be attracted to such dry, tasteless logic? Moreover, this planet of dry logic is truly a planet! As mentioned earlier, a planet is a ghost, or an evil planet, or a crocodile. (1) Just as someone possessed by a ghost, who has been entangled by it, experiences tremors and finds it difficult to escape from the ghost, similarly, someone possessed by this dry logic, who has been consumed by it, suffers greatly and finds it difficult to escape from its clutches. (2) Or, someone afflicted by an evil planet of sin suffers intense pain, similarly, someone afflicted by this evil planet of logic suffers intense torment inflicted by their own mind, and they cannot easily escape its influence. (3) Or, someone caught by a crocodile finds it extremely difficult to escape its jaws; similarly, someone caught by the planet of dry logic finds it extremely difficult to escape its clutches. Thus, in all three ways, the seeker of truth suffers due to the planet of dry logic. Why would a seeker of truth, who desires liberation, embrace such an evil, harmful planet of dry logic?

Furthermore, this planet of dry logic is great, extremely powerful, and terrifying. Its consequences are terrible for both the seeker and others. Because, due to the joy and anger of reasoning, the debater and the opponent both suffer. As the great scholar, Shri Siddhasen Divakarji, has described in his characteristic style, whoever wins in any way, becomes arrogant, transgresses boundaries, boasts, and disturbs everyone! And whoever is defeated by another, becomes angry, attacks the opponent with harsh words and insults, and in doing so, destroys himself. 

Page #511:
---------------------------
**Dimadrusti** makes the seeker free from all attachments. (45) It removes all kinds of disputes. It cannot tolerate any kind of debate or discussion, and it sighs deeply with anger due to insult! Even in pleasant things, it experiences **arati-jwar** – it does not like pleasant things, and its words towards friends are as harsh as stones! And it arises from **ahankara** (ego), this all-pervading principle is the principle of all systems, it seems to be mounted on it and truly examines itself! That is, it directly experiences the suffering caused by ego!” Thus, dry logic leads to a terrible outcome. Moreover, dry logic leads to **mithyabhiman** (false pride). A dry logician considers his father to be very intelligent! He is very proud of his father's intelligence and reasoning ability. He keeps boasting about how he cleverly tricked and defeated someone!

Thus, dry logic, which leads to a terrible outcome, leads to **mithyabhiman**, and therefore, it is completely to be abandoned by seekers of liberation. Because the true seekers have only one goal, to get rid of the bondage of birth and death at any cost. They have only one purpose, they are not interested in honor, worship, achievement, respect, etc., and as seen above, dry logic does not lead to any kind of self-interest, on the contrary, it causes great harm due to ego. Where is the solitude of a true seeker of liberation, and where is the solitude of a dry logician? “The good is on one side, and the debaters or the bull-like debaters are thinking on the other side! The sage has never said that debate is a good remedy.” Thus, there is a vast distance between debate and liberation, so why should a seeker of liberation engage in debate? Why should he embrace dry logic?

*"If he wins, he becomes arrogant, breaking the bounds of courtesy. He makes even the three worlds into wicked people by his boasting about his own virtues. Or if he loses, he becomes angry and quarrelsome. He attacks with a roar, making fun of the opponent. He cannot tolerate debaters, he sighs deeply with anger due to insult. Even in pleasant things, he experiences **arati-jwar**, and even towards friends, his words are like stones." This is the principle of all systems, that suffering arises from ego. And he, mounted on it, truly examines himself."*
*Shri Siddhasena Divakarcharita, 8, 15-18*

*"The good is on one side, and the bull-like debaters are thinking on the other side. The sage has never said that debate is a good remedy."*

**Domadashti Mahajan** (the great ones) should be followed on the path, with care and compassion.
(437) The path of the **Mahtapurusha** (great souls) is the right path because it is so.
Therefore, in this matter, the wise should follow the path of the great ones, without transgressing it, and act according to righteousness. 149
Meaning: Therefore, in this matter, the wise should follow the path of the great ones, without transgressing it, and act according to righteousness.
The wise **Mumukshu** (seeker of liberation) should abandon all other distractions, discard all other **Mahajan** (great ones) and their teachings, and follow the path of the **Mahtapurusha** (great souls) with complete surrender.
The path of the **Mahajan** (great ones) is the path of **Atmavisuddhi** (self-purification). Therefore, it is the duty of the **Mumukshu** (seeker of liberation) to follow in their footsteps. While walking on this path, one should avoid transgressing, violating, or breaking the **Dharmamarg** (path of righteousness) established by the **Mahtapurusha** (great souls).

Commentary
‘Poshahar: puchhyaay, papaacha papiwanam’ - Nyasaji.
This is the great man’s request, as he has said here. In this world, even subtle harm to others should be avoided, and in their welfare, one should always strive.
::
In this world, one should strive with effort to avoid even subtle harm to other beings, even subtle transgression. This is the duty of a seeker of liberation. A seeker of liberation avoids even subtle harm to other beings, let alone greater harm! One should remain constantly aware, through mind, speech, or body, that one does not cause any harm or transgression to any being.
Anushadhe aatma phlay, jinavarni tyah nahi aajnaay;

##  The Proper Worship of Gurudev-Dvijayati

(439) A seeker of liberation should always strive to benefit others.  A seeker should always actively engage in actions that benefit other beings in this world and the next, using their body, mind, and wealth to the best of their ability.  Thus, a seeker is compassionate and devoted to the welfare of others.

**And**

"Guru, Devatas, Vipras, and Tapasvi Yatis who are rich in austerities, are all great souls who should be worshipped with a sincere heart." (151)

**Meaning:** Gurus, Devatas, Vipras, and Tapasvi Yatis who are rich in austerities - all these great souls are worthy of worship with a sincere heart.

**Discussion:** Gurus, Devatas, Vipras, and Tapasvi Yatis who are rich in austerities - all these great souls are worthy of worship with a sincere heart.  Gurus include mothers, fathers, art teachers, their relatives - brothers, sisters, etc., as well as elders who teach Dharma, Devatas, and other teachings, those who are knowledgeable and elderly.  These noble people are the category of Gurus who are worthy of worship.  Their worship should be done in the following ways:

(1)  Bow to them three times a day, and when the opportunity arises, bow to them with utmost devotion in your heart.
(2)  When they arrive, greet them with respect, i.e., stand up and go to meet them, offer them a seat, and when they sit down, offer them water, etc.  Behave with humility in their presence.  Do not speak loudly in their presence.  Do not listen to gossip about them.
(3)  Offer them the best clothes, etc., to the best of your ability, and always serve them.
(4)  Refrain from any actions that are harmful to them, and engage in actions that are beneficial to them.  Do this with propriety, i.e., do not cause them any pain.

**Meaning:**  These qualities - mothers, fathers, Devatas, Vipras, and Yatis who are rich in austerities - are all worthy of worship.  They are great souls who should be worshipped with a sincere heart.  This means that they should be worshipped with a devoted heart, with a heart that is obedient to their teachings.

"The abandonment of what is harmful to them, and the engagement in what is beneficial to them, is what is called propriety, and it is said that Dharma should not cause pain."

To abstain from the undesirable and to engage in the desirable, and to perform the Dharma-adi Purushartha, and to eat what is produced, not to do so, but to remain devoted to the worship of Purushartha. (5) To enjoy its asana-adi, that is, not to use the Guru's asana-adi. And to allocate its wealth to Tirtha, that is, to use it in the sacred place, not to do so, it will itself accept it, it will have the opportunity for permission in its death-adi. (6) As well as to perform the rites of worship of its image, such as incense and flowers. And to perform its supreme and excellent upward ceremony, to perform the funeral rites.
To worship the gods with flowers, with ali, with clothes, and with shawls and mantras, with cleanliness and faith, etc., to worship the Guru-deva appropriately.

**Mahi: Mahat Purusha ne Maag, Upsanhar**
(44) **Artha** - And even towards those who are extremely sinful, who are extremely afflicted by their own karma, compassion is the only justice - this is the highest Dharma.
**Vivechan** "Shantinath Bhagwan Prasad, Rajchandra Karunae Siddha" - Shrimad Rajchandraji
And even towards those who are extremely sinful, who are extremely afflicted by their own karma, compassion is the only justice - this is the highest Dharma.
For a Mumukshu, compassion for all beings is a given, what is there to ask? But
Even towards Mahapaapi beings like hunters, fishermen, etc., compassion is the only justice - it is just. It is not appropriate to have a disdainful attitude towards them, because
These poor, ignorant beings have fallen into great sins due to their ignorance, they have become fallen, and they are extremely afflicted by their own evil karma. What is the point of killing the already dead? "To strike the fallen"? These poor sinners are the very place of compassion, of mercy. Thinking about the terrible fate that these six beings will suffer due to their evil karma, the Mumukshu will feel compassion for them. And motivated by this, he will try to prevent them from doing so, as much as he can. This is the highest Dharma.
"Tulsi Daya Na Chhandie, Jab Lag Ghat Mein Pran." - Tulsidasji
"Parahit Ae J Nit Hit Samjhu, Ane.
Par Dukha Ae Pota Nu Dukha Samjhu." "Prabhu Bhaje, Niti So, Partho Par Pakar." - Shrimad Rajchandraji
Thus, (1) Compassion for others, (2) Addiction to helping others, (3) Worship of Gurudev, (4) Compassion even for sinners - this is the highest Dharma. This is the path of the Mahat Purusha. This highest Dharma has been practiced by the Mahajanas, it has been shown, following it is the only righteous conduct.

##  Gadasya Samuchaya
(42) - Concluding, it is said - 
कृतमत्र प्रसंगेन प्रकृतं प्रस्तुमोऽधुना । तत्पुनः पञ्चमी तावद्योगदृष्टिमहोदया ॥ १५३ ॥  
Sarna atra prasangathi, have kahane prastut; te te panchmi ghani, dasti mahodaya yukta, 153

**Meaning:** Here, the occasion has been fulfilled. Now we present the main topic; and that main topic is the fifth, the great, the Yoga-drsti.

**Commentary:** All that has been said above was said due to the occasion. Therefore, this is enough! There is no need to say more. The wise will understand it in their own way. Therefore, the true seeker, the discerning one, will understand everything from this. A little has been said, but you will know a lot.” So now we present the main topic - the ongoing discussion. And that topic is the fifth, the "Sthira" named Yoga-drsti. And how special is it? It is great. Therefore, O seeker, O yogi! Abandoning all attachments, crossing the limits of the four drstis, now listen with one-pointed mind to the story of Yoga related to this "Suyash" nectar-pouring, fifth "Sthira" drsti!

Abhinivesh sagale tyajiji, char lahi jhene dasti te leshe have panchmiji, suyash amrut ghan vrusti
Manmohan jinji! Mithi tahari vanu - "Shri ye, da, saza 4-23

**Kritti-sh-** Sufficient, enough, **tra-** here in the context, **kan-** due to the occasion, **ka prastuno dhapuna-** now we say the main topic (ongoing discussion), **tapunah-** again, that main topic is, **vanneri tavaladashti-** the fifth, the "Sthira" named. How special is it? Therefore, it is said - **motha-** great, **mahodaya wali-** great, the ultimate liberation, that is the meaning.

##  **Fourth Insight:**

**Fourth Insight Table:** 10

| Name | In Fourth Insight |  Neath |  Vision |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deep-Light** |  **Deep-Light** |  **Deep-Light** |  **Deep-Light** |
| **Asanga** |  **Asanga** |  **Asanga** |  **Asanga** |
| **Bodhi** |  **Bodhi** |  **Bodhi** |  **Bodhi** |
| **Ganga** |  **Ganga** |  **Ganga** |  **Ganga** |
| **Dasa-Tyaga** |  **Dasa-Tyaga** |  **Dasa-Tyaga** |  **Dasa-Tyaga** |
| **Guna-Praapti** |  **Guna-Praapti** |  **Guna-Praapti** |  **Guna-Praapti** |
| **Visishta** |  **Visishta** |  **Visishta** |  **Visishta** |
| **Guna-Sthan** |  **Guna-Sthan** |  **Guna-Sthan** |  **Guna-Sthan** |

**Description:**

**Bodhi** is not gross or subtle.

**Ganga:**  **Bhaava** (feeling) **Praanayama** (breath control) - **Rechaka** (exhalation) - **Pooraka** (inhalation) - **Kumbhaka** (retention) - **Parabhaava** (external feeling) is **rayed** away, **Aatma-Bhaava** (inner feeling) is **purified** and **stabilized**.

**Dasa-Tyaga:**  **Uththaana** (arising) **Dasa-Tyaga** (abandonment of the ten) - Due to **Prashanta-Vaahita** (peaceful flow), there is no **Ulyaan-Dasa** (arising of the ten) in the **Yuga** (era).

**Guna-Praapti:**  **Tattva-Shravana** (hearing of the truth) - **Dharma-Sharan-Beejoha-Asabhakti** (non-attachment to the seed of refuge in Dharma) - **Teerthankara-Shana-Nirvana** (Nirvana of the Teerthankara).

**Visishta:**  **Asanvedya** (imperceptible) **Pada** (state) **Jay** (victory) - **Vishama** (uneven) **Kataka-Praha** (cutting of the knot) **Nivritti** (cessation).

**Guna-Sthan:**  **First Guna-Sthan** - The **excellence** of the first **Guna-Sthan** - The **last** **limit** is **achieved** here.

**Summary:**

The essence of the **Fourth Insight** is like a **lamp** that illuminates, as its name suggests. The fourth limb of **Yoga**, **Praanayama**, is achieved. The fourth **Chitta-Dasa** (state of mind), **Uththaana**, is destroyed, and the fourth **Guna** (quality), **Tattva-Shravana**, is attained. However, subtle **Neath** (subterfuge) is still present.

The **Praanayama** here is based on **Bhaava** (feeling). It involves **Rechaka** (exhalation) to **ray** away external feelings, **Pooraka** (inhalation) to **fill** with internal feelings, and **Kumbhaka** (retention) to **stabilize** them with the quality of **stability**. This is **Bhaava** (feeling) **Praanayama**.

A **Yogi** with this insight considers **Dharma** (righteousness) as the **supreme** **guide**, even more than **life**. They will sacrifice their life for **Dharma**, but they will not sacrifice **Dharma** for their life. This is their **firm** **resolve**.

(44)
From Vagdaripura, this ever-benevolent seeker, eager for Tattvasravana, embraces Dharma, which is more precious than life itself, with utmost devotion. Just as a seed sprouts from sweet water, leaving behind salty water, so too, Tattvakriti sprouts in a man, leading him to liberation. Here, the entire worldly existence is like salty water, and Tattvasruti is like the sweet water that nourishes it. Thus, through Tattvakriti, a human being attains all well-being, which is filled with the joy of Guru Bhakti and beneficial in both worlds. This Guru Bhakti inspires the vision of Tirthankaras, which is a cause of Nirvana, free from the distinctions of Samaptti, etc.
“Tattvasravana is like sweet water, here the seed of liberation sprouts;
Leaving behind the salty water of worldly existence, Guru Bhakti is unwavering.” - Manmohan.
However, the reason for mentioning the negation of subtle bonds here is that without Samyakta, they cannot be broken. Both are experienced through the Vedya-Sanvedya state, and they do not occur in the Avedya-Sanvedya state. Vedya refers to the object of knowledge, the binding cause, and the Vedya-Sanvedya state is where it always exists. Therefore, the Tattvanirnaya that occurs in the Viddh Samaj, due to the distinctions of Samyakta, etc., is called Sukshma Bandha. This Sukshma Bandha does not yet exist in this state, because in the first four states, the Avedya-Sanvedya state is dominant, and the Vedya-Sanvedya state is like the shadow of a bird, a reflection of the activity of aquatic creatures, unreal and illusory. And the Avedya-Sanvedya state is the ultimate truth, the state of Yogis is the Vedya-Sanvedya state. Because where there is pure and uncontaminated activity of the intellect, free from the influence of the knowledge of women, etc., through the proper perception and various types of knowledge, that state is worthy of the name "state" due to its proper state. This Vedya-Sanvedya state is characterized by detachment from the world, etc. This Nitya Vedya-Sanvedya state belongs only to the permanent Samyak Darshan. And due to its great influence, even if some activity occurs in sin due to the transgression of karma, it is like stepping on a hot ember, meaning that just as one immediately retracts one's foot from a hot ember, so too, this Samyak Darshan immediately feels the shock of sin, it does not have a long-lasting state, and this sinful activity is the last one. Because the firm Samyak Darshan does not lead a man to further degradation, like a king.
“That state, through the separation of knots, the last sinful activity,
Like stepping on a hot ember, there is an end to liberation.” - Manmohan.
In contrast to that is the Avedya-Sanvedya state. And just as a diamond is impenetrable, so too, that state belongs to the Bhava-Abhinandi Jiva. This Bhava-Abhinandi is petty, greedy, humble, envious, fearful, rotten,

The Essence of Homedasti Homaasti
(445) Ignorance and a futile beginning are always companions. Such a person, devoid of knowledge and understanding, is pierced and overwhelmed by the consequences of wrong actions, resulting in a mixed state that is not beautiful. Therefore, such a person, with a mind clouded by ignorance, is prone to reversals and blind to the distinction between good and bad in the present moment. Despite witnessing the manifest suffering of the world, they remain attached to it due to excessive delusion and do not experience distress or weariness. They remain entangled in worldly attachments, and their inert nature binds their soul with the dust of sin. Even though they have received the seed of the supreme Dharma, the form of human existence, in the field of karma, these people of limited intellect do not strive to cultivate this seed through virtuous actions. Instead, they become engrossed in trivial and harmful pleasures, abandoning righteous conduct and virtuous behavior. Alas! Such people deserve condemnation! This state of ignorance is a path to degradation and downfall, and it can only be overcome through the guidance of great souls, the scriptures, and the company of the righteous. It is impossible to achieve this through any other means.

“The life of such a person, devoid of knowledge, is like a hard rock,
Only through the company of the righteous, the scriptures, and the guidance of great souls can they be softened... captivating the mind.”

Even when this state of ignorance persists, the human mind is naturally protected from harmful and illogical arguments. These arguments are like a snare, a source of suffering, a destroyer of faith, and a generator of pride. Thus, such arguments are a clear enemy of the mind, causing harm in various ways. Therefore, those seeking liberation should not be attached to such harmful and illogical arguments, but rather focus on virtuous actions, good conduct, meditation, and compassion. All alternatives are associated with ignorance, and these arguments are their plan. What is the purpose of them? Moreover, all such arguments are based on speculation, illusory perceptions, and influenced by personal opinions. Just as one might wonder whether a running elephant will strike the one who is far away or the one who is near, so too are these arguments. Many other types of errors arise from such arguments. Therefore, what is the purpose of such harmful and illogical arguments?

Wise beings strive to achieve the knowledge of the subtle realities, and these subtle realities are never accessible through mere intellectual reasoning but only through the scriptures. Therefore, those who are devoted to the scriptures, righteous conduct, and meditation, and who are engaged in the practice of yoga, are aware of these subtle realities. In the same way, the great sage Patanjali has said, “Through the scriptures, inference, and direct experience, a person attains the highest truth.”

There are many who hold different opinions about the truth, but those who consider them to be different are mistaken.

The collection of Gadasti is great for the extremely devoted. Because the name Sarvagna, which is truly transcendental, is one and the same in essence, despite individual differences. Therefore, those who have the belief and understanding of Sarvagna in general, are all considered to have attained him, and this is an undeniable truth. And since he is not fully known by all Asavadasis, those who, in general, are devoted to Sarvagna with a selfless and sincere heart, are considered to be close to him in that measure, like many servants of a king. There is another point here - devotion to God is of two types - Chitra and Achitra. The devotion of those who are worldly is of the Chitra type, because their nature is of the Chitra type, and their devotion is filled with attachment, leading to affection for their favorite deity and hatred for the disliked deity. But the devotion of those who are liberated from the world, is Achitra, and due to the absence of doubt, it is only Shamasara - Shampradhan.
“Not all are his servants,
Devotion to God is also said to be Chitra and Achitra, illuminating the mind.”
Similarly, even in the same practice, the fruit is different according to the intention, and that intention is paramount here, like water in agriculture. This intention is also of many types, depending on the intensity of ragadi and the difference in buddhi, jnana, etc., because there are three types: (1) buddhi, (2) jnana, (3) asanmeha. All actions are different because of these. The buddhi that relies on action is buddhi, the one that is based on scripture is jnana, and the one that is accompanied by good practice is asanmeha. Respect, affection, non-violence, acquisition of wealth, curiosity, service to knowledgeable people, and grace towards them are the characteristics of good practice. All actions of beings are generally done with buddhi, and due to the effect of karma, they are the cause of worldly results. The actions of a Kulagi are done with jnana, and due to the inclusion of the power of Shruti, which is like nectar, they are the cause of liberation, and the actions that arise from asanmeha, due to their pure nature, quickly give the fruit of liberation. This asanmeha karma is only for those who are beyond the world, who are not bound by karma, and who are seeking liberation.
“Buddhi action gives worldly results, jnana action is the limb of Shiva;
Asanmeha action gives the fruit of liberation quickly.”
Here, in the natural emotions - the creation of karmic pudgala, the mind that is not eager is called bha...

## Deepraani: Essence of Vaadrusti (447)

The liberated soul is a future inhabitant of the liberated state. Their path is one, the path of renunciation, and despite differences in stages, it is one, like the arrows on the shore of the ocean. Because the principle beyond the worldly existence is called 'Nirvana', it is one in essence, despite differences in words. Sadashiva, Parabrahma, Siddhatma, and other such words refer to the same one. Because it is free from the conflict of attributes, it is free from suffering, free from disease, and inactive. This principle is beyond the reach of birth and death. Therefore, when the seeker, through their lack of understanding, fails to recognize this principle of Nirvana, their devotion is filled with conflict. And this principle of Nirvana is inherently established. How can there be differences in the knowledge of this all-knowing, pure Nirvana, which is the closest goal? And if there is no knowledge, then how can their devotees be liberated?

**The seeker's one path**
**The principle of Nirvana is one**
**How can there be differences?**

**"The structure of the karmic matter is there, where the mind is not absorbed; the path is one, that of Shiva, the world is full of differences...mind"**

Then, one might wonder, how can there be differences in the knowledge of the liberated souls? The solution is that the knowledge is of different types, depending on the disciple's capacity and suitability. Because these liberated souls, who have overcome the cycle of birth and death, teach in a way that is suitable for the individual, based on their karmic tendencies and other factors. Or, another reason is that, although the knowledge is one, it appears different due to the differences in the listeners, because of their varying levels of merit and ability. And this also benefits everyone, according to their individual capacity and understanding. Or, it is because of the influence of time and space, that the knowledge appears different, depending on the perspective of the sage who is teaching. And the essence of this sage's knowledge is ultimately the same, all-knowing. Therefore, it is not appropriate to oppose or contradict the knowledge of the liberated souls without understanding their perspective. Because such opposition is ultimately harmful. Therefore, it is not appropriate to engage in debates and arguments about this all-knowing subject, like a shadow in the form of a debate. Therefore, the seeker who is eager for liberation should completely abandon the dry, intellectual pursuit of knowledge, which is born out of false pride. The seeker should not be attached to the pursuit of knowledge, because it is ultimately irrelevant. Because even the principles of Dharma have to be abandoned in the pursuit of liberation, then what is the point of this trivial, dry, intellectual pursuit?

**Explanation of the differences in knowledge**
**Intellectual pursuit**
**Abandonment**

**"Even Dharma, forgiveness, etc., are abandoned, the Dharma of renunciation is revealed; then what is the use of arguments for the ignorant, what is the use of study for the sage?...mind"**

Therefore, the Gadsi community should properly follow the path of the great men, and the discerning should act righteously without transgression. This is the path of the great men, in brief: (1) Here, even subtle suffering should be avoided with effort, (2) Always strive for the welfare of others, (3) Worship the great ones - the Guru, the Deities, the learned Brahmins, and the ascetic Yatis - with a sincere mind, as appropriate, (4) Even towards those great sinners who are extremely afflicted by the karma of their fathers, have utmost compassion - not envy. This is the highest Dharma.

And so on, having attained these virtues, one who abandons all wrong views and attains the four visions, will now attain the fifth vision, like a shower of nectar.
“Abandoning all wrong views, having attained the four visions; one will now attain the fifth, a shower of nectar of fame.
...O charming Jinendra! Sweet is your speech.” Thus says Sakzaya.
Yoga-darshan Kalash Kavya
: Shalini: In the lamp, what is the light that illuminates? It is the illumination of the mind that shines; through Pranayama, it fills the self, and through love, it attains the knowledge of the truth. 57
Through outward breath, it expels outward, through inward breath, it draws inward; the Yogi considers it stable through Kumbhaka, thus is Pranayama through love. 58
Pranayama is complete in this state, Dharma is considered greater than even life, one abandons life for the sake of Dharma, one does not abandon Dharma for the sake of life. 59
True love is the only Dharma, it goes beyond death; everything else burns, it merges into ashes with the body. 60
With such a deep understanding of Dharma, one becomes eager for the knowledge of the truth; one says that Dharma is greater than even life, one embraces it with devotion. 61
Just as one leaves salty water and drinks sweet water, just as a sprout emerges from a seed, in the same way, through the influence of the knowledge of the truth, the seed of Yoga sprouts. 62
Just as salty water is like the world, the knowledge of the truth is like sweet water, all good things are obtained from it, the happiness of devotion to the Guru is obtained. 63
Through the influence of devotion to the holy Guru, one attains the darshan of the Tirtha Swami; through meditation, one attains the state of liberation, one aims for Nirvana. 64

**Chapter: The Nature of the Soul**

(49) The sub-species is not here, the capable one is here, it is not the Veda-sensitive state, it is not the Veda-sensitive state, it is the non-Veda-sensitive state that is seen. 65 The one who abides in the non-Veda-sensitive state, the wise one quickly crosses it; and that is the karma-like differentiation, the whole Veda is from the essence. 66 This non-Veda-sensitive state, by its influence, never causes sinful activity; and if there is sinful activity, it is the activity of the state of destruction. 67 The one who abides in the non-Veda-sensitive state, is very happy with the feeling of detachment; therefore, the last sinful activity, there is no activity of the hellish state. 68 In the absence of this non-Veda-sensitive state, the Veda-sensitive state is present; there is no subtle difference in the essence, but there is a difference in the state. 69 It is not the essence, it is the "state" that is non-Veda-sensitive, it is the state of the soul, it is the Veda-sensitive state, the "state" is the true one, and the form of the knot, etc., is examined. 70 The non-Veda-sensitive state is the opposite of that, the vessel of the soul is from that; it is not the result of the non-existent, just as poisonous food is not good. 71 Therefore, the non-Veda-sensitive one who is opposite, is blind in the discrimination of good and bad; who has seen this sweet poison? The mind is deluded by such thoughts. 72 The world is seen to be suffering from birth, etc., it is not seen to be happy! The evil deed is a deed, the non-deed is a deed, it appears - it is the evil deed that binds itself. 73 The seed of Dharma is sown in the field of karma, the foolish one does not cultivate good karma; the seed sprouts and grows, the inert one abandons the effort, it is all true. 74 This non-Veda-sensitive blindness is bad, it is the one that puts one in hell; one conquers it with the speed of good creation, with the good company of the right scriptures. 75 And this is conquered by the rule, by the soul itself, by the essence; the wrong argument is abandoned, the one who is attached to it is harmed. 76 This is all, the wise one, the one who has faith, the one who is proud; the wrong argument is directly in many ways, it is always heavy on the mind. 77 Therefore, the wrong argument is not appropriate, meditation, conduct, and effort are appropriate; charity is also pure - the one who walks on it, the other is also accomplished. 78 The seeker of liberation is devoted to the scriptures, he is eager in yoga, he is virtuous; he knows the object that is beyond the senses, he attains the highest essence by the power of wisdom. 79

Idravansha (Vanshastha)
The omniscient is not different from the essence, the devotee believes in the difference due to delusion; what the omniscient truly is, is one and the same even in individual differences. It is the same as the common essence, the diamond is the same for all;
A king's servant, many, even with different appointments, all die. 81 The omniscient is true essence, without difference, the omniscient believer does not have difference here; the object of worship is one, even among the worshippers, there is no difference in conduct. 82 The omniscient is great for all, truly! Therefore, there is no difference from the essence in the end; the difference in names etc. may be there, the right-minded great soul should have this feeling. 83
The devotion of Shalini, Chitra, Chitra, which is described in the scriptures, therefore, this thing is confirmed, the unity of all is established. Those who are worldly, who go to the divine body, they have devotion to the worldly divine; those who go to the transcendental meaning, they have devotion to that essence. 85 The devotion of the worldly divine is a picture, with its passion and other hatred, and the transcendental is without a picture, devotion is pure for all worldly beings. The place of the worldly divine is a picture, the state etc. are all strange in every way; therefore, the means are a picture, the paths are different, the destination is not a picture. There is a difference in the intention, therefore, there is a difference in the fruits, the intention and the purpose are the main here, just as water is in agriculture. The enjoyers take the essence here, their intentions are different; according to the intensity of passion etc., and according to the difference in understanding etc., understanding, knowledge and non-duality, the scriptures have spoken of three types of difference; according to this difference, all beings, they experience the difference in the essence. Idri understanding is the one that relies on, it is according to knowledge and scriptures; and the knowledge that is combined with right action, it has been given the name "unwavering". Great respect and love for the giver, the acquisition of wealth without obstacles is good; inquiry and service to the expert, know it by the signs of the knowledgeable! 92 The actions of all intelligent beings, they all lead to worldly fruits; according to the scriptures and where, the consequences are the inheritance here. 93:

Hi; Kalasa Kavya
(451) And the karmas that you see with knowledge! They are the cause of the entire cycle of births and deaths; just as nectar-like knowledge-power influences, so does the true self, connected with it, obtain it. 94 If it is done without doubt, then it gives the blessed state of liberation quickly; if it is directed towards the true essence, transcending the world, then it is the master of attainment through pure oneness. 5 Whose mind is not attached to worldly things, who is detached from worldly enjoyments; such a liberated soul, who is self-absorbed, is directed towards the true essence, transcending the world. 96 Such saints have only one path, "Kshaitimo" is the only true path; there are many different states of being, just as there is no need for an arrow in the ocean. 97 That essence, transcending the world, is called liberation, it is the essence of all; it is one with the true essence, even though there are different words like Siddhatma, etc. 98 This liberation essence, through the true essence, is attained with certainty, and in its devotion, the wise person does not have any doubt, see! 99 And liberation is preceded by omniscience, liberation is preceded by omniscience, all this omniscience is the path to liberation, so how can there be any difference? 100 The picture of the country of all, spoken for the benefit of the disciple, just as the seed of the banyan tree sprouts, so does it sit in the womb of birth. 101 The picture appears differently according to the listener, the power of merit is like that! It benefits all the noble ones, and in this way, it remains eternal. 102 And the picture of the country of the sage is seen in relation to time, etc.; and its value is known by the omniscient, like a drop in the ocean of omniscient words. 103 Without knowing the intention behind it, rejecting it is not appropriate; to call this a bad word is more like a lie. 104 Omniscience, etc., is beyond all this, without knowledge, it is decided, and therefore, here, people like the blind, have nothing to do with debate. 105
Dry, barren, and harsh, the planets, the sun, the great heat, the false ego, the seeker of liberation should abandon this. 106 The planets are everywhere in the true essence, they do not diminish for the seeker of liberation; even in liberation, they are there, so what is the point of them here? 107

The Gadashti Samuchi Vaitaliya here, the Self is the only eternal one, and Dharma is the only eternal one; worship that eternal Dharma, and you will attain the eternal path. Abandon the 108 opinions and philosophies, and follow the path of the true saints and sages; become devoted to truth, and cultivate a compassionate mind. 109 Avoid harming others, and always be grateful; worship the Guru and other revered ones, and be compassionate towards the wicked. 110 The desire for worldly things is poison, and the nectar of equanimity is the antidote; the abode of mental joy will be attained, and the devotee of the Lord will attain immortality. 111

## Steady Vision

This is the fifth type of vision, called "Steady Vision". It is described as follows:

**Verse 154:** "In steady vision, the sight is always present and accompanied by withdrawal. The action is unwavering, pure, and imbued with subtle knowledge."

**Meaning:** In steady vision, the sight is always present and accompanied by withdrawal. The action is unwavering, pure, and imbued with subtle knowledge.

**Commentary:** In steady vision, the sight is like a jewel, unwavering and subtle. It is accompanied by withdrawal.

**Explanation:** The fifth type of vision, called "Steady Vision", is characterized by unwavering sight, which is always present and not subject to change. In contrast, in the other types of vision, the sight is not always present and can be subject to change. This unwavering sight is accompanied by withdrawal, which is the ability to control the senses and prevent them from being distracted by external objects. This withdrawal is essential for achieving steady vision, as it allows the mind to focus on the object of sight without being disturbed by external stimuli.

The action that results from steady vision is also unwavering, pure, and imbued with subtle knowledge. This means that the action is not motivated by selfish desires or attachments, but by a deep understanding of the nature of reality. The action is also pure, meaning that it is free from any negative consequences. Finally, the action is imbued with subtle knowledge, meaning that it is guided by a deep understanding of the subtle workings of the universe.

In summary, steady vision is a state of mind that is characterized by unwavering sight, withdrawal, pure action, and subtle knowledge. It is a state of enlightenment that allows the individual to see the world clearly and act in a way that is beneficial to all beings.

There is a collection of six views. Here, in terms of the sequence of actions like veneration, etc., it is free from blemishes, free from faults and free from transgression; and that is why it is with great wisdom. Because, through the breaking of the knot, here the attainment of the Vedic knowledge is possible. Thus, according to the sequence mentioned earlier, here in the fifth view, (1) the vision is like the brilliance of a jewel, (2) the fifth limb of yoga, pratyahara, is attained, (3) the fifth mental fault named branti is destroyed, (4) the five qualities named bodha manifest.

The eternal vision: the steady view, like the brilliance of a jewel, is of two types - (1) free from transgression, (2) with transgression. The vision that occurs in the view free from transgression is eternal and unchanging, it remains as it is; and the vision that occurs in the view with transgression is impermanent, it undergoes change, it does not remain as it is.

This vision, this knowledge, is likened to the brilliance of a jewel, because the brilliance of a jewel is greater than the brilliance of a lamp, just as this knowledge is much greater than the fourth view, the view of the lamp. The brilliance of a lamp depends on external causes like oil, etc., "The lamp shines as long as there is oil, so it is considered unstable, but the brilliance of a jewel does not depend on such external causes, it is self-dependent, so it is steady, it never perishes. Similarly, this knowledge is self-dependent, it does not depend on any cause, it is not dependent on others, it is direct, and thus this knowledge, being self-dependent, direct, and an experience of the self, is steady, it never perishes. In it - (1) the knowledge in the steady view free from transgression is like the pure brilliance of a jewel, due to its purity, it is eternal, always steady, uniform, unchanging, it remains as it is. And (2) the knowledge in the steady view with transgression is like the brilliance of a jewel covered with dust, due to the transgression-like dustiness, it is impermanent, unstable, it does not remain uniform, it undergoes change according to the influx of karma. Just as dust, etc., fall on a jewel, and due to that dust, etc., its brilliance becomes unstable, fluctuating, the dustiness increases, but it does not perish from its root, so it remains steady, similarly, this knowledge, due to the transgression-like dust, becomes unstable, fluctuating, impermanent, it undergoes change according to the influx of karma, but it does not perish from its root, so it remains steady.

Just as someone's eye has been injured and it is healing, they do not feel the effect of the injury, etc., their eye does not appear very red anymore, they do not feel pain either, 

Page #531:
---------------------------
##  **The Radiant Jewel Lamp** (455)

Even though the eye disease has been cured, the eye still flickers due to the lingering effects of the past transgression.  The eye occasionally appears dim. Similarly, the eye disease of a person with *saatichaar* (transgression) has been cured, so they are unaware of the effects of their past actions, such as *ulkepa* (negative karma). They do not see the eye disease, nor do they experience the pain associated with it. However, due to the lingering effects of the transgression, their vision still fluctuates and weakens. Thus, in the *sthira* (stable) vision, there is instability and impermanence in the form of a decrease in the clarity of vision.  

Despite this, the *sthira* vision remains true to its name, stable and unwavering. Once attained, it never fades away. This established principle remains constant.  As mentioned earlier, the last four types of vision, including *sthira*, are unwavering.  

While the *sthira* vision is unwavering, how the vision attained in *niratichaar* (non-transgression) is eternal and unwavering, and how the vision attained in *saatichaar* (transgression) is impermanent and wavering, will be explained in detail later.

The vision that arises in this *sthira* vision is like the vision that emerges after the eye disease is cured. Just as the true vision of an object becomes clear when the eye disease is cured and the film over the eye is removed, similarly, in this *sthira* vision, the vision of the soul and body, which was obscured by the *aanadi* (beginningless) *mehsantaan* (delusion) and the *buddhi* (intellect) based eye disease, is revealed when the veil of delusion is removed.  The liberated soul immediately experiences the true nature of objects.  

Therefore, the *samyag darshi* (perfectly enlightened) person, who is the direct witness, experiences the knowledge of the true nature of self and objects. They understand that they are a pure, knowledge-filled, and eternally formless soul.  Nothing else, not even an atom, belongs to them. (See page 68)

**6. Experience**

The analogy of the *ratnadeepak* (jewel lamp) to this vision is truly apt.  

(1) Just as the *ratnadeepak* spreads a peaceful light and dispels darkness, similarly, the *samyag darshan* (perfect vision), like a jewel lamp, illuminates the mind palace with supreme peace, dispelling the darkness of ignorance.

(2) Just as there is no smoke or flickering in the *ratnadeepak*, similarly, when the *samyag darshan* jewel shines brightly, there is no trace of *kashya* (passions) like smoke, and the *charitra* (conduct) does not flicker.

(3) Just as the *ratnadeepak* does not lower its light, similarly, the *samyag darshan* jewel does not lower its light, meaning its recipient does not descend into degradation.

(4) The *ratnadeepak* may be hidden by the sun's rays, but the brilliance of the *samyag darshan* jewel is not obscured by the sun's light.

(5) The *ratnadeepak* is a lamp, but the *samyag darshan* jewel is not a lamp. It is the *ratnadeepak* itself, the radiant jewel lamp. 

Page #532:
---------------------------
(56)
The collection of *gadashti* remains stable, but the brilliance of this *samyagdarshan* jewel, which is "the brilliance of all brilliance," increases with the strength of experience and practice. (6) Just as a jewel lamp is not extinguished by the wind and does not become fickle or unstable, so this jewel lamp of *samyagdarshan* is not affected by the wind of attachment and does not become fickle or unstable. "The stability that cannot be shaken by household troubles or external dangers, that is the end." (See footnote p. 68). (7) Just as a jewel lamp always appears beautiful and does not become weak or thin, so this jewel lamp of *samyagdarshan* always appears beautiful and,
"With strong qualities, it never becomes weak or thin," it does not become thin, but rather becomes increasingly strong with the continuous strengthening of *atmadharma*. (8) Just as oil does not need to be poured into a jewel lamp and the "direction" or path does not burn, so in this jewel lamp of *samyagdarshan*, *pudgala* oil does not need to be poured, meaning there is no dependence on external influences, and the pure state of the self does not burn, "Because the pure state does not burn," meaning it remains in the pure state of the self. The poet *Yashavijayaji* has beautifully sung all these miraculous qualities derived from the metaphor of the jewel lamp in his immortal poem - "O friend, the *Jineshwar* is like a jewel lamp; yes, in the temple of my mind, the *ariyal* shines brightly." (See p. 69)
Similarly, just as the light of a jewel, this vision of *bodhi* is also (1) unopposed, (2) ever-increasing, (3) without a cause, (4) not a cause for others, (5) a cause for satisfaction, (6) the birthplace of knowledge, etc., (7) and supremely auspicious. (For clarification, see pp. 69-70). And so on, in many ways, this stable vision of *darshan* - *bodhi* is similar to the light of a jewel, their similarities cannot be diminished. The more we contemplate this metaphor, the more miraculous it appears, and it evokes a sense of awe and reverence for the words of the *jnani*. Here, a brief overview has been given. Contemplate it further with your own mind.
"The fifth limb of yoga - *pratyahara* - does not involve the senses with the objects of the senses, it is here in *pratyahara*." - *Sakzaya*, 6-4.
After the fourth limb of yoga, *pranayama*, is attained through vision, the fifth limb, called *pratyahara*, naturally arises. *Pratyahara* (prati + ahar) means to withdraw the senses from their objects. "When the senses are not attached to objects, 

Page #533:
---------------------------
**Steady Gaze:**  The restraint of the senses (pratyahara) is not the absence of the senses, but rather the non-attachment to the objects of the senses. 

(457)  Pratyahara is the imitation of the true nature of the mind (chitta).  This means that when the senses, such as the eyes, are not engaged with their respective objects, such as forms, they cease to be drawn towards them.  The senses withdraw from their objects, remaining in their own state, and this imitation of the true nature of the mind (chitta) provides the material for the restraint of the mind (chittanirodha).  This is called the restraint of the senses (pratyahara).  What kind of restraint is this?  It is a fruit-bearing restraint that subdues the senses.  Through the practice of pratyahara, the senses become so disciplined and obedient that they do not wander even when exposed to external objects.

In the fourth stage of the steady gaze, through pranayama, external emotions are expelled, internal emotions are cultivated, and their retention and stabilization are achieved.  Thus, the seeker who progresses on the path of yoga, their tendencies no longer play in external emotions, but rather culminate in internal emotions.  Therefore, with the attainment of this fifth stage, the seeker's senses no longer engage with their respective objects, and they withdraw from them, becoming restrained.  They become absorbed in internal activities, serving the mind's essence, and imitating the true nature of the mind.

The senses, which previously roamed freely like wild horses, now become disciplined, withdraw, and are bound to their own mental abode.  They abandon their outward tendencies, which were like mouths seeking objects, and become wise and introspective.  The eyes, which once saw external forms, now see the inner essence through feeling.  The ears, which once heard external sounds, now hear the inner sound.  The nose, which once enjoyed external fragrances, now finds satisfaction in the fragrance of feeling.  The tongue, which once relished external tastes, now delights in the taste of inner consciousness.  The body, which once found pleasure in external touch, now experiences joy in the touch of the essence of consciousness.  Thus, the external tendencies of the senses cease, and the internal tendencies, which are in the form of feeling, prevail.  Because the five senses, like unruly horses, are now controlled by the awakened soul.

* "The restraint of the senses is the knowledge that arises from the non-attachment to objects.  It is the state of being free from the desire for objects."
* "When the senses are not engaged with their respective objects, they imitate the true nature of the mind.  From this, the senses become restrained." - Shri Patanjali Yoga Sutras, 2-54-55.

Yoga-drishti-samurachya has come into the hands of a Chitta-sarathi, and thus, the unparalleled Chaitanya-rasa is experienced and savored with emotion, then the senses become subdued, they become as submissive as a poor cow, so that they no longer have any interest in external objects, and even when they are forcibly taken towards them, they do not go! Thus, it arranges this Chitta-ghar! Therefore, after savoring this Chaitanya-amrita-rasa, it does not desire the collection of Pudgala-bhega in the form of Bakas-bukas! - Thus, in this drishti, the darshan of the Samyag-drishti-purusha is necessarily accompanied by Pratyahara, because if Pratyahara is not truly an internal object-dispassion, then Samyag-drishti-panam will also not be present, therefore, the Samyag-drishti-purusha has extreme non-attachment towards objects, and only supreme dispassion prevails.
I will explain the other understanding of Bhrānti-desh-tyāga later, when the Chitta becomes stable. - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
After the Chitta-dosha named the fourth Uththāna is destroyed in the drishti, the fifth dosha named Bhrānti naturally disappears here. Because (1) there is such peaceful tranquility here, the Chitta flows in such an unbroken, continuous, calm stream, there is such a settled state of the Chitta that it does not rise from the Maekshasadhak-yugmarg-kriya. And how can the Chitta, which does not rise from its own place, become Bhrānti? How can it wander aimlessly? Therefore, the Chitta is Abhrānti here, it is stable. (2) Or, leaving the present activity, the Chitta's wandering, roaming, and fluctuating tendencies are Bhrānti. But here, due to calmness, Chitta-sthitirata prevails, therefore, such Bhrānti does not exist, only Abhrānti exists. (3) Or, to wander like the image in a shell, to have a Viparyas in the form of considering the Tatva as Atatva, is Bhrānti. But here, due to the true determination of the Tatva, such Viparyas-rupa Bhrānti does not exist, only Abhrānti prevails. (4) To not remember whether one has done a certain action or not, due to delusion, therefore, even from such auspicious actions, there is such a void in the Arthavidhi, the desired result, the Paramartha-karma, does not happen (see page 86). This is also Bhrānti. But here, in this drishti, due to the use of Samyam, the awakened Samyag-drishti-purusha does not experience such Bhrānti. Thus, due to calmness, due to being free from Viparyas, and due to being useful, the Chitta is Abhrānti in every way here - it is stable. Therefore, the actions of the Samyag-drishti-purusha, such as Vandanadi, are also Abhrānti, that is, he performs those actions without Bhrānti, while properly maintaining the Yakt-kram; he performs them with complete emotion, with supreme peace, with focused attention, and with a stable, absorbed use. For example,

## Steadfastness: Abandonment of Delusion, Attainment of Subtle Insight

**Steadfastness:** Abandonment of delusion, attainment of subtle insight.

**Pure intention, steadfast devotion to the Lord, those who chant your name, they attain the uninterrupted, infinite, supreme nectar-like abode.** - Shri Devchandraji.

Those who perform such acts of veneration, they truly preserve the place, time, and order, they use the words of the sutras according to their meaning, they do not cause confusion or distraction in others, and they chant the sutras in a proper tone that conveys faith and enthusiasm. And as they perform these acts of veneration, their feelings and emotions are pure, their intention is steadfast, their good intentions increase, and the purity of their prostrations and other acts of veneration is truly preserved through devotion to the Lord. Thus, their acts of veneration are free from any fault due to their non-attachment, non-direction, and non-blameworthiness. (See page 219-220)

Furthermore, these acts of veneration, repentance, etc., are accompanied by subtle insight. A person with right vision performs any action with a proper understanding of its essence; because they have a right understanding of the essence, they perform all actions with a calm mind, without any attachment, without any haste. Thus, the practice of steadfastness is pure in its attachment.

For example, a person with right vision performs devotion to the Lord with an understanding of the essence of devotion. They know that this Lord has attained the pure self-nature, therefore, they are worthy of my highest reverence. The nature of this Supreme Being is the nature of my own soul. Therefore, to attain the fullness of my pure self-essence, to achieve pure self-realization, this ideal form of the Lord, who is the object of my aspiration, is my ultimate goal, and I must strive to attain his supreme grace.

**(459)**

**"Having attained the pure nature, the Jina is therefore worthy of worship; the Jina's nature is the same as the essence of self-awareness."** - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi

**"My pure essence is fulfilled, you are the true goal, O Lord; Devchandraji, the sages, and all the devotees of the truth have experienced this."** - Shri Devchandraji

**Subtle Insight**

Here, the fifth quality of insight is revealed, because in the fourth vision, the quality of understanding the truth was revealed, and therefore, in this fifth vision, the quality of insight naturally manifests as a consequence. And this insight is also subtle here. Because here, due to the breaking of the knot, there is attainment of the object of knowledge, and it is in this object of knowledge that subtle insight arises. This has been explained in detail in the previous section on the right of the object of knowledge in the fourth vision, but let us briefly reiterate it with feeling. Its characteristic was described as follows:

**Understanding the essence of the goal and the different aspects of the goal with wisdom.** 

Page #536:
---------------------------
(460)
The subtle knowledge is that which, through the Vedya-Sanvedya-pad in the society, determines the truth, and the ultimate purpose is achieved. And the skill of this knowledge in crossing the ocean of existence is its subtlety, or its sharpness in differentiating the weight of karma is its subtlety, or its comprehensive and skillful acceptance of the infinite Dharma-atma-samagra vastu-tattva is its subtlety. Thus, in many ways, the subtlety of this knowledge is revealed. (See 65-66, Vivechan p. 261-266)
Here, the Vedya-Sanvedya-pad is attained. That is, where the Vedya-Sanvedaniya object is perceived according to the state of the object, that is the Vedya-Sanvedya-pad. That is, the object like woman, etc., which is the cause of the giving, etc., is perceived here through the arrival, in its true form, as pure and pure, and in this way, by the non-active intellect. That is, the experience of woman, etc., is always the object of existence, therefore it is to be abandoned, it is to be abandoned, such a decisive intellect arises in the soul. (See - Lai. 7075, Vivechan p. 272-291) And the pure knower-natured soul, with the characteristics of knowledge, vision, and character, is the only one that is to be accepted, the rest is to be abandoned, such an unbroken conviction is revealed in the soul. The experience that the pure soul has is the enjoyment of its own time, and where the shadow of the influence of the pudgala karma-pradesh falls, that is the dwelling of the other time, thus the object is revealed here.
Pure experience is always the enjoyment of one's own time, and the shadow that falls on the other side is the dwelling of the other time -
"Dharma is the supreme lord." - Shri Anandghanji.
Just as a sword from a sheath, the soul is different from the body, etc., it is always useful and imperishable, knowing this from the teachings of the Sadguru, the correct perception arises here, the feeling of the soul's true form is felt. Without understanding this innate soul-form, that is, without knowing and perceiving it, the soul had suffered endlessly before, this soul-form "pad" is explained by Shri Sadguru Bhagwan, now this soul is experienced, it is directly known by self-awareness, and that is the Vedya-Sanvedya-pad.
"From the teachings of the Sadguru, such an unprecedented awareness; the own pad in the own, ignorance is removed." - Shrimad Rajchandraji
Shri Atmasiddhi and this experience of the soul-form or the Vedya-Sanvedya-pad is the "pad" in the true sense of the word, because where one can stand firmly, 

Page #537:
---------------------------
**Steady Vision:** All actions in the cycle of birth and death appear like the play of a child in a dust-house.

(461) Only that which has a stable and correct state of being can be called a "pad." And this experience of the true nature of the self, being the nature of the "pad" that is perceived by the "pad-vedya" (the one who knows the "pad"), is of a correct state of being, therefore it is rightly called a "pad." (See Commentary pp. 288-291).

This stable experience of the true nature of the self, which is the "pad" perceived by the "pad-vedya," is attained through the breaking of the "granthi" (knots of ignorance) by this steady vision. Therefore, there is the attainment of subtle knowledge. And from such a person with subtle knowledge and correct vision, such spontaneous utterances emerge: "By the power of this pure and correct vision, I have avoided the animalistic state and attained the divine state, revealing the divine and inherent nature of the self. I will never forget the immeasurable grace of the Lord Veer, who has made this possible. I remember him day and night.

"I will not forget the virtues of the Veer, I remember him day and night; he who has avoided the animalistic state and attained the divine state, I am eternally grateful to him." - Shri. D. Sakzay. P-2.

"The knowledge that was being accumulated for an infinite period of time, was transformed in a single moment, which led to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death. I bow to this auspicious and pure vision." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

"Like the play of a child in a dust-house, all actions in the cycle of birth and death appear to the wise. Through the breaking of the knot of ignorance, all actions in the cycle of birth and death appear like the play of a child in a dust-house to the wise." - 155

**Commentary:** "Like the play of a child in a dust-house, all actions in the cycle of birth and death appear here. The attainment of the "trathi" (threefold knowledge) enters into the "savi" (self), and the eight great attainments are attained." - Shri. J. D. Sakzay. P-3

**Vritti (Commentary):** "Like the play of a child in a dust-house - due to the ugliness and instability of nature, all actions in the cycle of birth and death appear like the play of a child in a dust-house to the wise - due to the breaking of the knot of ignorance, all actions in the cycle of birth and death appear like the play of a child in a dust-house to the wise."

(462)
**Chaugadashtisasuy**

In this vision, the fourfold fetters are differentiated, so it appears to them like the dust-house play of a child in the entire world, because by nature, both are equal in ugliness and instability. The child plays the game of making a house of dust. Those houses are naturally ugly and unstable, falling apart with a touch or a blow. Similarly, all worldly efforts, this worldly effort, are also naturally ugly, uncomfortable, and unstable, fleeting like a moment. Thus, both are equal. Indeed, even the wealth of a Chakravarti, considered the most excellent in the world, is ugly and temporary when viewed from the perspective of truth, like mixed food. Those who, with immense power, became rulers of six continents and, meeting in the universe, gave rise to "heavy kings," were not clever Chakravartis, but came empty-handed and left empty-handed. So many Chakravartis have come and gone in this world that when a new Chakravarti arises, they have to erase a name from the Rishabhkut mountain with a Kikini gem to make space for their own name! Thus, countless rulers have come and gone on this earth, and this earth has not gone with anyone nor will it go. This is the state of even the highest position in this world, so what to speak of other lower levels? (See pp. 24-250).

**Baladhuli Ghar**
**Kriya Sami**

Just as a child's house is completely temporary and disappears in a moment, so too does this worldly play end in a moment, it was never there to begin with. Everywhere in this world, there is only fleetingness and discomfort. It is like the child's house, which pleases the child, but just as a grown-up would not like or would be ashamed to play such a game, similarly, this worldly effort, this dust-house play, does not please the wise, the knowledgeable, the right-visioned person, and to play in it, to enjoy it, would be a cause of shame! It would seem shameful. And this entire worldly effort appears to them like a child's dust-house play because they have differentiated the fourfold fetters. Through this differentiation of the fourfold fetters, they have attained right vision, the vision of the path, and therefore they experience the truly sorrowful nature of the world. Thus, the nature of the differentiation of the fetters and the right vision attained as its fruit is briefly understood in this context:

**Granthibhed**

The right-visioned person, who has attained this fifth stable vision, has differentiated the fourfold fetters, which are...

**Sthiraiti:**  **Gathibhed Dashamehupsham-Samyagdarshan**

(463) The ignorance-like darkness-form **granthi** has been broken, the ignorance-filled **moha**-darkness has been torn apart. This ignorance is truly **tamas**-like darkness, because just as an object cannot be seen in darkness, so too an object cannot be seen in the darkness of ignorance. This ignorance, which is like darkness, quickly disappears when the light of knowledge arises - it flees completely. Just as long-lasting darkness disappears immediately when a lamp is lit, so too the **moha**-darkness, which is without beginning, is immediately destroyed when the lamp of knowledge is lit. Therefore, all things are seen in their true form, as they are. Thus, this **yogi** has **samyagdarshan**, **samyagdristi** knowledge.

“**Kamabhav** is ignorance, **moksha**-feeling is one's own abode;
Ignorance is like darkness, knowledge-light destroys it. **Rag** and **dvesha** are ignorance, the main **karma**-knot,
Liberation happens from it, that is the path to **moksha**.” - Shri Atmasiddhi

This **tamograntshi** is the result of **rag** and **dvesha**, which are dense and thick, born from the **karma** of life; and it is extremely difficult, like a rough, dense, fixed, and hidden knot in bamboo. That is why it is called **granthi** - knot. This hard, complex, mountain-like, powerful **tamograntshi** is broken here by the extraordinary **atmapurushaarth** with extraordinary, sharp **bhaava**-power. Therefore, **samyaktva** is attained, and **samyagdarshan** is attained through **anivrittikaran**, which cannot be avoided - it cannot be stopped, so that the true form of things is seen. (For more details, see pp. 39 and 46-47).

**Samyagdarshan** is different from the **haadi**, it is the **atma**, it is always useful, it is imperishable...
Listen to the original path of the **Jina**! Know it through the teachings of the **sadguru**, the knowledge is called **khaas**...
The knowledge that is known, it is pure **pratiti**...
The **bhagavat** said that **darshan** is that, its other name is **samyag**...

- Shrimad Rajchandraji. Thus, **samyagdarshan** arises as a result of the **granthibhed**. This **samyaktva** or **samyagdarshan** is a quality of the **atma**, and it is **nirvikalpa**. This subtle quality is **kevalgyan**-accessible and is the subject of **paramaavashi** and **man:paryaya** knowledge, not the subject of **matijnan**, **tajnan**, or **deshaavdhi**. Therefore, whether this quality has manifested or not... 

Page #540:
---------------------------
(464)
The collection of the eight types of knowledge (Gadashti Samuchaya) is known only by the true knower. This quality, from the beginning of time, has become a false taste due to the rise of the delusion of perception (Darshanamoha) - like milk poured into a bitter gourd, by the grace of God, the attainment of time, etc. (Kalaadi Labdhi) is achieved, and when it is near the end of the ocean of existence (Bhavasamudra), due to the result of the feeling of grandeur (Bhavya Bhavana) - due to the suitability of the living being (Jiva) - the living being attains right conduct (Samyaktv). These five attainments are the cause of this attainment of right conduct:
(1) Kshapashamik Labdhi - the attainment of the destruction of the karmas (Kshapashmani). (2) Vishuddhi Labdhi - the purity of the soul that arises from the destruction of the karmas. (3) Deshana Labdhi - the teachings of the true guru, etc. (4) Prayogiki Labdhi - the state of the five attainments (Kame) decreases and becomes only a fraction of an atom (Antar Kata Koti Maatra). (5) Karan Darshanamoha Labdhi - the special power of the soul (Atmasamarthya Vishesh) that gives the power to destroy the state of the karmas and the taste of the karmas. Karan Labdhi is of three types:
Adha Karan, Apurva Karan, Anivritti Karan. The nature of this Karan has been explained before. After this Karan Labdhi, at the final moment (Antamuhurt), the destruction of the delusion of perception (Darshanamoha) inevitably leads to right perception (Samyagdarshan), i.e., the false state of perception becomes the right state. But
as long as the rise of the infinite binding passions (Anantanu bandhi Kashaya) exists, this right perception does not benefit. Because these evil infinite binding passions (Kashaya) in the form of intense anger, pride, deceit, and greed are the ones that destroy and obstruct right conduct (Samyaktv), they bring the delusion of perception (Darshanamoha), the root cause of infinite existence (Anant Sansar), into existence, therefore, it is given the true name "Anantanu bandhi". Thus, this great, terrible, infinite binding passion (Anantanu bandhi Kashaya), which binds to infinite existence (Anant Sansar), is eliminated only when the delusion of perception (Darshanamoha) is eliminated, therefore, one should understand the practical nature of the infinite binding passion (Anantanu bandhi) and make every effort to avoid it from the soul.
The living being who is attached to the world (Sansar) for the sake of the world, and who worships false gurus, gods, and religions for the sake of the higher purpose (Parmarth), due to delusion, suffers a lot from the infinite binding passions (Anantanu bandhi) of anger, pride, deceit, and greed, because other worldly actions do not bind to infinite existence (Anant Anubandh) very much. Only the living being who knows the higher purpose (Parmarth) and is eager to worship the true knower (Parmarth Gyanee), the god, and the religion, is truly free from them. It is very true to say that he is free from them. It is possible that he may be influenced by the false guru, etc., due to his attachment to the false guru, god, and religion, due to his bad company, due to his carelessness, and due to his neglect. Also, his worldly desires (Sansar Vasna) will not be cut off by his bad company.
* "खयुवसम विसोही देसणा पाउग्ग करणलद्धिए । चत्तारिवि सामण्णा करणं पुण होदि सम्मत्ते॥"
Shri Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravattakrit Shri Gammasar,

**Sthiradrishti:** The commencement of Samyaktvamas, the Dasanamaha Upshama.

(465) Even though they exist, they remain indifferent to the ultimate goal, believing in fragmentation. This is the very form of infinite anger, pride, deceit, and greed.” – Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 375, 523. (459, 613)

Furthermore, from the nature of these five attainments, it becomes clear that the key (Master-key) to attaining Samyaktvamas lies in the middle path, the path of Deshana Ladhi. Because only through the destruction of desires can the soul attain purity, and only then can it become eligible to receive the teachings of the true Guru. Subsequently, it attains Samyaktvamas in a sequential manner. Therefore, the soul must first attain purity. And how is this achieved? Through sincere effort and the attainment of virtues like Prashamadi.

When the passions are pacified, there is no desire other than liberation. When there is regret for the world and compassion in the end, then this soul attains purity, and it is truly called a “Jignasu” (seeker). The true Guru who binds with such a pure and eligible Jignasu soul, that soul attains Samkiti (spiritual awakening) and progresses in the search within. Then, through the practice of Samyak Praiti (correct understanding) of the Guru's teachings, it attains Samkiti, and as a result, it experiences the ultimate goal, the pure self-realization, which is Paramartha Samkiti. Thus, it gradually progresses through the stages of Samyaktvamas, which are interconnected and progressively increasing.

The pacification of passions, only one desire;
Regret for the world, compassion within, that is called a Jignasu. That Jignasu soul, binds with the true Guru.
It attains Samkiti, progresses in the search within. Abandoning the attachment to views and opinions, it focuses on the true Guru.
It attains pure Samkiti, where there is no division or faction. It experiences its own nature, realizing the ultimate goal.
Its tendencies flow in its own essence, attaining Paramartha Samkiti.
As Samkiti increases, it avoids false appearances;
The virtue of Charitra (conduct) arises, and the state of Vitaraga (freedom from attachment) resides.”

Shri Atmasiddhi

In Atmasiddhi, three types of Samkiti are taught: (1) The first Samkiti is said to be the understanding of the words of the true person, the eagerness for the teachings, and the devotion to the true person with complete surrender. (2) The second type of Samkiti is the clear experience of the ultimate goal. (3) The third type of Samkiti is the experience of the ultimate goal without any doubt. The first Samkiti is the cause of the second Samkiti. The second Samkiti is the cause of the third Samkiti. All three Samkitis are accepted by the Vitaraga (liberated) person. All three Samkitis are to be cultivated, respected, and devoted to.” – Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 689 (751)

(46)
From all this, it is evident that by abandoning self-destruction and taking refuge at the feet of the Shri Sadguru, the soul of the seeker is freed from the infinite bondage of the evil karmas (kṣayās) and the poison of attachment (dāna-meha) is pacified. Just as the rays of the sun destroy darkness and the directions become radiant and pure, so too, purity arises in all the regions of the soul, leading to mental joy and clarity, which destroys the three types of bondage. Or, just as someone who has drunk wine or datura becomes unconscious, but after a while, the intoxication subsides and they become conscious and healthy, so too, the soul becomes unconscious due to the rise of the attachment to perception (darśana-meha), there is confusion, the mind is unsteady, there is unconsciousness and delusion. But when this attachment to perception is pacified and the unconsciousness is destroyed, the soul becomes healthy.
“When the attachment to perception is transcended and knowledge arises,
The knowledge of the pure consciousness, distinct from the body… (previous occasion)”—Shrimad Rajchandraji. What is the characteristic of right perception (samyag-darśana)? Faith (śraddhā) and other qualities are the external characteristics of right perception. These faith and other qualities are not the essence of right perception, but are synonyms of knowledge. Moreover, self-realization (ātma-anubhūti) is also knowledge, because it is a synonym of knowledge. Therefore, faith and other qualities are not the characteristics of right perception. In other words, knowledge is not right perception, and what is said to be the external characteristic can be called the external characteristic. Because, just as health is difficult to perceive, but can be known through the gross characteristic of enthusiasm in mind, speech, and body, so too, right perception is difficult to perceive, but can be known through the external characteristics of selfless faith, self-realization, etc. Since it is not possible to describe a non-conceptual (nirvikalpa) object, it is described through knowledge, because knowledge is the only quality that is conceptual and concrete, like a lamp, which is the object of itself and others, reveals itself and others, and determines and makes certain itself and others. All other qualities are non-conceptual and do not reveal themselves or others. Therefore, right perception is also a subtle quality that is non-conceptual, formless, and beyond the reach of words. Therefore, it cannot be described or heard through any means. Therefore, in the practice of the soul, knowledge is the only thing that is evident, and it is self-evident.
x “There, the mention is like the destruction of darkness by the rays of the sun. The directions become radiant, all become pure. The mention of right perception is the same as the pacification of ego-attachment. Purity in all regions, which destroys the three types of bondage.”
(For reference, see) Shri Amritchandracharya (3) composed Shri Panchaadhyayee. * “Faith and other qualities are the external characteristics of right perception.
Therefore, they are synonyms of knowledge.”–Shri Panchaadhyayee.

**Stable Existence: The Scope of Self-Realization, Faith, and Conduct**
(467)

Self-realization is the ultimate goal, the ultimate refuge. Knowledge is the means to achieve other virtues.

"The formless, the one who collects, the one who differentiates, is the embodied one;
The knowledge of the two, the consciousness, the action of grasping the object..." - Vasupujya

The self-realization, the experience of the self, is the knowledge of the self. This self-realization has an inseparable relationship with right faith, an inseparable relationship that cannot exist without the other. In other words, if there is right faith, there is self-realization; if there is self-realization, there is right faith; if there is no right faith, there is no self-realization; if there is no self-realization, there is no right faith.

Therefore, due to the mutual pervasiveness of both, it can be said that right faith is self-realization, that self-realization which is pure and self-existent. In other words, it should be understood that where the experience of the pure self exists, there is right faith. Thus, pure self-realization is the inseparable primary characteristic of right faith.

Furthermore, let us examine how virtues like right faith, etc., are characteristics of right vision: "The faith in the true meaning is indicative" - The Tattvartha Sutra states that faith in the true meaning is a characteristic of right vision. This faith in the true meaning, the object of faith, is of four types: (1) Faith - the inclination towards the true meaning. (2) Faith - the affinity, the feeling of oneness, the feeling of self. (3) Perception and acceptance of the true meaning, love. (4) Conduct - action in accordance with it. This is a progressive sequence. The first three are in the form of knowledge, they are synonymous with knowledge; and conduct is the action of the mind, speech, and body in virtuous deeds. Whether these four are collectively or individually present, they may or may not be characteristics of right vision, they may be present with right faith or with wrong faith, or this faith may or may not be present with right vision. Therefore, this faith, etc., is not itself a characteristic of right vision, but if it is accompanied by self-realization, then it is a virtue, a characteristic of right vision; without self-realization, it is a semblance of virtue, i.e., it is not a virtue. Thus, if all of these, including faith, etc., are accompanied by self-realization, then it is right faith, but if it is accompanied by a semblance of faith, etc., like wrong faith, etc., then it is not right faith. In other words, if there is faith, etc., but not pure self-realization, then there is no right faith; if there is faith, etc., and pure self-realization, then there is right faith.

There are two types of this faith, etc. - right and wrong. (1) If it is accompanied by self-realization, then it is right faith, etc., and it is the only true faith worthy of being called faith. (2) If it is accompanied by self-realization...

(468)
The collection of yogic views that are devoid of reality is called mithya shraddha, etc. In other words, it is not shraddha, etc. The reason for differentiating between shraddha, atma, etc. is that the scope of shraddha and self-experience is the same. Because shraddha in an unperceived meaning, i.e., shraddha in a meaning that has not been experienced, is like a mirage, like the horns of a donkey. In other words, it is not possible to have firm shraddha in an object that has not been experienced. Moreover, shraddha that is based solely on scriptures, without self-experience, is also not shraddha in the true sense, even though it follows the truth. Because there is no perception, there is no self-experience. The implication is that where there is true, firm shraddha, there is self-experience, and where there is self-experience, there is true, firm shraddha. Thus, there is a scope of both, an inseparable relationship. That is why the term "shraddha" has become a conventional term for the characteristic of samyaktv. Even in that, only shraddha that includes self-experience is true shraddha. This is the meaning to understand. And this is the secret of the great saying, "Taryashraddhanam vachanam - shraddha in the truth is samyagdarshan." Because self-experience is the essence of shraddha. Shraddha without self-experience is not true shraddha.

Thus, without pure self-experience, there is no samyagdarshan, and without self-experience, there is no true shraddha. Therefore, (1) self-experience is the main characteristic of samyagdarshan, or (2) samyak shraddha arising from self-experience is the characteristic of samyagdarshan. This is evident. Here, self-experience means pure self-experience arising from pure knowledge, free from delusion. That is why Shri Samyasarji has clearly stated, "The knowledge and experience of the living being, non-living being, merit, demerit, inflow, restraint, cessation, bondage, and liberation, as they are, is samyaktv."

"The living being, non-living being, merit, demerit, inflow, and bondage; restraint, cessation, liberation, and truth are called the nine substances.
The living being and non-living being do not include those substances; they are special considerations of things, different explanations given by the great sages." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. "Because the world binds with bondage, because it causes liberation, inflow and restraint are the names, respectively, that are heard at the feet of the Lord... Padma Prabhu." - Shri Anandghanji. In this, (1) the living being is the object to be attained, to be grasped, (2-3-4) the inflow...

**Knowledge of Differentiation through Steadfast Vision and Nine Tattvas**

(469) And the karmic actions of merit and demerit, which are parts of it, are to be abandoned, they are worthy of renunciation. (P-6) The non-living being, which is worthy of renunciation, is the cause of the inflow of passions, and it is the cause of bondage, which is the grasping and acceptance of the nine tattvas, through the knowledge of differentiation, therefore, both are worthy of renunciation. (7-8-9) Restraint and knowledge of differentiation, which are the means of purification, are the cause of the destruction and weakening of the non-living being, which is worthy of renunciation, and the ultimate destruction and weakening of the non-living being, which is worthy of renunciation, is liberation for the soul, therefore, these three tattvas are to be adopted. This adoption of knowledge of differentiation makes a person with right vision. (See - Shri Amritchandracharya's Tattvarthasar). Thus, from the true meaning, from the ultimate meaning, from the body and all other things, the inherent light shines forth, which, "like the golden thread in a garland of many colors, does not abandon its oneness, even though it is made up of nine tattvas!" To experience the knowledge of differentiation of this pure soul, which is the distinct light, to experience it, to manifest the knowledge of the self, is right vision, rightness, or samyaktva. (See p. 40)
"The glory of righteousness does not rise, nor does it set, its measure is not known anywhere, nor does it go into the cycle of deposits. What else can be said about this all-pervading abode, when the experience is attained, duality does not appear."
- Shri Amritchandracharya's Shri Samayasar Kalash Nay Nikshepe Re Jeh Na Jaaniye, Navi Jihan Prasare Praman Shudd Swaroope Te Brahma Dakhave, Keval Anubhav Bhan...Veer Jineshwar Parmeshwar Jaye. Alak Agochar Anupam Arthane, Kenun Kahi Jaane Re Bhed? Sahaja Vishuddha Re Anubhav Vayan Je, Shastra Te Sagalo Re Khed Veer. - Shri Anandghanji
There are also other external signs of right vision, which are the manifestation of this experience of the soul; and they are five: tranquility, enthusiasm, detachment, compassion, and faith. (See - p. 41-42). These qualities of tranquility, etc., are also signs of right vision from an external perspective; if they are present along with the experience of the soul, tranquility, etc., or rightness, then they are qualities, otherwise they are external signs, the appearance of qualities. In other words, tranquility, etc., are not signs of right vision if there is no experience of the soul. Its concise form is as follows: (1) Tranquility is the mind's relaxation in the passions, that is, the calming of the passions. Or, it is the absence of the desire to punish those who have committed offenses, it is the calming of anger and the practice of forgiveness.
(2) Enthusiasm - (a) Extreme enthusiasm in the dharma of the soul and in the fruits of dharma, (b) affection for the righteous, (c) love for the supreme beings, is enthusiasm. For example - (a) The soul itself is the only dharma, or the experience of the pure soul is the only dharma, and its fruit

There is a single path (Akshapada) which is characterized by Gadarisrushna (intense desire), Atiinndriya (beyond the senses), Akshaya (imperishable), and Kshayika (perishable).  One who has such intense desire for Atmadharma (true nature of the soul) and Moksha (liberation) which is the fruit of Atmadharma, is said to have Sanveg (intense desire). (2) Sanveg is also having intense love for those who practice and worship Atmadharma. However, having affection for those who are merely nominal practitioners without true qualities is not Sanveg but Moha (attachment). Because here, Anurga (affection) does not mean desire, but love for qualities, or it means detachment from Adharma (unrighteousness) or Adharmakala (unrighteous time). (2) Or, having intense love and devotion for the Supreme Being (Parameshti Bhagwan) who has attained Atmadharma and its fruits, or who has achieved the highest state of its practice, is Sanveg. In other words, Sanveg is to worship and adore Arihant, Siddha, Acharya, Upadhyaya, and Sadhu with intense desire and joy. Thus, Sanveg is the absence of any desire other than the practice of Atmadharma and Moksha, which is the fruit of Atmadharma. Only this single desire is Sanveg in the form of Vidhi (prescriptive), and the abandonment of all desires is Sanveg in the form of Nishedha (prohibitive) or Niveda (renunciation). This is the division made by the great sage Shri Panchadhyayikaar. This Sanveg is the same as Dharma, because anything that is motivated by desire or wish other than Moksha is not Dharma. And mere action is not Dharma, even Mithyadristi (false perception) performs actions, but its actions are always contrary to the righteous feelings of raga (attachment) etc., and are therefore unrighteous. Because Mithyadristi is always attached, Samyakdristi (right perception) is always detached, and always has Sanveg. (See page 277).
"Sanveg: Paramosaho dhau dharmafale chitaha | Sadharmeshu anurago va pritirva paramesthishu || Dharma samyaktramatma shuddhasyanubhavo'thava |
Tar# Suramachchakshamaarchcha kshaavi 2 cha7 ." – Shri Panchadhyayi. (3) Nirveda (renunciation) means abandoning all desires and wishes related to the world, detachment, being tired and bored of the world, feeling regret for the world. (4) Anukampa (compassion) means having a feeling of grace and kindness towards all beings, or friendship, or motherly love, or the absence of hatred. Compassion is the equality that exists towards all beings, and in terms of meaning, it is self-compassion - like the removal of a thorn. This self-compassion is the main one.
* "Saala: Sarvamia cha niro hakaraatha | Sa sanvego'thava dharmaha saabhilaasho na dharmavan ||"
(For reference, see) - Panchadhyayi.

**Stable Vision, Tranquility, etc. are the Characteristics of Right Faith**

(47)  Knowing that attachment, etc., impure thoughts are bound by good conduct, but not by bad conduct, and that abandoning attachment, etc., and binding the soul is compassion – the mercy of the father's soul. (5)  Aitiky – the inherent nature of the principle, in its existence, in Dharma, in the purpose of Dharma, and in the fruit of Dharma – the soul, etc., is the Dharma that is determined as it is. This Aitiky, which is accompanied by self-realization, is Right Faith, otherwise it is false Aitiky.

“The soul is eternal, it is the doer, its own karma,
It is the enjoyer, it is mixed, the mixture is the remedy.” – Shri Atmasiddhi

The calming of the mind, the weakening of the passions that have arisen, the state of the soul that can be withdrawn, or the calming of the tendencies of the beginningless time is called **Shram**.  The desire for nothing other than liberation, no aspiration, is called **Sanveg**.  Since it is understood that one has been wandering in delusion, now it is enough! Oh soul! Now be patient, that is **Nirved**.  Immersion in the words of the selfless men whose ultimate goal is great fortune is called **Shraddha-Astha**.  Through all these, the soul develops a self-like intellect, that is **Anukampa**.  These characteristics are worthy of contemplation, worthy of remembrance, worthy of desire, worthy of experience.”

- Shrimad Rajchandra Patrak 122. (135)  These qualities of tranquility, etc., are the external characteristics of Right Vision if they are accompanied by self-realization, otherwise they are not the characteristics of Right Vision.  Thus, pure self-realization is always paramount, pure self-realization, tranquility, etc., are the main things in the world.  However, these qualities of tranquility, etc., are the cause of the necessary attainment of Right Vision, because as the qualities of tranquility, etc., increase in the soul, so does its ability to attain Right Vision.  When the passions of the objects are calmed, there is no other desire except liberation, there is intense detachment from the world, and there is compassion for all beings and for the father's soul, then such a purified soul becomes eligible for the teachings of the true Guru, and those teachings become the cause of contemplation, and thus the six states of existence from the existence of the soul to the state of liberation are understood – Aitiky arises, and self-realization – self-knowledge manifests, Right Vision is attained, and thus the passions are destroyed and the state of liberation is attained.  This complete and perfect order of attaining the path has been clearly explained by the great master of the principles, Shrimad Rajchandraji, in Shri Atmasiddhi, in this extremely beautiful and meaningful saying.

Yoga-drishti samuchaya is the calmness of kshaya, only moksha abhilasha; in bhava, kheda, pranidaya, there, atmaarth nivaas. Dasha is not like that, until then, jeev will not get jag; mokshamarg will not be attained, antar reg will not be removed.
Where such dasha comes, sadguru bodh suhay; there, all suvicharana, there, sukhday will be revealed.
Where suvicharana is revealed, there, nijgyaan is revealed,
In that jnaan, moha is destroyed, pad nirvana is attained.” - Shri Atmasiddhiji. Thus, prashma-tyaga-vairagya-adi atmajnaan is successful, and it is also the best purpose of attaining atmajnaan. Because, tyaga-vairagya is not in the chitta-antarang of one, asthi-maja-paryat is not spread throughout the body, atmajnaan will not happen to him; and in tyaga-viragya, the jeev who gets stuck - does not move forward towards the desired goal of atmajnaan, he forgets the awareness of his father, that is, the original purpose of attaining atmajnaan, or tyaga-vairagya-adi, which is very essential, he misses that original purpose.
Vairagya-adi is successful, which is along with atmajnaan, as well as the diagnosis of attaining atmajnaan. Tyaga-viraga is not in the chitta, jnaan does not happen to him
Tyaga-viraga gets stuck, he forgets his own awareness.” - Shri Atmasiddhi. Where this supreme benevolent pramada-adi guna is revealed, where samyak shraddha of paramarth-tatvarth is elevated, and where revealed atmajnaan - shuddha atmaanubhav happens, such supreme blessed, supreme venerable, supreme rare kalyaanmurti samyagdarshan is attained by the yogi who is situated in this fifth stable drishti, from the separation of tamogranthi. And thus, the one whose darshan-meh is destroyed, and who has attained the light of clear atmajnaan, such mahabuddhiman viveki samyagdristi dristi yogi, experiences the terrible, painful, unstable form of this sansaar, it is directly experienced, that is why, this supreme blessed samyagdristi purush, all sansaar cheshta appears like a child's play, there is no wonder in it. Because - the one who attains darshan of himself, his mind does not go to another bhaam, there is a little chance of becoming Krishna, he does not like the company of sansaar. Laughing, playing, Hari is revealed, my life is successful, I write it to you; muktanand's naath vihaari, oodha jeevandevi amari.” - Shri Muktanandji.

##  Rithradashti: "Mirage water is a delusion. Blessed is he who lives..."

(473) Thus, the saints have sung the great glory of self-knowledge - Samyagdarshan. Shrimaan Yashvijayji says that the fruit of self-knowledge is meditation, and self-knowledge is the liberator, therefore, the great soul should always strive for this self-knowledge, because knowing the soul, there is nothing left to know, and not knowing the soul, then other knowledge is useless." The supreme self-knower, Shrimad Rajchandraji, also says -

"When you know your own form, then you know everything; if you don't know your own form, then knowing everything is useless." - Shrimad Rajchandra

"Maya, mirage, Gandharvanagar, dream-like. He sees the external objects truly, through the wisdom of scriptures." (156)

Mirage water, Gandharvanagar, and dreams are all similar;
He sees the external objects truly, with the wisdom of scriptures. (156)

Meaning: - This type of person, with this vision, sees external objects truly, through the wisdom of scriptures, as Maya water, Gandharvanagar, and dreams.

Commentary: "He who has time as his servant, mirage water as his delusion... blessed is he who lives! He who has hope as his slave, lust and anger as his prisoners... blessed is he who lives!"

This type of yogi has attained the wisdom of scriptures, therefore, he sees the external objects like body, house, etc., as mirage water, Gandharvanagar, and dreams, from the perspective of ultimate truth.

This Samyagdarshi believes that this entire world is like a mirage, like mirage water - illusory like the water in a mirage (see page 216). In the middle of summer, the forest,
the mirage, Gandharvanagar, Harishchandrapur, etc., dreams - rooms, appear to be real, the cinema - its shapes, the external - body, house, etc., the husband - he sees, from the perspective of the soul, from the perspective of ultimate truth, the illusory - objects, why? Because - the wisdom of scriptures - through the wisdom of scriptures, by having the right knowledge of scriptures.

"Knowing this soul, there is nothing left to know. Not knowing this, other knowledge is useless."

Shri Adhyatmasar, Atmanishchayadhyayakar

A thirsty deer, misled by mirage, sees water in the distance and runs towards it with all its might! But since that mirage is not real water, just an illusion, it keeps receding as the deer approaches! The poor deer keeps running in vain, chasing its false hope! Similarly, a traveler crossing a desert at noon sees a mirage of water in the distance. Thirsty, he runs towards it, but the water remains just as far away! Because that water is false, a mere illusion, a visual deception created by the sun's rays. So, he is left disappointed! In the same way, these feelings of attachment to the body, house, etc., are like mirages. They are not ours, yet they appear to be ours due to our lack of understanding, our illusion, our false perception! So, a foolish being, like a deer, considers them his own and runs after them, driven by a desperate desire to possess them! But how can something that is not truly ours ever be obtained? As this being runs after them, they keep receding, mocking him! It's as if they are cruelly making fun of him, playing a trick on him! 

Because in this endless cycle of existence, this being has taken on countless bodies. Which body does this being consider its own? The body that this being mistakenly considers its own, it abandons, like a thief, leaving it behind! And this being, like a sheep, keeps rubbing its hands in vain! If this body, which is constantly changing, is not truly ours, then how can we be attached to possessions like houses, etc., which are dependent on that body? If this soul, like milk and water, resides in this body for a short time, and even this body is not truly ours, then how can other things, which are completely different from it, be ours? Therefore, these external feelings, like the body, are illusory, like mirages, as a person with right understanding clearly sees.

Great souls, who wander in the form of bodies, always focus on the eternal, immortal, infinite soul that resides within the body. Even though this soul may have taken on many bodies, which body does it consider its own?

Sri Mansukh Bhai Kirchand's "Srimad Rajchandra's Life Story." Or, these feelings of attachment to the body, house, etc., are like castles in the air, created in the sky. 

Page #551:

"This is a dream, this world" - Shravak.

(475) Like cities! Illusionists create a city in the sky, but that illusory city disappears in an instant! The sky city vanishes into thin air! Or, it is impossible to create a city in the sky, a world without support! Building castles in the air is impossible, like the illusory imaginations of a charlatan! Similarly, these external objects like the body, house, etc., are momentary and illusory, they exist and cease to exist in an instant. These bodies, etc., are truly external to the soul, they are external influences, the soul has nothing to do with them in the ultimate sense. In the words of Shri Devchandraji, "Matter does not mix with matter, the feeling is different and unattainable." The inert is inert and the conscious is conscious, this is the unchanging state in all three times. Therefore, any imagination of a relationship with the body, etc., is like the illusory imagination of creating a city in the sky. As Shri Pujyapad Swami ji has said, "From the delusion of the self in the body, the imaginations of son, wife, etc., have arisen, and by this, the world, believing in the wealth of the soul, has been destroyed!" "The electric Lakshmi, the lordly kite, the life is like the waves of water; the Purandari bow, the eternal color, what is the use of ruling there for a moment?" - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

Or, these external objects like the body, house, etc., are like dreams. Just as the things seen in a dream do not appear in the waking state, they appear illusory, similarly, these body, etc., imaginations seen in the state of ignorance, the dream state, do not appear real in the state of knowledge, the state of self-awareness, they appear illusory. Or, whatever it is, the world is like a beautiful dream. If a beautiful dream comes and all kinds of excellent things are gathered in it, still, it does not take long for it to dissolve in an instant; and alas! Those things are gone and our things are gone! - This illusory regret remains in the mind! Similarly, if this body, house, etc., has a beautiful combination and the power of a chakravarti, etc., is attained and there is an abundance of excellent enjoyments, even then, all of it disappears in an instant like a dream, and alas! These things are gone, this worry remains in the mind! "The beggar's regret" is an apt illustration that Shrimad Rajchandraji has described in Moksha Mala, it applies here perfectly. A beggar has a dream of excellent royal splendor, and then he experiences excitement in that dream, and then alas! A storm comes - thunder and lightning roar, and his dream remains incomplete, only regret remains for him! Thus, this world is truly like a dream, therefore, the simple, piercing words of the whip-wielding Bhaja Bhagata have sung the truth with a mixed heart, that animals! Take refuge in the Kirtar, this is...

"The aggregate of the six senses is a dream, the world is a dream," - and so on.  This is how the world appears to the Jñānī, the man of perfect knowledge, who constantly contemplates the right view (Samyakdṛṣṭi).  To him, this entire world appears like a dream, like a mirage, like a city in the sky, like a reflection, like dust and ashes, like a speck of soot.  This is because the state of ignorance, which is like a dream, has passed away, and he has attained the state of awakening, which is like knowledge.  "When I wake up, I don't see the world, in sleep, it appears strange and unreal; the play of consciousness is like that, it hangs on to the Brahman." - Shri Narasimha Mehta.
The whole world is like a reflection, or like a dream;
That is what the Jñānī knows, the rest is just talk. - Shri Ātmasiddhi.
This world is tormented by the three fires (tapas).  It runs after the water of the mirage, wanting to quench its thirst, it is miserable.  Due to ignorance, it has forgotten its true nature, and has been caught in a terrible cycle of birth and death.  It experiences immense sorrow, diseases like fever, fear of death, and the pain of separation, it is helpless.  Only a perfect man (Sapuruṣa) can be its refuge.  Without the words of a perfect man, no one can overcome these fires and thirst, this is certain.  Therefore, again and again, we meditate on the feet of that man. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter 184.
Thus, this world evokes a very intense inner detachment in the yogi who has the right view (Samyakdṛṣṭi).  Such a Jñānī is imbued with this deep feeling, because he has developed Śrutaviveka, the right understanding of the scriptures.  He has attained the true knowledge of the scriptures (see Śrutaviveka, pp. 19-20).  In other words, the man who has the right view (Samyakdṛṣṭi) develops Śrutaviveka from the scriptures he has heard from the perfect man, the true guru.  He has attained the true knowledge of the scriptures, he has realized the true nature of things, he has understood the difference between the self and the non-self, he has experienced the clear distinction between the soul and the non-soul, he has developed the knowledge of the pure soul, he has attained the knowledge of the pure soul.
For example, "I am the pure, conscious, imperishable, eternal soul, distinct from this body and other things.  This perishable body and other things are not me.  Only the pure self is mine, nothing else is mine.  I am not this body and other things, and this body and other things are not mine." - this is the firm conviction of his soul.
"His own nature shines forth, pure consciousness, imperishable, eternal, and beyond the body." - Ātmasiddhi. 

Page #553:
---------------------------
**Steadfast Vision:** 'Why should one taste the effects of others?' Doubtless, right vision.
(477) Always take refuge in the path of the Nigantha, as the revered Guru has said. I am not the body or any form, and the body, woman, son, etc., are not great. I am the soul, pure consciousness, imperishable. By having this self-awareness, attachment and aversion are destroyed.”
–Shrimad Rajchandraji.

Therefore, this garland is a pure self-awareness, worthy of acceptance. All other feelings are transient, worthy of abandonment. Therefore, I will only worship my self-awareness and abandon all other worldly attachments. This is the right path. Our self-awareness, which is the foundation of consciousness, is the true family, better than all other relationships. “That true family is the best.” Therefore, O conscious one! Be calm and free from all worldly attachments! Be free! O treasure of joy! This is the ultimate remedy for attaining ultimate peace. Take refuge in it! Take refuge in it!
“Our self-awareness, which is pure consciousness, is better than all other relationships. That true family is the best…peace-giving.” –Shri Anandghanji.

Thus, a wise person with right vision, decides to take refuge in his own nature and abandon worldly attachments. The example of the garment brought from the washerman's house, which has been changed, is appropriate here. Just as a man, due to delusion, takes a garment from the washerman's house and, believing it to be his own, lies down wearing it. Since he is ignorant, he is approached by another who, seeing him, grabs him and forcibly tries to strip him naked, saying, “Hey! Get up quickly! Give me this garment that has been changed!” Hearing this repeatedly, he examines it carefully with all his senses and realizes that it is indeed someone else's. Then, becoming wise, he immediately discards the garment. Similarly, the knower, due to delusion, accepts worldly attachments as his own and, believing them to be his own, lies down in them, engrossed in worldly pursuits. Since he is ignorant, the Guru, seeing him, tries to awaken him and instructs him, saying, “Awaken! Realize that the soul is one.” Hearing this repeatedly, he examines it carefully with all his senses and realizes that it is indeed worldly attachments. Then, becoming wise, he immediately abandons all worldly attachments. Because,
x “When a man knows that he is attached to worldly things, then he abandons all worldly attachments and becomes wise.” (For reference, see Shri Samyatsar and Shri Amritchandracharya's commentary).

"A soul is not a collection of five senses, nor is it a collection of karmic particles. It is not a collection of colors, nor is it a collection of material objects. It is not a collection of thoughts, nor is it a collection of emotions. It is not a collection of actions, nor is it a collection of experiences. It is not a collection of anything. It is simply pure consciousness.

Oh, Shri Sumati, your purity is so profound that you do not collect anything, nor do you give anything away. You do not hold onto anything, nor do you reject anything. You are simply pure consciousness. You are simply pure awareness. You are simply pure being.

Oh, Shri Sumati, your purity shines so brightly that it inspires others to seek the truth. It inspires others to become free from the suffering of the world. It inspires others to become pure consciousness.

Oh, Shri Sumati, your purity is a beacon of hope for all beings. It is a reminder that we are all pure consciousness. It is a reminder that we are all capable of achieving liberation.

Shri Devarandraji, when one becomes fully enlightened, one realizes the true nature of the self. One realizes that the self is not the body, nor is it the mind. One realizes that the self is pure consciousness. One realizes that the self is eternal, infinite, and unchanging.

**The state of pure knowledge is the ultimate treasure, revealing happiness beyond.**

(479)  "Unaffected, only pure light, unimpeded and free from disease.  That which is here, that is the ultimate truth, the rest is merely a wave." (157)

**Meaning:** The pure knowledge that is unaffected, unimpeded, and free from disease, that which exists here, is the ultimate truth; the rest is merely a wave.

**Commentary:** "Pure knowledge is the only light, the rest is mere illusion." - Shri K.D. Saxena, 6-4

Here, the pure knowledge that is unaffected, unimpeded, and free from disease is the ultimate truth. It is free from obstruction and disease due to its formless nature. That is why it is the ultimate truth. Everything else is merely a wave.

In this world, the ultimate, supreme, and most excellent truth is the pure knowledge that shines within. This truth is unaffected, shining within. It is unimpeded, free from any kind of obstruction or suffering, because it is formless and intangible, so no obstruction can touch it. It is also free from disease, free from illness, and perfectly healthy, because it is formless and intangible. Thus, being unimpeded and free from disease, it is the ultimate source of happiness and bliss. Just as a healthy person, free from any obstruction or disease, appears radiant and full of joy, so too, this pure knowledge, free from any obstruction or disease, shines forth in its natural, complete, unimpeded, healthy, and blissful form. This unimpeded, healthy, and natural state of pure knowledge is the ultimate truth. Everything else is merely a wave, a temporary phenomenon, while this pure knowledge remains as the ultimate, unaffected experience.

**Reflection:**  The pure knowledge is unaffected, unimpeded, and free from disease due to its formless nature. It is the ultimate truth, and everything else is merely a wave.

The collection of Gadashti is supreme because there is nothing greater than it, it is the most excellent, it is the best, that is why it is supreme.
And there is only one, pure, non-dual knowledge, which is nothing but a miracle of consciousness. “The infinite, unbreakable, and boundless supreme light is always shining within and without, it is dependent on the surge of consciousness, like a lump of salt, it always remains one and the same. X The lump of salt tastes the same wherever it is tasted, but it always tastes like salt, similarly this knowledge-treasure of consciousness is always experienced as one consciousness.
Pure, enlightened, conscious treasure, self-illuminating, blissful abode; how much more can be said, think and attain it.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhiji. And this supreme, transcendental element is external, it is within, it is situated in the soul, it resides in the father, it is not external to the soul. It is the essence of the soul, and it is its own. It is not necessary to search for it. It is within the soul, it is to be recognized from the soul and revealed. But just as musk is in the navel of the deer, but the ignorant deer is not aware of it, so it runs elsewhere to find it!
Similarly, the ignorant soul, which is within its own soul, which is the soul itself, is not aware of it, so it wanders outside in search of it! But it does not turn inward and look within the father! Thus, the supreme treasure, which is right in front of us, is overlooked by this ignorant world! And it gets lost in its search! It becomes like “the child who goes to find himself”! It is like a blind person who closes his eyes when he comes to an open treasure! They went out to find the treasure, but when they come to the treasure, they say, “Let's see how the blind walk!” So they close their eyes and walk! In doing so, they overlook the treasure – they miss it! And they run ahead to find it! But they do not see the open treasure right in front of them! Similarly, the supreme treasure of infinite knowledge, vision, character, effort, joy, etc., the greatest and most precious of all,
x अखण्डितमनाकुलं बलदनन्तमन्तर्बहि-महः परममस्तु नः सह जमुद्विलासं सदा । चिदुच्छलननिर्भर सकलकालमालम्बते, यदेकरससमुल्लसल्लवणखिल्यलीलायितं ॥"
– Shri Amritchandracharyaji's Samyatsarakalash,

## Steadfast Vision: Karma and its Causes are External to the Soul

(481) This soul, a precious treasure, is revealed before us, completely unveiled. Yet, this ignorant world, like the blind, transgresses it! The reason for this is that they have not received the light of this supreme knowledge. Therefore, enveloped in the darkness of ignorance, they cannot see this ultimate treasure and act like the blind leading the blind!

The world transgresses before the revealed ultimate treasure... O Jinesar! They see without light! The world, blind leading the blind... O Jinesar! Dharma.

- Shri Anandghanji. But those with steadfast vision, those with right vision, have seen this inner revelation, which is beyond the external. They have received the light of the Lord of the World, and therefore they have seen this "revealed ultimate treasure." When such a person with right vision remembers their previous state of ignorance, they laugh at themselves! They think, "We forgot ourselves!" What greater darkness is there than forgetting oneself? Remembering this again and again makes us laugh! But now we will not forget again! The supremely compassionate Shrimad Rajchandraji has said in a very poignant verse:

"You forgot yourself, what darkness is this? Remembering, remembering, now we laugh, we will not forget again." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

This knowledge of the Self is beyond the external, everything else is external, meaning karma, karma's causes, etc., are external to the soul. They do not enter the soul. Because, "Even though a thing with infinite power is revealed, it does not enter another thing. Because everything is determined by its own nature, why is it confused and suffering? There is only one thing here, not another thing. Therefore, that thing is that thing. What is the certainty of one thing about another? What does it do even though it is external? Whatever a thing does to another thing, it is only a change in itself. This is only a practical view, there is nothing else in certainty."

- Shri Amritchandracharya's Samyatsar Kalash.

The aggregate of karma, etc., cannot enter into another thing, because the gross soul is said to be external to the object, it is said to be limited by its own nature, by its own fixed determination. Then, after attaining greatness, what is it that is agitated to change its nature? Because here nothing is another thing, therefore the thing is that thing itself, this is the determination. Even though it is defeated, what does another do to another? And whatever another does to another, which is self-produced, is considered to be so from the point of view of practice, but in reality, it is nothing else here. Thus, karma, etc., are external to the soul, then what is the relationship between the soul and the karma of knowledge-obscuration, etc., the body, etc., and the feelings of attachment and aversion, etc.? For understanding this, it is necessary to think briefly.
Here, the example of the sculptor-craftsman is appropriate - just as a craftsman, etc., performs karma, which is the result of the substance of the necklace, etc., with the help of the instrument, which is the result of the substance of the hammer, etc., he takes hold of the instrument, which is the result of the substance of the hammer, etc., and enjoys the pleasure, etc., which is the result of the substance of the necklace, etc., as the fruit of the karma of the cause and effect. But due to the multiplicity of the substance of the practice, there is otherness-separation from it, so it does not become one with it.
Therefore, only due to the feeling of cause and effect, there is the practice of the doer-karma and the enjoyer-enjoyment. Similarly, the soul also performs karma, which is the result of the substance of merit and demerit, etc., with the help of the mind, speech, and body, which are the result of the substance of the pudgala. It takes hold of the mind, speech, and body, which are the result of the substance of the pudgala, and enjoys the pleasure and pain, etc., which are the result of the substance of the pudgala, as the fruit of the karma of merit and demerit, etc. But due to the multiplicity of the substance, there is otherness-separation from it, so it does not become one with it. Therefore, only due to the feeling of cause and effect, there is the practice of the doer-karma and the enjoyer-enjoyment.
And just as that same craftsman, desiring to work, performs karma, which is the result of the self, according to the effort, and enjoys the fruit of karma, which is the result of the self, with the characteristics of suffering, according to the effort, and due to the multiplicity of the substance, there is otherness-separation from it, so it becomes one with it. Therefore, due to the feeling of result-resultant, there is the determination of the doer-karma and the enjoyer-enjoyment in it. Similarly, the soul also performs karma, which is the result of the self, according to the effort, *"जह सिप्पिओ उ कम्मं कुम्वइ ण य सो उ तम्मओ होइ ।
तह जीवोवि य कम्मं कुव्वदि ण य तम्मओ होइ ।" (See for reference) - Shri Samayasar Ga. 349-355 and the extremely wonderful commentary of Shri Amritchandracharya.

The siddhāṣṭi (perfect being) is like a stone and a wall, the pure form of the soul.
(483) It accumulates karma-phala (fruits of karma) in the form of ātmā-pariṇāma (transformation of the soul) which is characterized by duḥkha-lakṣaṇa (characteristics of suffering). And because of its unique nature, it becomes absorbed in it. Therefore, due to the relationship of cause and effect, it is certain that it performs karma and experiences its fruits. Thus, the soul has a causal-consequential relationship with karma through its actions, and a cause-and-effect relationship with the bhavakarma (karmic actions) due to impure perception. But according to the pure perception of the right view, the soul is free from all karmic stains and impurities, and is pure in nature, "the eternal God himself."

Just as a stone placed on a wall is not part of the wall, but is external to it and distinct from it, so the stone is not part of the wall, it is simply a stone; similarly, the soul, which is the knower, is also a substance like pudgala (matter) in practical terms, but it is external to the knower, distinct from the stone and the wall, so it is not part of the external substance, the knower is like the wall, it is simply the knower, this is certain. Just as the white quality of the stone is its nature to adorn the wall, so the knowledge quality of the soul is its nature to know the object. Just as the stone, in practical terms, is related to the external substance that is the wall, it does not become part of the wall, that is, it does not become the wall, but remains a stone in its own right; similarly, the soul also knows the external substance in practical terms, but it does not become part of the external substance, that is, it does not become the external substance, but remains the knower in its own right. Because that is its nature. (For reference, see Samyāsāra, verses 356-365 and Śrī Amṛtacandracāryaji's extraordinary commentary "Ātmakhyāti").

"Just as a stone is not part of another stone, so too is the soul not part of anything else."
–Śrī Samyāsāra

"Just as a stone is placed on a wall, it is not part of the wall, but is external to it and distinct from it, so the stone is not part of the wall, it is simply a stone; similarly, the body, speech, soul, and mind are not part of karma, but are external to it and distinct from it, so they are not part of karma, they are simply themselves; similarly, the soul is not part of the body, speech, mind, or karma, but is external to them and distinct from them, so the soul is not part of them, it is simply itself."
–Śrī Yaśovijayaji's Sāḍa Trīṁśa, verses, and the knowledge quality of the soul is its nature, so it illuminates the world, but it does not become the world, just as the moon does not become the sky (see page 75). Knowledge always knows the object, but the object never becomes the knower. Thus, the relationship of the knower is such that the soul, which is of the nature of knowledge, remains in its own form and knows the object, which is the world. Thus, the soul is not the body, speech, mind, karma, attachment, aversion, pudgala, or any other substance. The soul is distinct from all of these. All of these are external to it.

The collection of perceptions (gadashtisamuchchay) is an attribute of the soul that is only known by omniscience (kevalgyanati); because, with certainty (nishchay), with pure knowledge (shuddhnay), this soul is unattached (abadhprushta), unique (anany), constant (niyat), without any particular characteristics (avishesha), and uncombined (asanyukt). (See Gatha, Footnote p. 72)
The relationship of the sheath (myan) to the sword is like the relationship of the body to the soul, which has seen the body in its true form (yathathathya). The relationship of the body to the soul, which has seen the soul in its true form, is like the relationship of the sheath to the sword. The great soul (mahat purush) is the same for both life and death, for he has experienced the unattached, clear soul (abadhspasht atma). -Param Atmadashta Shrimmad Rajchandraji.
(1) The soul is attached (badhspasht) due to the expectation of the endless bondage (anadi bandh paryay), but the soul is unattached (abadhskrushta) like a lotus in water, due to the expectation of the soul's nature (atmasvabhav) which is untouchable by matter (pudgal) alone.
(2) The soul is unique (anany) because, although it takes on other forms (anyarup) due to the assumption of other states (naranarkadi anyany paryay), it is always the same pure, undivided soul (atmasvabhav). This is like the nature of clay (mruttika), which remains undivided in all its forms (ghat adi sav paryay). (3)
The soul is constant (niyat) because, although it is impermanent (aniyat) due to the states of growth and decay (vridhi-hani paryay), it is always the same, like the nature of the ocean (samudrasvabhav). (4) Gold appears in many forms (paryayarup) - heavy, yellow, sticky - but if we do not look at it with the perception of forms (paryaydasht) and look at it with the perception of substance (dravya dasht), then only one unbroken gold (kanak) is seen. Similarly, the soul appears in many forms (paryayvishesharup) - knowledge (gyan), vision (darshan), etc. - but if we look at it with the perception of the soul's nature (atmasvabhav) without any particular characteristics (avishesha) and drink the nectar of non-dualistic taste (nirvikalp ras), then only one pure, unstained soul (shuddh nirangan ek atma) is seen. (5) Just as water has a combined heat (sanyuktpan) due to the expectation of the state of heat (ushnatva paryay) obtained from fire (agnisange), but it does not have such a combined heat due to the expectation of the cold nature of water (jalna sheet svabhav) alone; similarly, the soul has a combined state of attachment (mehsanyuktpan) due to the expectation of the state of attachment (mahaparyay) obtained from karma (karmasange), but it does not have such a combined state due to the expectation of the soul's own nature of the seed of bondage (svayam badhbeej svabhav) alone. In other words, the soul is uncombined (asanyukt). Thus, by discarding the perception of forms (paryaydasht) and looking at it with the pure perception of substance (shuddh dravya dasht), the soul is unattached (abadhprushta), unique (anany), constant (niyat), without any particular characteristics (avishesha), and uncombined (asanyukt).
(For reference, see Shree Amritchandracharyaji's Samyasaarika Ga. 14-15) Heavy, yellow, sticky, gold in many waves; do not look at it with the perception of forms, only one unbroken gold remains... The supreme lord of religion (dharam), the vision (darshan), knowledge (gyan), and feet (charan) of the supreme lord (arnaath), are many in their formless nature (alakh svarup); drink the nectar of non-dualistic taste (nirvikalp ras), only one pure, unstained (shuddh nirangan ek) remains... Religion (dharam) - Shree Anandghanji
Such pure (shuddh), unstained (nirangan), one (ek), non-dual (advait) omniscient light (kevalgyanjyot) is the only attribute (abaahya) that is the ultimate essence (antstattva) of the soul. All other attributes (bhavo) are external (baahya) to the soul.

**Steadfast Vision:** “g tension” — all the rest is *upaplap*
(485) It is on the *upaplap* and it is *upaplap* in nature. *Upaplap* means chaos, disaster, all the rest is calamity, misfortune, fear, anxiety, agitation, inauspiciousness, planetary influence, etc. Whatever is experienced or influenced by anything other than pure knowledge, that is truly *upaplap* in nature. Just as a city is thrown into chaos by the invasion of an enemy, chaos spreads, agitation pervades, destruction occurs, wealth is looted, and there is no end to the calamity; similarly, by the invasion of external objects, *upaplap* arises in this conscious being's conscious city, producing a contraction in the form of self-awareness, ignorance spreads like chaos, the treasure of the soul's knowledge, vision, and other virtues is looted, and there is no end to the calamity of endless transmigration. The proverb "The outsider enters and causes destruction" is true here!
"The outsider enters and causes destruction, I believe this proverb is not false." — Shri Shantasudharas.
This influence of karma, etc., is external, truly! It is "external" because it acts like an enemy, it is the enemy of the soul's emotions. The soul has nothing to do with it in terms of its true nature. But due to the influence of the endless past, it becomes attached to it by identifying with it. It goes so far as to become intoxicated with the results of external objects, it is stained by the color of external objects, it is dyed by the color of external objects, and it becomes a consumer and protector of the external, becoming attached to external objects! It is from this color of external results that this being experiences endless suffering. Therefore, this invasion of the external cycle, which is in the form of external influence, is truly *upaplap* in nature, it is a disaster, it is a calamity, it is misfortune, it is a hindrance, it is inauspicious, it is a planetary influence, it is chaos.
External results, intoxication, external color, stained, external consumer, protector, attached to external objects... "I pray to the Lord who protects the world." — Shri Devchandraji.
"There is only one breath, the sign of pure knowledge." — Shri Arsha Vachan.
But the one who has received the light of pure knowledge, the being with right vision, feels that the eternal soul with the characteristics of knowledge and vision is the only reality, the rest is external, it is external to the self, it has nothing to do with the self, there is no connection. Understanding this, he abandons external results and embraces self-results, becoming absorbed in the glory of the pure essence of the self, the true nature, he cuts off the taste of external objects, which are like poison, and becomes strong and healthy by partaking of the taste of his own true nature.

(486).
Ganiramuchchay, pure self-kind essence, immersed in great respect; abandoning the taste of other kinds, drinking the taste of one's own form...world-protector”—Shri Devchandraji.
And such a person who has attained the vision of the supreme self-essence, the ultimate knowledge-tirmy, who has attained self-realization, such a Samyagdarshi man does not have even a trace of doubt. “Knowledge there is no doubt.” Just as the sun's rays spread, darkness does not remain, so too, after the vision of the Supreme Self, even a trace of doubt does not remain, there is complete unshakeable fearlessness, and “suffering is avoided at the door of the body.” Because where there is doubt, there is sorrow, and where there is knowledge, there is no doubt.
“Where there is doubt, there is sorrow, knowledge there is no doubt.” —Shrimad Rajchandraji. Having seen the vision, the Jina, there is no doubt; just as the sun's rays spread, darkness is prevented...pure”—Shri Anandghanji.
Such a fearless, innate, self-form vision, having attained supreme fearlessness, such are the supreme blessed utterances of the great, experienced, Samyagdarshi:
“The true path has been found, doubts have been dispelled; those waters have gone, the self-body has been distinguished.” Nineteen hundred and forty-nine, pure samyakti has shone; heard and experienced, the state is increasing, the self-form has been realized.
Blessed is this day! The unprecedented peace has awakened.” —Shrimad Rajchandraji. “Suffering has been avoided at the door of the body, happiness has met; what treasure is there for the one who has made the mind the treasure?
Pure Jina, having seen, take it today, the desired task in our teachings. Having filled the form, having created it, no comparison is less; the peaceful, good, absorbing it, there is no satisfaction in seeing it...pure.” —Shri Anandghanji.
Thus, the wise, the patient, those devoted to restraint.
Those who strive to abandon the obstacles to Dharma, truly. || 159 || 158
Commentary: - Thus, according to the above principle, - these wise, patient, unwavering, those who are devoted to restraint, with the above characteristics, and - in that way, those who strive to abandon the obstacles to Dharma, truly, - from the root, - thus, by following the above principle, by practicing discrimination, due to the purification, from the root - from the Supreme. Because they are superior, based on the scriptures, as they are described. 

Page #563:
---------------------------
**Standing Firm:**  The wise, with their discerning knowledge and experience, are like swans who do not get entangled in the mire. 
(487)

Thus, the wise and patient, being devoted to Pratyahara, strive to abandon the bondage of Dharma. 
(158)

**Commentary:**  As stated above, according to the principles of ethics, the wise and steadfast, who are free from wavering, are eager to engage in Pratyahara, as described. Due to the purity arising from their discernment, they strive to abandon the bondage of Dharma, motivated by the ultimate truth. 

This is how it happens:

The discerning knowledge mentioned above clearly reveals the distinction between the self and the non-self. It shows that the body, house, and other attachments are external, impermanent, insecure, and impure. They belong to others, not to the self. 

On the other hand, the pure knowledge-light is the only thing that is not external, eternal, secure, and pure. It is the self, the father, not belonging to others. It is the ultimate truth, while everything else is like a mirage, a disaster, and a blinding darkness. 

Therefore, only this pure knowledge-light is worthy of acceptance, while everything else is worthy of rejection. Just as a child mistakenly brings home a garment belonging to someone else, the honest and discerning, righteous person understands that all external attachments and objects should be abandoned. They realize, "I am bound by attachment to these things, so I must abandon this attachment." 

Because the self-consciousness in the body connects the soul to the body, the self-consciousness in the soul separates the soul from the body. This self-consciousness in the body is the root of worldly suffering. Therefore, I should abandon the self-consciousness in the body, which is the focus on the body, and cultivate self-consciousness in the soul. (See page 302).

Thus, through the discernment of the self and the non-self, the knowledge of distinction arises, leading to pure self-knowledge. This grants them the experience of the pure soul. Therefore, "The past, the present, and the future, breaking through the bonds with force, the wise one, if anyone, indeed, contemplates within, dispelling delusion instantly. The glory of the unity of the self and the experience of the self is clearly manifest, this is certain. The eternal one, free from the stain of karma, is himself eternal."

From the Samyasaar Kalash, by Shri Amritchandracharya.

## The Collection of Yogic Insights

This wise and discerning soul, having completely separated himself from future attachments, has overcome the attachment of the senses through intense effort and finally beholds the true nature of the soul. This soul, whose glory is understood only through self-realization, is eternally 'established' and is the self-existent, eternal God, free from all impurities and blemishes. Just as a swan separates milk from water, this self-realized, right-sighted soul distinguishes between the soul and non-soul, separating the self from the non-self. He experiences that the soul, in its essence of pure consciousness, is distinct from the body, just as a garment is distinct from the body, or a sword from its scabbard. He perceives the soul as eternally distinct and separate, and as the manifest, luminous form of consciousness. He understands that the picture gallery is distinct, the bed within it is distinct, the mattress on the bed is distinct, and the sheet on the mattress is also distinct. He understands that his relationship with these external objects is distinct, and that his self-awareness is distinct from them. Understanding this, the right-sighted, discerning soul, abandoning the state of unconsciousness and embracing consciousness, opens his eyes and sees his own true nature. 

"His own qualities are inscribed within him, not the qualities of others.
He separates milk from water, through the experience of the swan.
Bow down to the lotus feet of Parshvanath."

(488)

—Shri Ananddhanaji,

The picture gallery is distinct, the furniture is distinct, the mattress is distinct, the sheet is also distinct. My existence here is false. In the past, I was in a state of sleep, like a dream. The present moment is not a dream, it is a reality.
The breath and the dream are like the sleep from which I have awakened.
I see my own form clearly, like a mirror reflecting my true self.
Abandoning the fear of consciousness, abandoning the state of unconsciousness,
Opening my eyes, I see my own true form.

—Kaviwar Banarasidasji.

C

And what is the form that he sees? I am the soul, in the soul, by the soul. I am the experience of the soul. I am not a neuter, not a man, not a woman, not one, not two, not many. In the absence of this, I was asleep, and in its presence, I have awakened. I am the transcendental, indescribable, self-perceived soul. (See page 280-81) Thus, when the right-sighted soul realizes his true nature, the sleep of ignorance, which has lasted since time immemorial, is dispelled, and the soul, the abode of right knowledge, awakens and rises.

k.

"By the soul, I experience myself, in the soul, by the soul. I am that, not this, not that, not one, not two, not many. In the absence of this, I was asleep, and in its presence, I have awakened. I am the transcendental, indescribable, self-perceived soul."

—Shri Pujyapadaswami, Shri Samadhishatak.

## Right Vision: The Absolute Certainty of the Fearless Knower

(489) "O Jagat Diwakar Shri Namishwar Swami, by seeing your face, the endless errors have fled.
By the right knowledge, the path of virtue is attained, the evil of false beliefs and delusion is abandoned.
The inherent brilliance of wisdom shines forth, it settles in the heart and soul, becoming the means and the goal.
By becoming the seeker, the knowledge is attained, the true nature is established, the essence of Dharma is realized."
- Tatvarangi Mahamuni Shri Devchandraji

Patience - Fearlessness. "How much burden is on your head? Who is the owner of this treasure? Pure..." - Shri Anandghanji.

These right-visioned great souls are wise, therefore they are patient, unshakeable, absolutely fearless. Because the cause of fear and anxiety is ignorance of the true self. But those who have realized the true nature of the Self, these right-visioned individuals know with firm conviction that nothing belongs to anyone else, what is yours is with you, everything else is foreign. "What is yours? What is mine? What is yours is with you, everything else is foreign. So why fear? Why worry? What is the choice?"

"I am different from everything and everyone, I am the only pure consciousness, the supreme, inconceivable bliss, the solitary pure experience. Is there any disturbance? Any choice? Any fear? Any regret? Any other state? Pure, pure, supreme pure, eternally peaceful consciousness, I am only without choice. I am the embodiment of my own nature. I am absorbed in myself. Peace, peace, peace."

Only those with right vision are capable of this supreme courage: when a heavy weight falls and someone is trembling with fear, and the path is being obstructed, then with natural fearlessness, they dispel all doubts. They know themselves to be the embodiment of the infinite knowledge, free from the seven fears, and they are liberated from the fear of death. (See page 68, footnote). And thus, those who have the knowledge-divine, their own unshakeable nature, the supreme, unbroken conviction, they are patient, right-visioned, and they are free from all seven fears. They are absolutely certain because they are (1-2) different from everything...

* This detailed description of the seven fears is given in the Panchadhyayi by Shri Amritchandracharya. The inquisitive should refer to it. Its essence, a concise yet complete description, is beautifully presented by Shri Amritchandracharya in the miraculous Samyatsarekalash, which is based on the supreme, unparalleled, and miraculous Samyatsarekalash. For example:

"O: Eternal, yet moving, the world itself is the only one who sees the world. The world is not yours, yours is not the world, so where is the fear?

The collection of yogic insights is a lake, eternal and devoid of all, the isolated soul. The one who experiences this lake of pure consciousness alone, and contemplates that this upper lake or paradise is not defeated, where does he have fear of this world or the next? Thus, the knower, constantly unshakeable, experiences this innate knowledge always. (3) By the power of the knowable-knower, arising distinctly, an unshakeable knowledge arises, which is itself the knower, this is the only knowledge, there is no other knowledge that has fallen, so where does the knower have fear of knowledge? (4) What is 'sat' (being) is certainly not destroyed, this manifest state is the state of being, and knowledge is itself sat, then what is its salvation from others? Therefore, there is nothing like its salvation, then where does the knower have fear of salvation? (5) 'Self-form' is the truth! The ultimate secret of the object, because no one else can enter the self-form, and innate knowledge, which is uncreated and unartificial, is the self-form. Then there is no secrecy of it. So where does the knower have fear of secrecy? (6) The destruction of the life force is called death, and the life force of this soul is certainly knowledge. It itself, by its eternity, never perishes, therefore, there is no death of it, then where does the knower have fear of death? (7) One such knowledge is eternal and unshakeable, and it is truly self-evident. It is always here, there is no rise of the other, the second, here. Therefore, there is nothing accidental here. Where does the knower have fear of the accidental? The knower, constantly unshakeable, experiences this innate knowledge always. Thus, the knower of right vision, who has escaped the seven fears of this world, etc., is always supremely fearless, supremely unshakeable. Fear itself runs away from them, as if they are afraid of fear!
Pratyahara. "It is the result of karma, O friend, that you are bound by the karmic particles!
The inert world is attached to you, but you do not have any enjoyment, O friend!" - Shri Devchandraji,
The man of right vision is such a wise and patient person, therefore, he is eager in pratyahara, that is, he does not connect his senses with the objects of desire, he withdraws his senses from the objects of desire, he withdraws his soul from the influence of the world, and imitates the self-conscious form, he plays in the maturity of the self-realization, having vomited the traditionalism. He addresses his own soul and says - O soul! O friend! What you are doing is the result of karma, *"Saviddhi nava nirnavada hari nidamatha teni hattam vaghamuji na tahan tu basera ||"—Shri Samyatsar, 

Page #567:
---------------------------
**Steady Gaze:**  "O awakened one, renounce the desires for objects of withdrawal (pratyahara)!"

(491) There is a feeling of "other-becoming" (par-parinaati-bhaav).  O friend, this inert and moving world, this "eth" (eth), does not bring you enjoyment.  All living beings have experienced this "eth" countless times and have left it behind.  It is like their discarded offerings, like "eth."  Who would eat such a manifest impurity, such a particle of "eth"?  And who would corrupt the supreme purity of the Self (aatma-swaroop) of the Father?  Furthermore, O awakened one, this enjoyment of matter (pudgal-bhog) is impermanent, fleeting.  The material objects of enjoyment that seemed pleasant and dear, become unpleasant and repulsive in an instant, because the changes in form, taste, smell, and color bring about corresponding changes and modifications in matter.  The enjoyment obtained from worldly possessions or heavenly possessions is like poison.  Therefore, why would one taste such impermanent, poisonous matter, when one can savor the eternal, delightful, and blissful Self (chaitanya-rasamaya nijaatma-swaroop)?  "The true color is that of the Jineshwar, the world is devoid of color, all others are; the wealth of the king of the gods and the king of men, that is like poisonous matter... The true one, the Jina, enjoys the taste of his own qualities, the objects are deformed by their changes; without the right understanding, the Jina has tasted the pure form... The true one..."  Shri Devchandraji.

The objects of the five senses are extremely painful.  What seems pleasant at the beginning, like the "initial taste of a mango," becomes extremely painful in the end, like the bitter fruit of karma.  This enjoyment is truly like the foam of a snake, suicidal.  There is as much difference between an object and the poison of desire (vishayavasana) as there is between a mountain and a mustard seed.  "Renounce each sense, O awakened one!"  You have seen the terrible consequences of the direct fear experienced by elephants and others due to their being overpowered (see page 318-319).  Then how much more suffering will there be due to the power of the five senses?  Therefore, O Self of pure consciousness and bliss (sachchidanandaatman), renounce the desires for objects and remain in your own nature.  Furthermore, O awakened one, in this endless cycle of existence (anaadi sansaar), you have enjoyed countless pleasures of gods and others, yet you are not satisfied.  Like a hungry person who has never seen a day, you desire the fleeting pleasures of this human life.  How will you ever be satisfied?  The ocean cannot be filled with a bucket of water.  How can the ocean be satisfied with a flood of water?  How can fire be satisfied with a drop of water?  Similarly, a creature is not satisfied even after enjoying endless pleasures for a very long time.  Therefore, renounce these terrible pleasures of the senses that cause thirst and suffering.  Thus, this enjoyment of matter is completely impure, impermanent, painful, and causes thirst and suffering.  And your own nature, O awakened one, is supremely pure, eternal, supremely blissful, and brings about the supreme peace of self-satisfaction.  Therefore, now renounce your attachment to the enjoyment of matter, which is "other-becoming," and savor the enjoyment of your own nature.

The one who has renounced the collection of sensual objects and is disinterested in all worldly things, is awakened to the experience of his own Self, and is delighted by it. He easily abandons the flow of the karmic currents, and this is the manifestation of his refined conduct.
–Shri Devchandraji, etc.

In this way, the Samyakdrishti yogi, who withdraws his senses from worldly objects, is completely detached from the world, and is filled with supreme dispassion. Because… (1)
The yogi who hears the silent Anahata sound, how can he be delighted by the sounds of music and singing? How can he be attracted to the worldly pleasures that are enjoyed by the senses? The one who is absorbed in the music of the soul, how can he be captivated by the sound of the delicate anklets of a woman? (2) The yogi who sees the eternal, pure, and immaculate form, how can he be attracted to the perishable and impure forms created by the planets Shukra and Shani? (3) The one who is delighted by the fragrance of virtue, how can he be pleased by the scents of musk, sandalwood, etc.? Because other fragrances do not last long, they are quickly carried away by the wind, but the fragrance of virtue lasts for a long time and cannot be destroyed by the wind of delusion. (4) The one whose mind is constantly absorbed in the ninth, tranquil rasa, which is unchanging, how can he be attracted to the rasa that is pleasant at the beginning but leads to suffering in the end? The one who tastes the sweet rasa, and whose taste buds are filled with the taste of the rasa, how can he be attracted to the rasa that is bitter and causes pain? The one who is detached from the world, his eyes will shed tears when he thinks of the terrible consequences of worldly pleasures. (5) The one who sleeps in the pure and subtle bed of virtue, where the flowers of virtues are spread, embracing the wife of patience, how can he be attracted to external touch? Thus, these worldly objects are not enjoyable for the detached Samyakdrishti yogi. Indeed, these great souls, having tasted the supreme bliss, have become so indifferent to the world that they are even indifferent to the pleasures of the next world!

Such wise, patient, and detached Samyakdrishti yogis, who are free from worldly attachments, are diligent in renouncing the bonds of worldly duties. They constantly strive to live in accordance with their true nature, so that they do not become bound by worldly duties. They strive to live in accordance with their true nature, so that they do not become bound by worldly duties.

"Except for the evolution of the soul, the mind is disturbed by other subjects. ... The desire remains only in the state of being in the unchanging form of the soul. ... It is indifferent to all other results except the result of the soul."
–Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 492.

Dharma means the nature of the object. "Dharma is the nature of the object." The nature of the soul is Atma-Dharma. Knowledge, vision, and conduct, or simply a pure knowing feeling, is the nature of the soul, so to live in it is Dharma. This is the true Dharma. Or as said in Shri Pravachansar:

"Conduct is Dharma, Dharma is samya, and samya is the result of the soul without attachment and disturbance." Here, "conduct in its form is conduct, meaning activity in its own time. It is Dharma because of its nature. Meaning, it is the pure illumination of consciousness. And it is samya because of its inherent nature. And samya is the result of the soul, which is completely free from all attachment and disturbance arising from the rise of delusion in vision and attachment in conduct." Thus, conduct, Dharma, and samya are all synonymous.

Thus, the knowledge of the soul, the vision of the soul, and the conduct of the soul – these three jewels, the pure Atma-Dharma, are constantly used by the Samyagdarshi jiva, just as no obstacles reach them. The meaning is that it strives to make the soul stay in its pure use as much as possible. This is the true form of Dharma. The rest of the types of practical Dharma are good, virtuous, only if they are conducive to the above-mentioned decisive feeling-Dharma. Without feeling, they are all useless. (See pp. 244-245) The whole world goes around saying "Dharma Dharma", but it does not know the essence of Dharma. Only a few know it. The essence of Dharma is what was said above – to live in one's own nature. When the body-consciousness is abandoned, the soul-consciousness from the body
_x "स्वरूपे चरणं चारित्रं स्वसमयप्रवृत्तिरित्यर्थः । तदेव वस्तुस्वभावत्वाद्धर्मः । शुद्धचैतन्यप्रकाशनमित्यर्थः । तदेव च यथावस्थितात्मगुणत्वात्साम्यम् । साम्यं तु दर्शनचारित्रमोहनीयोदयापादितसमस्तमोहक्षोभाभावादत्यन्तनिर्विकारो जीवस्य परिणाम.।"
–Shri Amritchandracharyaji's Commentary on Pravachansar

(494)
When the collection of wrong views (samyagdasti) goes away and self-knowledge (atmabuddhi) arises in the soul, then you are neither the doer of karma nor the enjoyer of its fruits. This is the essence of Dharma.
“When the attachment to the body (dehadhyas) is gone, you are not the doer of karma;
You are not the enjoyer of its fruits, this is the essence of Dharma.” - Shri Atmasiddhi
Thus, to live in one's own nature (svabhaav) is Dharma, and to live in the state of division (vibhaav) is Adharma. That which is divided (vibhaav) is conditional (nimittik) - it arises from a cause (nimitt), and that cause is related to the object (vishayasangaadik). This impure cause (ashuddha nimitt) causes the soul to wander in the cycle of birth and death (samsara) - to be entangled, and to become the doer of actions (karma). But when this pure, conscious, and luminous soul (chaitanyagana atma) dwells in the pure cause (shuddha nimitt), then it becomes aware of its own nature (nij bhaav).
“The Dharma that you have, which is based on the results (parinaamik), is not our Dharma. Our Dharma is to dwell in the light of faith (shraddha bhaasan raman viyege), and to be free from the attachment to the divided state (valagya vibhaav adharma).
...O Lord! I beg you, color my mind. That which is divided (vibhaav) is conditional (nimittik), the state of continuity (santati bhaav) is beginningless (anaadi); the cause (parnimitt) is related to the object (vishayasangaadik), O Lord! - due to the impure cause (ashuddha nimitt), the soul wanders in the cycle of birth and death (samsara), becoming the doer and enjoyer of actions (karma).
When it dwells in the pure cause (shuddha nimitt), O Lord! - then it becomes the doer and enjoyer of its own nature (karta bhokta gharno)....” - Shri Devchandraji
Thus, knowing this ultimate essence of Dharma and Adharma, the person with right view (samyagdasti) abandons the causes of Adharma, which are in the form of division (vibhaav), and takes refuge in the causes of Dharma, which are in the form of one's own nature (svabhaav). In other words, he takes refuge in the means of growth (vridhi) of right knowledge (samyag jnana), right faith (samyag darshan), and right conduct (samyag charitra). He abandons the causes that hinder the realization of his own nature (atmasvaroop) and takes refuge in the causes that help him realize it. And among these, he takes refuge in the Supreme Lord (parmatma prabhu), who is the pure, natural, and manifest essence of Dharma (shuddha svabhaavaroop vastu dham pragat), with firm faith and devotion (dridh aashrayabhakti), considering him as the ultimate support and foundation (param avlambhanbhoot aadharbhoot). And while worshipping him, he constantly chants (ajpa jap jape) the mantra, “O Lord! O Lord of our innate nature (sahaja anmasvaroop swami)! The pure Dharma that manifests in you, let that pure Dharma manifest in us too....O Lord! By worshipping the pure Lord (shuddha dev), we abandon the external (parhava), and by experiencing the joy of dwelling in our own Dharma (atmadharm raman), our own nature (atma bhaav) manifests....O Lord!” - Shri Devchandraji.

**Stable Insight:** Sinful companions, such as taking, violence, etc., are the source of sin.

**(495)**
And such activity of Samyak Darshan is from the truth, from the ultimate goal, because it has definitely been freed from the knots. Therefore, due to the purity of discrimination, it is considered to be the best Shruta-predominant.

Not indeed Lakshmi, the companion of Alakshmi, is for the joy of the wise, just as the companion of sin in the world is not for the enjoyment of beings. (159)

**Meaning:** Indeed, Lakshmi, the companion of Alakshmi, does not happen for the joy of the wise; similarly, in the world, the companion of sin does not happen for the enjoyment of beings.

**Analysis:** Lakshmi, whose companion is Alakshmi, is not joyful for the wise; similarly, the companion of sin is not joyful for beings who are full of enjoyment.

In common social practice, it is also believed that Lakshmi, whose companion is Alakshmi, i.e., Lakshmi with whom Alakshmi is associated as a companion, Lakshmi as a result of which Alakshmi is obtained, such Lakshmi is not the cause of joy for a wise person. Because the companion of sin is Lakshmi, which gives Alakshmi in return, which earns money that is wasted and gives poverty, and finally burns and goes away, how can a wise person be happy with such Lakshmi? Similarly, sin is the companion-friend of all kinds of enjoyment. There is such a close friendship between enjoyment and sin, such a deep attachment, that wherever there is enjoyment, there is always sin present as a companion-friend. That is, enjoyment cannot happen without sin, both of them have an inseparable relationship that cannot exist without each other. Such beings who have sin as a friend or who are friends of sin, who are full of enjoyment, are not joyful, and sin is from the past, that is the feeling. And from sin...

**Translation:** Not - not at all, Amitavi Lakshmi - Lakshmi, the companion of Alakshmi, or Lakshmi whose companion is Alakshmi, in this way, from both parts, Yathanandaya Dhimatam - in the same way as the joy of the wise, in the same way, Pavarghana - the companion of sin, or those whose companion is sin, Hoje - in the world - from its inseparable nature, Fehina Movistar - the enjoyment of beings, does not happen for joy, enjoyment cannot happen without the past being born, and sin is from the past, that is the feeling.

The collection of harmful views is suffering. How can happiness arise from such sinful actions that lead to further suffering? Shrimad Rajchandraji's profound and enlightening words are:
"Do not be entangled in worldly possessions, let compassion remain in you. Renunciation is the principle, and suffering that follows is not happiness." - Shri Mekshamala

All types of enjoyment are sinful. Because, in their origin, their attainment, and their consumption, there is nothing but sin, sin, and sin: (1) The origin of all types of worldly enjoyment cannot occur without causing harm and violence. To produce sinful enjoyment, one must engage in the act of acquiring and possessing, because no material for the five senses can be obtained without acquiring and possessing.

Whether it is the object of the sense of touch, the object of the sense of taste, the object of the sense of smell, the object of the sense of sight, the object of the sense of hearing, or any other object, no enjoyable thing can be produced without harming and killing animals. For this, the example of food is sufficient. To satisfy this two-inch tongue, how much violence is committed in the world? To satisfy the sense of taste, how many mute and innocent creatures are killed? For the sake of the momentary taste of meat-eaters, this so-called civilized world is slaughtering millions of animals every day! The production of alcohol, etc., also involves such terrible violence, yet these people, laughing and consuming it, become intoxicated and revel in their madness, considering themselves cultured (civilized) and not ashamed! Similarly, for silk, etc., soft fabrics, how much cruel violence is inflicted on the silkworm, everyone who knows its process knows this. For wool, leather, etc., for feathered and furry animals, for the "fat hat" (monkey crown!) gentleman, etc., millions of animals are sacrificed in a deadly manner, and then these shameless human-animals cover their distorted, deformed, and disfigured bodies with these garments, and then they look in the mirror and admire how beautiful they look! But these fools do not know that:
"What does the face see in the mirror, compassion and righteousness are not in the heart." - Shri Kabirji

Furthermore, to avoid becoming the object of suffering themselves, they consume cod liver oil, chicken essence, etc., which are made by sacrificing millions of innocent animals, and these people consume these violence-tainted medicines with a smile! As if they are going to attain immortality, they close their eyes and gulp down bottles and bottles of these medicines into their stomach, and even though they may try all sorts of remedies, in the end, they die! These are all examples, but any...

##  **Steadfastness:**  **Dharma-born possessions are also a source of harm** (497)

There is no smallest item of enjoyment whose origin is free from violence. Thus, violence pervades all possessions; and violence is the greatest sin, so sin is always intertwined with all possessions.

(2) Moreover, to obtain these possessions—the means of enjoyment—humans often have to acquire wealth through sin, they have to engage in *arambha-parigraha* (acquisition of possessions), and thus commit even greater sins. There are hardly any occupations for earning money that are free from sin and truly virtuous. Among them, occupations like fire-related work, forest-related work, etc., are particularly sinful, extremely harmful, and are to be avoided by the soul—they are to be abandoned from afar. Thus, there is great sin in acquiring wealth, which is the means of enjoyment. (3) Similarly, there is great sin in the consumption of possessions, because when enjoying these possessions, the desires for objects of form, taste, etc., increase the passions of attachment, aversion, pride, etc., in the soul. This leads to the destruction of the soul's virtues, resulting in self-inflicted violence, and the soul experiences a terrible death of emotions every moment. This is an obvious sin. Instead of attaining happiness, it leads to its destruction, "A little bit, a little bit, moment by moment, terrible death of emotions, oh, how can one remain content?"—Shri Moksha Mala.

Thus, there is sin in the origin of possessions, sin in acquiring them, and sin in their consumption. Therefore, it is truly said that possessions are intertwined with sin, and that is why, for the soul seeking liberation, all activities related to possessions are to be avoided, and *arambha-parigraha*, which is the means of enjoyment, is also to be abandoned. Knowing this, the truly steadfast, right-sighted person constantly strives to stay away from all activities related to the enjoyment of objects, and minimizes *arambha-parigraha* as much as possible.

★

To dispel the notion that possessions are good because of Dharma, it is said:

**"Even from Dharma, possessions are mostly for harm to embodied beings. Even sandalwood, when born, burns in the fire."** (160)

**Explanation:**

**"Even from Dharma..."**—Even possessions arising from Dharma, mostly, due to their abundance, cause harm to embodied beings, in the same way as pleasure. The word "mostly" implies that it is not referring to possessions arising from pure Dharma (those who acquire wealth purely through Dharma—those who attract it), but to those that are not virtuous, due to their nature of being a means of pleasure, extremely harmful, due to their impurity, and due to the involvement of desires in the pursuit of virtue, etc., which leads to the corruption of the mind. "Even sandalwood..."—Just as sandalwood, which is cool in nature, when born, burns in the fire, so too, due to its inherent nature, possessions are mostly like this. (Even though) it is not wood, but fire—due to the fire being refined from the truth, it burns the sandalwood. This is a clear example.

Even from Dharma, the fruits are often for the benefit of others; even from sandalwood, fire burns here, 160
Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
Ah—Even the fruits produced from Dharma often benefit others. Even the fire produced from sandalwood burns.
Discussion
“Even from cool sandalwood, fire burns like a forest; even the fruits born of Dharma here, cause harm to the mind....” (Sri Cha Sazja 1-5)
.
In the above, only a part of the fruits was called sinful, and therefore, the seeker of liberation was forbidden from them, but what about the fruits obtained from Dharma-from merit? This question has been answered here that even from Dharma, that is, from the good deeds, the fruits obtained from the rise of merit, the fruits born of Dharma, even the fruits obtained in the realm of gods, humans, etc., are often for the benefit of others, because they cause such pleasure. Here, “often” is said to exclude the part of those who accuse pure Dharma-those who pull it down, because such fruits are not pleasure-seeking, and they have the purity of the Tirthankaras, etc., who are extremely innocent, and they have the purity of the Tirthankaras, etc., who are extremely innocent, and they have the purity of the Tirthankaras, etc., who are extremely innocent, and they have

**Steadfast Vision: The Joyful Life of Gods and Others**

(49). As if emerging from the depths of the ocean of death, these gods instantly become youthful. Just as someone wakes up from a pleasant sleep, shaking off their drowsiness, these gods rise from their birth-bed, open their eyes, and behold the supremely delightful heavenly realm and its abundant treasures. They are filled with wonder and contemplate: "Oh! In the past, I practiced severe austerities in a distant land, and through compassion, I granted refuge to living beings. With a pure mind, I worshipped the fourfold path of vision, knowledge, conduct, and liberation, and I revered the omniscient Lord of the universe. I burned down the forest of worldly desires, vanquished the enemy of lust, cut down the trees of passions, and controlled the enemy of attachment. All this has had its effect, for today I have been rescued from misery and established in the divine heavenly kingdom."

"Every moment, new colors, songs of victory forever, red songs, a body without seven metals, beautiful and delightful, red. A body extremely delicate, wise and learned, red. Free from worldly anxieties and fears, peaceful like the night, red. The fruits of virtue bring happiness, the mind always rejoices, red. The land of the heavenly realm forever, happiness and virtues are embraced, red. The king of the gods, the conscious one, the cause is virtue, red. The cause, the completed austerities, the blessings of feet and charity, red. The desire of the devotee of Shiva, what he doesn't like, red. This is the destruction of happiness, count the sorrows, red."

–Sri Devchandraji's translation of Sri Jnanarnava. And then, with the happiness born of virtuous deeds, they enjoy the heavenly wealth they have obtained. There is such an abundance of pleasures of the five senses that they become completely immersed in them, engrossed in enjoyment, so much so that they are oblivious to anything else. Day and night, they spend their lives in pleasure! They don't even know where their time goes! Alas! Their long lifespan, as vast as countless oceans, also slips away like water, unnoticed! Only when six months of their lifespan remain do they feel the withering of their garland of flowers, their eyes begin to blink, their vision dims, and they realize: "Oh! My end is near. Alas! I have wasted my life in worldly pleasures and enjoyment: "This beautiful heavenly realm! These divinely beautiful celestial maidens! These supremely loving friends..."

"Oh Gods! This devotee servant! This Nandana garden! These Kalpa trees! This complete material of the five senses! Oh dear! I must leave all this behind now. When will I see this again?"  Thus, filled with inner sorrow, he is immersed in the ocean of worry, and like the last six months, he spends his days in anxiety and restlessness. Thus, in the heavenly realms, life is often spent in pleasure, indulging in the enjoyment of the fruits of Dharma, and due to this corruption of form, the soul becomes devoid of its true purpose.

Let us leave aside the talk of these heavenly realms, and consider the state of human beings, who are directly visible. Even there, the same thing is evident. If we examine the inner life of a king who has attained the highest state of wealth and prosperity through intense merit, we find that he is so engrossed in worldly pleasures and royal concerns that he appears to be completely lost in enjoyment and fallen. He has no time for Dharma! He has no leisure! Not only that, but this great soul, who is lying on a bed of flowers, the burden of the kingdom, is hardly aware that there is something called Dharma in the world! He forgets the source of his good fortune, the very Dharma that has bestowed upon him this wealth and prosperity, and this ungrateful creature, this miserable being, indulges in pleasure and loses himself in it! Unhappy lies the head, that wears the crown.

The life of a king, etc., is a life of pleasure, or rather, it is a state of misery.

Consider a wealthy man, who is blessed with great wealth and possessions. He too is in the same state, because the comforts of his home, his garden, and his carriage, the servants who are always at his beck and call, the milk that is readily available when he asks for water, all these things lead him to a life filled with pleasure. Because he is entangled in the mire of his own wealth, his possessions, and his comforts, he is completely lost in them. He is so engrossed in enjoying the fleeting pleasures of this life, which are like the moonlight that lasts only for four days, that he has become completely oblivious to everything else. He is so eager to grab every pleasure that life has to offer, that he has become completely intoxicated by it. He is so lost in his wealth that he is unaware of the existence of Dharma in the world! He is so intoxicated by his wealth that he has become completely blind to everything else. He has applied the ointment of "Chittasthata" to his chest, and he is so arrogant that he thinks he is looking at the stars in the sky!

The wealthy are in the same state!

**Steady-sighted, exceptional Tirthankaras and other virtuous people (101) walk around like fools, or they consider the entire world as insignificant as grass in front of their father! Oh! Even though they are fools themselves, they laugh at and insult true pandits, capable and learned people! And either these poor rich people are so entangled in the web of attachment they have woven themselves, so engrossed in the hustle and bustle of sinful businesses like mills and factories, so consumed by the pursuit of wealth accumulated through the sweat of others, so lost in the intricacies of how to tie up and store this wealth, so busy in the frenzy of accumulating piles of money to leave behind, that these poor fools, who are engaged in worldly pursuits, do not even take a moment of peace! They do not sleep peacefully at night, consumed by worry! And these honeybees of wealth and honey, who accumulate wealth and honey, deprive themselves of enjoying it! The honeycombs of wealth that they build are as if they are meant to be left behind for others, they become altruistic! They become beggars, taking from others! But they forget the Dharma from which this wealth has been, is being, and will be obtained! Truly! It is difficult to find a more pitiable creature in the world than a rich man. It is possible for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, but it is not possible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, this is the meaning of the words of the great Mahatma Jesus Christ in the Bible, which are applicable here - 'It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.' If you have worldly happiness, if you have pride, if you have self-importance, what is the use of it? If you have the strength of youth, if you have comfort and ease, if you have wealth, what is the use of it? It is just a life of pleasure and indulgence! If you have maturity and enlightenment, if you have servants like Daksh, if you have the happiness of the spiritual realm, as Raychand says, without embracing the true Dharma, know that happiness is just a fleeting pleasure, like a nut that is quickly consumed.”**

– Shrimad Rajchandraji says that in heaven or in the human realm, wherever wealth is obtained through the accumulation of merit due to Dharma, life is often spent in pleasure and indulgence, and the true nature of the soul is forgotten. As a result, the wealth accumulated through Dharma becomes useless for the soul, it becomes harmful, it becomes a source of deprivation and drying up of the soul; therefore, this wealth obtained through Dharma is often harmful, it is painful from the perspective of the soul.

Here, the word "often" is used to indicate that this is not always the case, but it is a common occurrence for those who are attracted to and embrace pure Dharma.

The term "Samyagdristi-samuccaya" is an exception to the accumulation of merit based on virtuous actions, because it involves "pramada" (delusion), which is not corrupted by the awareness of one's true self. The exceptional case of Tirthankara and other highly enlightened beings with Samyagdristi is different. These virtuous individuals attain the Tirthankara status and other meritorious fruits due to their inconceivable accumulation of merit. Even while living as householders, they consume the accumulated wealth obtained through virtuous actions, but they remain completely detached, thus not getting bound. Just as dry mud does not stick to a dry wall, these detached individuals do not get bound by karma, but rather experience "nirjara" (shedding of karma) and become free from "bhogakarma" (karma related to enjoyment). Despite being amidst the "bhog-panka" (mire of enjoyment), they remain completely detached like a lotus in water. This is their extraordinary and remarkable characteristic! For ordinary people, enjoyment leads to karmic bondage, but for these extraordinary and exceptional Tirthankara and other enlightened beings with Samyagdristi, it leads to "nirjara." Therefore, the rules applicable to ordinary people do not apply to these extraordinary and exceptional individuals. They are exceptions to the rule. The English proverb "Exception proves the rule" applies here. Just as everyone can walk on a highway, but only a few can walk on a narrow path, similarly, these Tirthankara and other enlightened beings, who are completely detached from worldly desires, remain focused on Dharma even while enjoying worldly pleasures. Their minds are always centered on Dharma, and they are deeply immersed in the awareness of their true self. (See pages 274-275). "Even though the mind of ordinary people is filled with desires, they remain detached throughout the three periods of time. Their minds are like the ocean, which cannot be captured by any hook... May Shri Shreyans bless you!" - Shri Yashovijayji.

From the above, it is clear that the consumption or non-consumption of worldly objects is not the main characteristic of detachment, but rather the state of detachment itself. If someone does not consume worldly objects but lacks detachment and harbors desires for enjoyment within their heart, then that is not detachment. On the other hand, if someone consumes worldly objects but is detached, knowledgeable, and free from karmic bondage, and does not harbor desires for enjoyment within their heart, then that is true detachment. Among these, the combination of non-consumption of worldly objects and detachment is the best. However, there are exceptional cases of highly enlightened beings with Samyagdristi who, despite being detached, may still consume worldly objects due to their past karma. This is also a manifestation of their "nirjara."

नर्माता वैषं नोर्तानां विदुते ” - Shri Adhyatmasar

**Stithi:** The ignorant are bound by everything, the wise by nothing.
(503) This does not affect detachment. Therefore, "There is no rule for the production of bondage from objects. The ignorant are bound by them, the wise are never bound - they are free; because the wise, even while enjoying, do not enjoy - even while accumulating, do not accumulate! And "the ignorant, even while not enjoying, enjoy" - even while not experiencing, experience! This is a surprising but true event. * Because just as someone does business on behalf of a merchant who is not present - makes transactions, but he does not become the owner of any profit or loss, he has nothing to do with his profit or loss, he is only a servant to the letter; and the merchant himself sits and does nothing, yet he is the owner of the profit and loss, the owner of the profit and loss; similarly, a wise man with right vision, even while enjoying the objects received from the fruition of past karma, due to the absence of emotions like attachment, etc., is not the owner of the fruits of enjoying the objects - he is not the enjoyer; and the one with wrong vision, even while not enjoying the objects, due to the presence of emotions like attachment, etc., is the owner of the fruits of enjoying the objects - he is the enjoyer.
Thus, a wise man with right vision enjoys but is not bound, and his karma is naturally free! And the ignorant are bound by enjoying! Because "while consuming the objects, due to the arising of seven types of pleasant and unpleasant pain, the soul naturally experiences the feeling of knowledge and detachment, which is pleasant or unpleasant. But when it experiences, the power of wrong vision, due to the good feeling of emotions like attachment, etc., becomes the cause of bondage, and even though it is naturally free, it remains undigested and becomes bound; but the right vision, due to the absence of emotions like attachment, etc., does not become the cause of bondage, and it becomes naturally free by being completely digested. * Thus, even while enjoying, one is not bound by karma! It is the power of knowledge or the power of detachment: (1) Just as a physician does not die by eating poison, similarly, a wise man enjoys the karmic matter, but is not bound. A poison doctor, even while eating poison, which is the cause of death for others, due to the power of his knowledge, he is not affected by it. * "विषयाणां ततो बंधजनने नियमोऽस्ति न । अज्ञानिनां ततो बंधो ज्ञानिनां तु न कर्हि चित् ॥ सेवतेऽसेवमानोऽपि सेवमानो न सेवते । कोऽपि पारजनो न स्याच्छ्रयन् परजनानपि ॥"
–Shri Yashovijayji's Shri Adhyatmasar, "सेवंतोवि ण सेवइ असेवमाणोवि सेवगो कोई। વાળા #વિ જ ય પાચળોત્તિ દો.”–Shri Kundkundacharyaji's Shri Samyasar.
* To understand this topic in detail, refer to the verses 194-198 of Shri Samyasar and the beautiful Atmakhyati commentary of Shri Amritchandracharyaji on them, as well as the Virama Adhikar of Shri Adhyatmasar.
+ "तत् ज्ञानव सामर्थ्य विराळथ ज वा वाजी यत्कोऽपि कर्मभिः कर्म भुञ्जानोऽपि न बध्यते ॥"
–Shri Amritchandracharyaji's Shri Samyasar Kalash.

The power of right faith (Samyag Darshan) is not destroyed by death; just as ignorant people, due to their attachment to passions (ragadi bhavas), are bound by their past karma, which ripens and is consumed, yet the wise, through their invincible knowledge (Jnana Samarthya), are not bound by the passions, even though they experience them, because of the power of their right faith. - This is the power of knowledge. (2) Just as a man who drinks honey does not become intoxicated due to his lack of desire, similarly, the wise are not bound by the consumption of matter (dravya) due to their lack of desire. If a man, despite having a strong desire for liquor, does not become intoxicated due to the power of his strong aversion, similarly, the wise, due to their strong aversion to all objects (dravya), are not bound by the consumption of objects, even though they experience them, due to the power of their strong aversion. - This is the power of detachment (Vairagya).

Thus, the story of the wise men with right faith (Samyag Darshan), like the Tirthankaras, is different. Even though they are driven by past karma and remain in the world due to the ripening of their past actions (Prarabdha Uday), they are still beyond the world (Asansari), and even though they experience the world, they are not bound by it. They have the ultimate detachment (Nitt Vairagya) towards the world. Because their body is a plaything in the world, it dies, but their mind is in liberation (Moksha). As Shriman Haribhadrasuriji has said,
“Moksha is in the mind, not in the body.”

The activities of the wise who are in the world are like the dances of puppets in a puppet show, they are not binding. And this "Yoga Maya" is for the purpose of grace (Kanugraha). Other philosophers also say this, and there is no fault in it.
“The activities of the wise are like the dances of puppets in a puppet show. The wise are not bound by the world.” - Shri Adhyatma Saar.

And we don't need to go far to find an example of such an exceptional, supremely powerful, wise soul with right faith (Samyag Darshan). We can find a shining example of this in the life of Shrimad Rajchandraji, the supreme seer of truth, who lived in the present age. This supremely wise man with right faith (Samyag Darshan) had to remain in the world due to the ripening of his past actions (Prarabdha Uday), even though he did not want to, but every moment he was completely detached from the world.
“Just as a man who drinks honey does not become intoxicated due to his lack of desire, similarly, the wise are not bound by the consumption of matter (dravya) due to their lack of desire.” - Shri Samayasar.
“Just as a man who drinks honey does not become intoxicated due to his lack of desire, similarly, the wise are not bound by the consumption of matter (dravya) due to their lack of desire.” - Shri Vandittasutra.

**Steadfast Vision:** Even the portion arising from Dharma is harmful, like sandalwood in fire.
(505) There was immense regret, and even the great sages were experiencing a rare state of supreme indifference, an extraordinary state of detachment, and intense self-awareness. They were experiencing unbroken self-absorption - this is clearly evident to an impartial observer from their soul-filled words. But such exceptional (Exceptional -Extraordinary) great souls with a pure vision like a lotus in mud are rare, extremely rare. It is not possible for others to fathom or imitate the ocean of their minds, which are free from attachment to the three periods of time. If they try to do so, they will only be consumed by their own nature. In this regard, the words of Shrimad Rajchandraji are very meaningful:
“It is difficult to desire to be free from the objects of desire like sense objects, and even if one tries to do so, it is difficult to prevent the emergence of attachment to those objects. This is because without knowledge, it is not possible to completely eliminate the objects of desire. Simply experiencing the arising of the object of desire leads to its destruction; but if there is no knowledge, then the desire for the object will not cease without producing a strong result, and instead of being defeated, the object of desire will increase. A man who has knowledge does not engage in the objects of desire, nor does he desire to be free from them by experiencing them. And if he does engage in them, it is appropriate for knowledge to be covered. It is only because of the arising of karma that he cannot escape, and therefore the knowledgeable man engages in enjoyment. Even then, it is accompanied by regret before and after, and the weakest of results. An ordinary seeker of liberation, when he engages in the objects of desire, is likely to be bound by them, because the knowledgeable man has barely won over that situation. A man who only has the state of thought does not have the strength to overcome the object of desire in that way.” – Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter No. 499 (591).
Thus, in general, it is a rule that even enjoyment arising from Dharma becomes harmful, but it is an exception that it does not happen to the special knowledgeable men with right vision. Here, the example of sandalwood is appropriate. Sandalwood is naturally cool. Yet, sandalwood fire burns the forest, because it is its nature. Similarly, Dharma also burns, but even though it is naturally cool and peaceful, enjoyment arising from Dharma also produces burning. In rare exceptions, sandalwood is not burned by the fire of a mantra-enchanted man, because he has been purified by the mantra. Similarly, some exceptional great men like Tirthankaras and others with right vision are not harmed by enjoyment arising from Dharma. Because such souls, who are masters of their own selves, have eliminated the poison of desire with a detached attitude. Therefore, the poison of enjoyment does not affect them! Other ignorant people...

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
That which is the cause of the inflow of asrava-karma, is the same that is the cause of the outflow of parisrava-karma!
"Not by abandoning, but by abandoning, one abandons." - Shri Acharanga Sutra
"It is not by abandoning, but by abandoning, that one abandons. There is no doubt in this; it is only a mistake of the drishti, a mistake of the past." - Shrimad Rajchandraji
From the above, it follows that for a person with samyak-drishti, even the portion of dharma generated by the mind appears undesirable, and even the accumulation obtained from punya-adaya appears unreal, because he understands well that this enjoyment of objects is the cause of the dharma-generated portion that corrupts the soul in the form of delusion. Therefore, he does not desire to be attached to it. Understanding this, he does not even desire these objects of enjoyment, and therefore he runs away from them. But if, due to past karma, he cannot avoid them completely, then he remains constantly vigilant and enjoys them with detachment, without identifying with them, and thus he exhausts that karma, but does not become attached to it! He behaves as if he were merely a witness, observing the play of the pudgala-dhatu, with only drishti-bhava, as a witness.
And—
"Viraati from the desire for enjoyment, for the sake of removing the burden of the skandhas. The attachment to other skandhas is due to the conditioning of those samskaras." (161)
Explanation: - From the enjoyment of objects, viraati - its - the desire for its portion, - immediately, what? It is for the sake of skandha-bharapanutthaye - removing the burden of the skandhas, skandha-antar-samaraapa - attachment to other skandhas occurs, which is actually wrong, for what reason? Because - tat-samskara-vidhanant - due to the conditioning of those samskaras, thus, due to the conditioning of those samskaras, which are undesirable, the desire for them is not abandoned.
Thus, the fifth drishti is explained. In this drishti, other yoga-acharyas have also described the qualities of alaulya - non-greed, etc. They have said that -
"Alaulya, health, harshness, good smell, little urine and feces, radiance, grace, sweetness of voice, are the first signs of yoga-pravritti.
"Being free from attachment to objects, with friendliness, etc., being endowed with strength, patience, and courage, being unmoved by dualities, being free from desires, being beloved by people, and so on, are the highest qualities.
"The absence of faults, supreme satisfaction, the yoga of beauty, equality, and the destruction of the skandhas, are the signs of a yogi."
And so on.
Meaning: - (1) Alaulya - non-greed, (2) Arogya - health, (3) Anishthurapana - harshness,

**Stable Vision:**  Desire does not cease through indulgence.
(507) Indulgence itself creates karma.
Removing the darkness, the burden is shifted, 161. Meaning: - Indulgence is like shifting the burden from one shoulder to another, due to the creation of karma.
The intellect will say that desire will cease through indulgence, that boredom and detachment will arise from indulgence. This is also wrong. Because ceasing desire through indulgence is like shifting the burden from one shoulder to another, because the karma continues. Just as a burden-bearer gets tired of lifting the burden on one shoulder, and so shifts it to the other shoulder, but does not put it down; similarly, a seeker of pleasure gets tired of one object, and so ceases his desire for it and takes hold of another object, but does not give up the fundamental desire for objects. Therefore, desire cannot cease through indulgence. Because the karma of indulgence has not been shed - the desire has not been abandoned, therefore, there is only a shift from one object to another. Thus, the cessation of desire that comes from indulgence is only a form of non-cessation of desire, because the attachment to desire continues! *
Knowing this, a person with right vision stays away from the desire for pleasure; he abandons the desire for objects, he abandons the desire for objects, and perhaps due to the force of past karma, he enjoys the fruits of his good karma, but he does so without attachment, without the feeling of "I" and "mine", like a lotus flower in water, remaining unstained. Therefore, he does not get bound by it, and he is freed from the fruits of his karma. This is the first sign of the four good qualities of a person with right vision: (4) good smell, (5) little urine and feces, (6) a mind filled with friendliness, (7) a mind that is not affected by poison, (8) a powerful mind, (9) and a mind filled with joy. (10) Indifference to worldly affairs - not being disturbed by good and bad, gain and loss, etc. (11) And popularity - this is the second sign. (12) The removal of faults, (13) and complete satisfaction, (14) the right way of life, (15) and great equanimity, (16) the destruction of hatred, etc., (17) and a mind filled with truth - these are the signs of the developed force. Here too, this natural group of qualities should be connected from here (from this vision). x "सिद्धथा विषयसौख्यस्य वैराग्यं वर्णयति ये । मतं न युज्यते तेषां यावदर्थप्रसिद्धितः।
अप्रासत्वभ्रमादुच्चैरवाप्तेष्वप्यनंतशः। कामभोगेषु मूढानां समीहा नोपशाम्यति ॥ विषयैः क्षीयते कामो नेधनैरिव पावकः । प्रत्युत प्रोल्लसच्छक्तिर्भूय एवोपवर्धते ॥"

The collection of the five senses is a wondrous phenomenon. Because it does not get entangled with the pudgala, being the pure form of the self, the knower of the senses. And all this is the form-taste-smell-touch-sound pudgala, knowing that it is "Avadhu! Nat Nagar's game," it only sees it as a witness, and enjoys it for free! Because the one who is the devotee of the glory of the treasure of bliss, why would he have any hope for the object?
Partially, this is imperishable, the pudgala net is all-pervading; the devotee of the glory of the treasure of bliss, why would he have any hope for the object? That quality", Da, Saza.1-6 We see the world, the world's play, sitting for free. "Shrimad Rajchandraji.
UR
The qualities obtained through yogasadhana, these five senses, and other qualities like Alelupya, etc., which other yogacharyas have also mentioned, also decrease, in this way - (1) Alelupta-Samyagdristi, the man has no desire for the object, or it is very weak, the four activities have gone away, so he does not have any desire for the object. The first sign of Samyagdristi, the jiva does not get attached to the object, nor does he become greedy for it. He enjoys the enjoyment obtained from the previous prarabdhaudaya without attachment, without any desire. (2) Arogya-The effect of yogasadhana, Samyagdristi has health. The mind-speech-body are purified, and due to the lack of desire for the object, the disease is destroyed and does not occur. Health is obtained. (3) Anipparpana-The mind-result of Samyagdristi becomes very gentle, it becomes wet with compassion and mercy. So there is no kind of selfishness in it, but there is only gentleness like a flower, softness and compassion. As Devchandraji has sung, "This is the behavior of the result of compassion." (4) Shubhagandha-The yogi man, due to the effect of yogasiddhi, his body also becomes fragrant, and the radiance and happiness also increase. (5) Ap Mutra-Purisha-Yagasadhana, there is a process in the body due to which the body's waste dries up and the stool and urine also become less, the small and large intestines become small. Etc. are the first signs of the four activities, the first sign of the four activities. All these signs appear at the beginning of yogasadhana.

##  **Sthirashti: Qualities attained through Yoga Sadhana**
(509)
(6) **Maitri Adi Yukta Chitta** - The mind is filled with feelings of Maitri (friendliness) and other virtues due to the Yoga Sadhana practiced in the previous life. (7) **Vishayee Pratye Achet** - The mind is indifferent to objects. (8) **Prabhavavantapan** - Due to the influence of Yoga, the Yogi exhibits a unique aura that makes others feel awestruck. This aura creates a spontaneous impression of the Yogi being a powerful and influential person. (9) **Dhairya Vantpan** - The Yogi possesses extraordinary and divine patience due to complete self-reliance and perfect vision. (10) **Adhrushta** - The Yogi is unaffected by dualities like pleasure-pain, attachment-aversion, gain-loss, honor-dishonor, love-hate, birth-death, etc. In other words, the Yogi is not disturbed, moved, agitated, afraid, or panicked by these dualities. These dualities cannot influence the Yogi. (11) **Janpriyatva** - Such a Yogi is popular among people. Their presence brings joy to people, and they are loved naturally. They are considered **Priyadarshan** (pleasing to behold). These are some of the signs of a Yogi.

**Shweera Prabhavi, Aagle Chagthi, Mitra Adi Yukta Chitta;**
**Labh Ishta Na Rai Dwandva Ashta, Janpriyata Hai Nitya.... Dhan Dhan**
- Shri Chag S. 6-2.

(12) **Dosha Vyapya** - The vices like attachment, aversion, and delusion are eliminated or significantly reduced. As the firmness of **Samyag Darshan** (right vision) increases, the power of these three vices (attachment, aversion, and delusion) weakens. (13) **Param Tripti Nishpann** - The Yogi experiences ultimate satisfaction from the bliss arising from the realization of the Self through Yoga. The Yogi is so fulfilled and content with the taste of pure consciousness that they are no longer attracted to worldly pleasures.

They only accept truth and are never clouded by delusion.

Yogadristi Samuchaya reveals the right vision (Samyagdristi) of the intellect. This Ritambhara intellect is also called Pratij Jnana. It is superior to Shruta Jnana and Anuman, because Shruta and Anuman are general in nature, while Ritambhara is specific. This Ritambhara intellect arises from the bliss of the soul (Adhyatma Prasada) and manifests from extreme purity of the soul. All these are the characteristics of accomplished yoga, and they manifest from the fifth vision onwards.
“Destruction of faults, supreme satisfaction is attained, equality is the appropriate combination; destruction of hatred, Ritambhara intellect, this is the accomplished... wealth, wealth, the essence of yoga, which is described in the scriptures, as per the Yogachar, from the fifth vision onwards, this is the essence... wealth, wealth.”
Shri Sazha 6-3-4
The essence of the fifth stable vision is that in this stable vision: (1) the vision is like a jewel, eternal and unchanging, (2) the fifth restraint called Pratyahar is attained, (3) the fifth mental defilement called Branti is eradicated, and (4) the five virtues called Suphmad are obtained.
The wise person with this vision has overcome the darkness of ignorance (Tamogranthi), and therefore sees the entire world in its true form. All worldly activities appear to this wise person like the dust of a child, unsubstantial and unstable. Due to the discrimination gained from the perfectly matured Shruta Jnana, all external emotions appear like a mirage, a Gandharvanagar, and a dream. The only knowledge-light that is external and internal, without any obstacles and without any defects, is the ultimate truth here. Everything else is a delusion. This Samyagdristi, who has developed this discrimination, is steadfast, virtuous, and devoted to Pratyahar, meaning they withdraw their senses from objects and do not get attached to worldly desires. They are careful to not violate Dharma and are devoted to the truth.
- Just as Lakshmi, the companion of misfortune, does not bring joy to the wise, similarly, the beings who are attached to pleasure and enjoyment do not find joy in sin, because the relationship between sin and pleasure is inseparable, meaning where there is pleasure, there is sin. Enjoyment is not possible without the destruction of other beings. x" अध्यात्म निर्विचारत्ववैशारखे प्रसीदति । ऋतंभरा ततः प्रज्ञा श्रतानुमितितोऽधिका॥"

## Steadfast Vision: The Essence of Steadfast Vision, Kalash Kavya (511)

Knowing that there is only sin in attachment, the righteous, the Samyakdrishti, desires to be free from the objects of sense. Moreover, the pleasures arising from Dharma often become a source of attachment, because they corrupt the true nature of the self and lead to pride. Just as fire kindled by cool sandalwood can burn, so too, the pleasures derived from Dharma can cause suffering for the discerning soul. Similarly, to desire pleasure from pleasure is like shifting a burden from one shoulder to another. It does not alleviate the burden, but only perpetuates the habit of carrying it. To believe that pleasure can be attained by giving up pleasure is delusion, because it only leads to new habits of desire and the thirst for objects does not cease. Understanding this, the Samyakdrishti strives to stay away from pleasure, that is, to practice Pratyahara, the withdrawal of the senses from objects.

Furthermore, the other signs of non-attachment, such as Alolupata, which are attained through the practice of Yoga, manifest from the fifth stage of vision onwards. (See page 506)

The 112 knots are broken by the brilliance, the mind is steadfast in the knowable and unknowable; the night of ignorance passes, the dawn of knowledge breaks. 113

Just as milk and water are recognized, so too, the self and non-self are differentiated; the yogi, with a pure mind, enjoys the true nature of the self. 114

The world is like a play of dust and dirt, the activities of life seem to be real; like a mirage and dreams, the external world appears to be real to the ignorant. 115

Yoga-drishti-samuchaya
The only true, external, Kevala is one, without obstacles, without defects; that is the ultimate principle here, all else is just a wave. 116 Thus the wise, patient, great one, always practices pratyahara, withdrawing the senses from objects, not clinging to enjoyment. 117 Where the senses have been withdrawn from objects, where they have been forcefully removed from the objects they love, they are united with their own form. 118 Enjoyment is the friend of sin, enjoyment is the disease for yoga; enjoyment is the enjoyment of the serpent, who desires enjoyment forever? 119 Even from dharma, enjoyment is obtained, but it is not liked; like cool sandalwood, it burns the forest of fire. 120 From enjoyment, the cessation of desire, never happens, it only increases; taking the burden off one shoulder, it is loaded onto the other! 121 Thus the yogi thinks, without desire, self-contented, a treasure of virtue; he abandons the poison of objects, and worships the nectar of his own form. 122 The eight great siddhis, the nine treasures, are near to yoga; all powers become his servants, and come to him of their own accord. 123 He sees the nine drishtis, the true Samyak-drishti! Where there is infinite power of the soul, there is only the attainment of siddhi. 124 Sitting in the house of his own form, the yogi is a witness here; he sees the play of the dust of karma, and experiences the waves of lila freely. 125 He removes the bondage of dharma, he strives for dharma through the principle; he remains steadfast in his own dharma, and attains the state of the delight of the Lord. 126 ॥ इति महर्षिश्रीहरिभद्राचार्यविरचिते किरत्चंद्रसूनुमनःसुखनंदनेन भगवानदासेन सुमनोनंदनीबृहत्टीकानामकविवेचनेन सप्रपञ्च विवेचिते श्रीयोगदृष्टिसमुच्चयशाने पञ्चमी स्थिरादृष्टिः॥

## Kanta Dristi

**And in this way, the sixth Dristi is explained. The Jain scriptures say, "What is the nature of the Jantāvatā?" Therefore, there is no other ultimate goal here, only the investigation of the good.** (162)

**In the sixth Kanta Dristi, everything that was just said is present. There is no other goal than the love of the other, and the perception of the other as worthy. This is the only investigation, and it is always beneficial.** (162)

**Meaning:** In the Kanta Dristi, the eternal vision and other things become the cause of love for the other, and there is a perception of the other as worthy. Therefore, there is no other goal here, and there is only the eternal investigation of the good.

**Commentary:** Now, I will speak of the sixth Dristi, which is called Kanta. There, your light shines. The investigation of the truth is firm, and there is no other perception.

**Glory to the teachings of the Jina!** - Shri A.D. Sajay - 5

**Explanation:** In the Kanta Dristi, the eternal vision and other things that were just said do not become the cause of love for the other or hatred. There is a perception of the other as worthy. "The binding of the mind to the country" is the characteristic of this perception. It has been said that "the perception is from the beginning" (Pa. Ru. 1). Because of this perception, in this Dristi, there is no other goal. There is no other joy. This is because of the perception of the other. The eternal, all-time, investigative mind is present. Therefore, it is said that it is beneficial - because of the fruit of right knowledge. 

Page #590:
---------------------------
(514)
This sixth perspective, called "Kantha," is characterized by (1) the constant presence of the qualities mentioned earlier, such as "Nitya Darshan," which inspire love in others, not hatred. (2) It involves a deep-rooted conviction, a firm anchoring of the mind. (3) This conviction eliminates any other desires or attachments, as it renders them irrelevant. (4) It fosters a constant and insightful contemplation of the truth, fueled by the fruits of right knowledge and a compassionate heart.

The name "Kantha" is apt for this perspective. It signifies a devoted wife who is completely dedicated to her husband. Just as a devoted wife, despite performing other household duties, always keeps her husband in her thoughts, similarly, a person with this perspective, even while engaged in worldly affairs, keeps their mind focused on the teachings of Dharma. Alternatively, "Kantha" can also be interpreted as "beloved" or "charming." A person embodying this perspective appears captivating and endearing, just like someone who is universally loved. This also justifies the name "Kantha" for this perspective. Another reason for this name is that this perspective is highly cherished by yogis.

Therefore, this sixth perspective, "Kantha," encompasses all the qualities of the fifth perspective, such as "Nitya Darshan," but with greater purity and intensity. "Nitya Darshan," subtle understanding, withdrawal of senses, and abandonment of delusion are all present here, but with even greater strength.

The vision attained here, like the steady gaze of a star, is constant and unwavering, but even more pure and powerful. It is likened to a star because, just as a star shines brightly and steadily like a precious gem, but with even greater intensity, this perspective illuminates the mind with a similar brilliance. Just as a star shines eternally in the sky, remaining steadfast, similarly, the light of right knowledge illuminates the mind of a person with this perspective, remaining constant and unwavering. This vision, like the star's light, continuously illuminates the inner sky of consciousness. Moreover, just as a star shines independently in the sky, this perspective's understanding also illuminates the mind without any external support. This independence is achieved through the reliance on the Supreme Being, the ultimate knower, who is the source of all knowledge. This reliance on the Supreme Being transforms the challenging ocean of existence into a safe haven, allowing the soul to experience its inherent purity and joy.

Therefore, the understanding of a person with this perspective is extremely subtle. It is like a...

## Kanta Drishti:  

**Verse 515**

A person with Samyak Drishti (right vision) knows the subtle intricacies of Yoga and its profound secrets through the true nature of the soul. Their understanding of scriptures and experiences keeps growing, leading them to realize their pure, innate self. The subtle "Khaad" (deficiency) of self-awareness, which is the ultimate discernment, becomes stronger and more stable. They have a firm conviction that they are the pure, conscious soul, distinct from the body. This conviction is so strong that they firmly believe that the soul is the only reality, encompassing all its inherent qualities, and everything else is merely material. In this eternal play of ignorance, it is only the "Pudgala" (matter) that dances, not anything else. The soul is pure, conscious, and made of the essence of "Chaitanya" (consciousness), distinct from the "Pudgala" and its modifications like attachment, aversion, etc.

This firm conviction in the soul leads them to completely abandon everything that is devoid of "Chaitanya" (consciousness). They fully realize the soul as pure consciousness and transcend the world, experiencing the infinite, true self within themselves.

This subtle understanding eliminates the fatigue caused by "Mithyatva" (false belief) and brings them ultimate peace. The primary delusion is mistaking the non-self for the self, which is "Mithyatva" or ignorance. Recognizing the self as the self is "Samyaktv" or knowledge, which brings peace, rest, cessation, and tranquility. Mistaking the non-self for the self is the greatest attachment for the soul, which leads to endless suffering in the form of mental and existential delusion. A person with Samyak Drishti (right vision) is completely free from this great disease of mistaking the non-self for the self. They find peace in their true nature, become established in their true self, and experience ultimate peace.

Since they have overcome the fundamental delusion of mistaking the non-self for the self, and have found ultimate peace in recognizing the self as the self, these wise individuals with Samyak Drishti (right vision) withdraw the soul from the non-self. They do not engage in the consequences of external actions, nor do they allow the soul to be entangled in the non-self, becoming lost in it. Instead, they engage in the true nature of the soul.

* "The soul is the only reality, encompassing all its inherent qualities, and everything else is merely material. In this eternal play of ignorance, it is only the "Pudgala" (matter) that dances, not anything else. The soul is pure, conscious, and made of the essence of "Chaitanya" (consciousness), distinct from the "Pudgala" and its modifications like attachment, aversion, etc." - Shri Amritchandracharya, Shri Samayasar Kalash.

(516)
Those with right faith (Samyak Darshan) constantly move away from worldly objects, and like a tortoise, they withdraw their senses from objects. Therefore, their flow of karmic afflictions (Asrava) easily ceases, and a state of intense austerity (Samvara) is revealed. As a result, their soul itself becomes the embodiment of austerity (Samvara), becoming hidden in its pure form. Thus, the benefits of the fivefold vision (Panchama Drishti), including eternal vision (Nitya Darshan) and withdrawal (Pratyahara), are particularly strong and pure in this sixth vision (Shasta Drishti). Seeing such supremely generous and virtuous individuals with right faith (Samyak Darshan), others naturally feel love for them. Their popularity stems from the inherent charm of their character, which is a manifestation of their great austerity (Samvara). What is the reason for this immense influence of these great souls? It is because seeing them evokes natural love and respect in others.

The sixth limb of yoga, called "Dharana," is "to serve the Jina (liberated soul), to hold the goal (Moksha) in mind." - Shri Devchandraji. In this vision, the sixth limb of yoga, called "Dharana," is attained, because it naturally follows the attainment of the fifth limb, called "Pratyahara" (withdrawal). Dharana means to confine the mind to a specific limited area or field, to keep it focused and free from distractions. This is the definition of Dharana. The mind, like a monkey, is extremely fickle and restless, constantly wandering in all directions. To stabilize it in the tip of the nose (Nasagra) or to keep it engaged in the continuous ascent and descent of the Shruta Skandha (scriptural knowledge), to bind it with the chain of love to the nail of devotion to the Lord, or to keep it engaged in the practice of pure self-reflection, is Dharana. (See page 212-213) The function of Pratyahara is to withdraw the soul from external influences, and the function of Dharana is to hold it in its own essence. Thus, to divert the mind from objects and engage it only in its own essence, to keep it focused on the true nature of the soul (Atma Swaroop Dharma), is the pure Dharana that a person with right faith (Samyak Darshan) practices, which ultimately leads to complete absorption (Samadhi) filled with bliss (Tattvananda). Such a person with right faith (Samyak Darshan) and excellent self-absorption (Atma Dharana) transcends all external influences (Paraparinaati), refutes all dualities (Bhedavada), and establishes himself in the vast, undivided, and knowledge-filled nature of the soul (Atma Swaroop). After that, where is there any scope for further action (Karma) or karmic bondage (Paudgalik Karma)?

Such a wonderful soul, filled with the essence of the soul (Atma Swaroop Dharma) - (For more details, see) - Shri Samayasar Kalash.

## Kanta Dushtti: Anyamud - "What I don't like, I don't like in others"

(517) The Dharana-possessing, discerning, right-sighted man is extremely alert and awake in his own activities, and deaf, blind, and mute in the activities of others! "Aramkavruttivattina:, Pavruttee Vishayoo: Shri Yashovijayajikrit Adhyatmapanishada."

Anyamud destroys the fault. "Dharma Jinesar Gau Rangshun, Bhang Ma Padshe Ho Preet...Jinesar!"
"Baje Man Mandir Aanun Nahi, Ae Am Kulvat Reet...Ji." Shri Anandghanji.

And here, there is a firm, unwavering Dharana in one's own true nature, which is why the steadfast Yogi, who is established in this vision, does not have Anyamud. Joy does not arise elsewhere, because joy arises nowhere else except in the soul. For, where else would the abode of supreme bliss, the Sachchidananda-form of Bhagwan Anandghan, be found? The one who has tasted the nectar of supreme bliss of the soul, how can he be interested in trivial worldly pleasures like "bakas bukas"? Why would he like anything else besides the soul and the Dharma of the soul? Such a soul-absorbed, right-sighted, wise man finds joy only in his own immersion in the soul. He cannot bear even a moment of separation from that bliss. And even if, unwillingly, he is momentarily distracted from the uninterrupted experience of the ocean of nectar-bliss by external, karmic circumstances, he experiences profound regret for it. - Such is the noble nature of the wise man who is self-realized.

"Manmehan Tum Sanamuk Nirkat, Aankh Na Trupati Amchi; Mahatimir Ravi Harsh Chandra Chhavi, Murat Ae Upshamchi....
Hun Te Vari Prabhu! Tum Mukhni." - Shri Devchandraji. Because the wise, right-sighted man is a supreme devotee of the supreme soul-essence, he has an unparalleled love for it, a flow of supreme love flows through him, so much so that his mind does not even momentarily find pleasure in anything else. He is bound by such an unprecedented love for the pure, innate, self-existent Lord, that he does not like anything else. Just as a bee that has found a Malati flower will not sit on a Babul branch, and a swan that has tasted the pure, cool, fragrant Ganga water will not play in the impure, foul, and painful water of a Dudhi Khachiya, so too, the one who is intensely yearning for the Lord, chanting "Peeu Peeu" (drink, drink), will not be attracted to anything else.

**Gadashtisamuchchay**

Just as a Chatak bird, waiting for the water of the clouds, does not look at any other water, similarly, a wise man's mind does not find any attraction in anything other than the Supreme Soul.

Why would a Chatak bird look at any other water when it is waiting for the water of the clouds? Why would a mango tree, with its cool shade and sweet fruits, be attracted to a tall, barren palm tree? Why would a lotus flower be attracted to anything other than the sun? Why would a moonflower be attracted to anything other than the moon? Why would Gauri (Parvati) desire anyone other than Girish (Shiva), or Lakshmi desire anyone other than Girish (Krishna)? Similarly, why would a wise man's mind find any attraction in anything other than the Supreme Soul? (See page 381-382)

This unwavering love for the Supreme Soul makes the wise man so absorbed and focused that he does not even perceive any other object. The mind of a wise man with Samyagdrishti is so engrossed in its own nature that it is not even aware of what is happening elsewhere. This extraordinary, unique feeling is evident in the spontaneous words of Shrimad Rajchandraji, which are a living example for the discerning and wise. For example:

"Night and day, my mind is only focused on the Supreme Soul. My food is the Supreme Soul, my sleep is the Supreme Soul, my bed is the Supreme Soul, my dreams are the Supreme Soul, my fear is the Supreme Soul, my gathering is the Supreme Soul, my possessions are the Supreme Soul, my movement is the Supreme Soul, my posture is the Supreme Soul. What more can I say? My bones, flesh, and their essence are all the same color. Every hair on my body knows only the Supreme Soul. Therefore, I do not like anything, I do not taste anything, I do not hear anything, I do not smell anything, I do not touch anything, I do not speak, I do not remain silent, I do not sit, I do not stand, I do not sleep, I do not wake up, I do not eat, I do not feel hungry, I do not like being alone, I do not like being with others, I do not like being happy, I do not like being sad. It is like this." (See Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 120, 133)

This is just a glimpse into the state of a wise man with Samyagdrishti, who has attained this unique feeling. In this sixth stage of perception, the sixth mental defect called Anyamud is destroyed. Anyamud is the tendency to find pleasure in things other than the Supreme Soul, or to be attracted to other things while neglecting the Supreme Soul. It is like a shower of embers on the path of the Supreme Soul. (See page 86)

In this sixth stage of perception, the sixth virtue called Mimamsa is manifested. After the manifestation of the virtue called Sukshmad in the fifth stage of perception, the virtue of Mimamsa naturally arises.

## Kanta Drishti: Hiteodayavati Mimamsa

(519) Because one who generates subtle understanding, then contemplates the two-fold nature of existence, engages in deep introspection, constantly ponders and meditates, and continuously engages in philosophical contemplation. Just as when someone eats a delicious meal, they chew it thoroughly, leading to proper production of digestive juices in the stomach, resulting in excellent digestion, and then those juices, becoming one with the essence, nourish all the limbs, making them strong and robust; similarly, when the right kind of food for the soul is chewed thoroughly, meaning contemplated repeatedly, it leads to the production of excellent emotions, and the pure self-realization, the excellent digestion, takes place. Then, this realized essence spreads throughout the body and mind, nourishing it with the strength of pure soul-qualities, making it strong and robust. This analogy explains the ultimate purpose of contemplation.

Therefore, the wise, the one with the right vision, contemplates the subtle aspects of substance, qualities, modes, their destruction, viewpoints, proofs, true nature, the three-fold nature of creation, destruction, and permanence, the seven-fold categorization, the soul, karma, and momentum, etc. They contemplate deeply, understanding that the soul exists in relation to its own substance, space, time, and state, and does not exist in relation to other substances, space, time, and state. Through this deep contemplation, they delve into the ultimate mystery of the union of substance, the ultimate essence of the soul, the essence of the Lord, meaning the inherent nature of the pure soul, and they make it their own nature.

“Qualities and modes are infinite, and so is the inherent nature. Viewpoints, destruction, and classifications are like the flow of a river...O Kunthu! The self exists in its own nature, and does not exist in the nature of others. Existence is non-existence, and the self exists in both natures...Kunthu.” - Shri Devchandraji.

This kind of subtle contemplation and philosophical inquiry is beneficial, leading to the attainment of all kinds of self-welfare. Uday means the rising phase. Just as the sun rises and gradually increases its brilliance, reaching its full glory at noon, similarly, here too, the sun of self-interest rises, gradually reaching a higher state of self-awareness, and ultimately attaining the full glory of the self at noon. Or, just as the moon gradually reaches its full phase at the full moon, similarly, here too, the moon of self-interest gradually reaches its full phase, attaining the fullness of the pure, inherent, natural state. Just as the lotus bud gradually unfolds, reaching its full bloom, similarly, here too, the lotus of self-interest, with its thousand petals, gradually unfolds, reaching its full bloom. The nine treasures and the eight great attainments, etc., follow the wise person like a shadow, but the liberated, detached wise person does not even look back at them.

“There is nothing greater than the Self. There is no influence, nor will there be any influence, in this creation, which is not attained by the complete Self; yet, the Self does not say anything about that influence, that is how it is. And if it appears that the Self says something about that influence, then know that it is due to the extreme ignorance of the Self.”

## Kanta Dristi: Dharma is the nature of the self, karma is the opposite.

(521) The glory of Dharma is unparalleled. It is essential to understand the true nature of Dharma. Here, "Dharma" refers to the eternal, everlasting Atmadharma (Dharma of the soul). Jain Dharma is its synonym, because the pure soul, having attained its inherent pure form, is called "Jin," meaning the liberated Lord; and that Jin, the pure soul, is Dharma itself, which is Jain Dharma. Everything else is karma. Karma is what cuts and binds the soul, and Jinavachan (the teachings of the Jinas) is what cuts it. This is the essence of the knowledge of the wise. This Atmadharma is inherent in the soul, eternal, everlasting, and unaffected by time. To remain in this state of the soul, to hold onto the soul, is called "Dharma"; and that is the true Dharma. Because knowledge, perception, and conduct are the inherent qualities of the soul, or the pure, single, all-pervading, knowing consciousness that is the nature of the soul, to live in it, to remain in it, to hold onto the soul, is Dharma of the soul. "The nature of the object is Dharma. The nature of the soul is Atmadharma." Thus, to live in the pure state of knowledge and perception of the soul is Dharma. But the world is unaware of this true nature of Dharma. Everyone in the world goes around saying "Dharma, Dharma," but they don't know the essence of Dharma. They don't know that after taking refuge in the feet of the Jineshwar, one will not create any karma. This is what the great soul Anandghanji sang in the Mahagita.

People go around searching for Dharma in other people's homes, but they don't see that Dharma is in their own father's home! They behave like the musk deer! The musk deer has musk in its navel, but it doesn't know where the fragrance comes from. So, it wanders around searching for it! Similarly, this Dharma resides within one's own soul, it hasn't gone anywhere else, yet people, in their ignorance, search for it outside, hoping to find it, and they become frustrated and disappointed. They ignore the supreme treasure that is right in front of their own eyes, and they go out searching for it, only to be defeated! (See page 480). "You go around searching for Dharma, but you don't find it in your own home. Just like the musk deer doesn't know about the musk, it doesn't know the essence of the fragrance."

"Shri Simandhar Saheb listens." - Shri Yashovijayji, S. Ga, St.

Thus, this Dharma resides within one's own soul, or the soul itself...

(222)
The essence of Yoga-Dristi is Dharma, a simple truth that many fail to understand. Just as purity is the inherent nature of a crystal, and thus its Dharma, similarly, the absence of passions (Kashaya) - purity - is the inherent nature of the soul, and thus its Dharma. In other words, pure soul, free from attachments, is Dharma. Purity of the soul is Dharma. The opposite of this is Adharma. However, even though a crystal is inherently pure, if a red flower is placed near it, a red hue is reflected in it. Similarly, if a black flower is placed near it, a black hue is reflected. Thus, due to external influences, the purity of the crystal is covered by a layer of impurities. Similarly, due to external influences in the form of Karma, the purity of the soul is obscured by the arising of passions like attachment, aversion, pride, etc. When these influences are removed, the crystal shines in its inherent pure form. Similarly, when passions are removed, the soul shines in its inherent pure form. The soul's inherent nature is pure and unblemished by the three periods of time (past, present, future). It is self-existent. When the covering is removed, it simply manifests. Thus, to the extent that the covering is removed, the influences of passions are overcome, and freedom from attachments is achieved, to that extent the attainment of Dharma of the soul is achieved. This freedom from attachments, starting from the state of Right Faith (Samyak-Dristi), gradually manifests until the attainment of liberation (Moksha).

Just as purity is the nature of the crystal, so is the nature of the soul. The Jinas have illuminated this Dharma, the powerful absence of passions... Shri Simandhar. Just as a flower reflects the color of its surroundings, so does the soul reflect the influence of good and bad deeds. Passions lead to... Shri Simandhar. We cannot call it Dharma if it is influenced by passions. This was first explained by the Jinas, that Karma creates influences. Shri Simandhar. To the extent that one is free from attachments, one knows Dharma. From the state of Right Faith, one can say... Shri Simandhar.

As the influence of external factors fades and the influence of the soul shines, this pure Dharma of the soul unfolds and expands, until in liberation, the soul becomes the embodiment of pure Dharma. The complete liberation of the soul attains liberation, which is the culmination of Karma. The essence is that the attainment of the pure soul is its inherent nature, and that is Dharma. As the influence of Karma fades, Dharma-Samadhi manifests, because the influence of passions is Karma, and the state of Samadhi, which is the manifestation of the soul's nature, is Dharma. This is the clear definition of Dharma. The essence of Dharma...

## Kanta Dristi: The Unparalleled Glory of Dharma, Purity of Right Conduct

(523) Dharma, along with other factors, contributes to the birth and attainment of this inherent Dharma, this Atma Dharma, to the extent that it is a cause. Without the attainment of this inherent Dharma, there is failure. As the great sage Shri Devchandraji has said, "Without Bhava, everything is futile."

This Atma Nirmata (self-purification) form of inherent Dharma has become extremely manifest in this Dristi (perspective), because those who possess this Dristi, the Samyag Dristi Gipurusha (perfect visioned soul), are deeply rooted in their own being, they abandon external influences and embrace their true nature. They are such great souls, embodiments of Dharma.

"Dhammo Mangalamukkitum, Ahimsa Sanjamo Tavo. Seva Vi THsaati, Nar Gha Cha Malo" - Shri Dasha Vaikalik Sutra.

The glory of this inherent Dharma is unparalleled. The glory of Chintamani, Kamakumbha, Kalpavriksha, etc., is insignificant compared to it. When this Dharma manifests in its true form within the soul, all attainments, all accomplishments, all divine powers become its humble servants, standing before it. Yet, this self-absorbed, liberated, glorious soul does not even care about them! It does not even bother to look at them! Truly, even gods bow down to such great souls whose minds are always immersed in Dharma. Because Ahimsa, Samyama, and Tapa are the aspects of Dharma, and these great souls have attained their highest perfection. They do not allow any violence to their true nature through external influences, and they remain constantly in their own being, therefore they are extremely non-violent. They keep their soul restrained in its true form, they do not allow it to wander outside, therefore they are completely restrained. Thus, through non-violence, which is not going outside, and through restraint, which is staying in one's own nature, the powerful Atma Virya (spiritual strength) accumulates, and therefore these Gipurusha (perfect visioned souls) shine with the supreme brilliance of their true nature, they are the epitome of Tapas (austerity). What wonder is there that even gods bow down to such non-violent, restrained, and austere true saints?

The glory of the attainment of pure Dharma, which is a combination of Yogadristi and Samyak Achar Vishuddhi, results in Samyak Achar Vishuddhi, meaning the complete purification of Jnanaachar, Darshanachar, Charitraachar, Tapaachar, and Viryaachar. Therefore, (1) "With Jnanaacharan, this Yogi Purusha observes the time of Swadhyaya, practices various types of Vinaya, respectfully performs the Udhyana Vidhi with utmost care, honors with great respect, completely eliminates Deshapatti, and remains extremely cautious in the purity of Artha-Vyanjana and both." (2) With Darshanacharan, they are immersed in Prashamrasana, filled with firm Sanvega, possess supreme Vairagya, are devoted to Anukampa, and are Astikya. They are always prepared to suppress doubts, desires, doubts, and foolishness as they arise, by constantly tying the Badhparikar-Bheth. They repeatedly enhance their enthusiasm by nurturing Upvrunhan, Sthitikaran, Vatsalya, and Prabhavna. (3) With Charitraacharan, they are dedicated to the five great vows, which are completely renunciatory in nature, including violence, falsehood, theft, adultery, and attachment. They are extremely diligent in the secrecy of Samyam, which is characterized by Yognigraha. They are extremely diligent in the Samitis of jealousy, speech, greed, acquisition and disposal, and renunciation. (4) With Tapaacharan, they are enthusiastic every moment in Anashan, Amdarya, Vrittiparisankhyan, Rasparityag, and secluded bed and seat. They control their inner mind through Prayashchitta, Vinaya, Vaiyavrutya, Vyutsarga, Swadhyaya, and Dhyanparikar. (5) For the sake of Viryaacharan, they are fully engaged in Karmakanda with all their might." Thus, they perfectly observe the Panchaachar without any transgression. This is their Niratichar Bhava Anushthan, active conduct.
"These practices are for the ultimate welfare of Samyagdristi Jivas who are on the path. Therefore, they must practice them, they must strive diligently to practice them. Through study, pure conduct will be achieved. Oh! What incomparable conduct!" (To understand the heart-felt, clear form of this Panchaachar in detail, see) - Shri Mansukh Bhai Kirchandt
Danadharmapanchaachar, the good action that follows knowledge - the name of that is "Anushthan", meaning this Samyagdristi Purusha, who has attained self-knowledge, constantly strives with utmost effort to perform the self-conduct that is appropriate to that self-knowledge - to maintain good character. This true Sadhu Purusha has excellent feelings of Vandanadi Anushthan.

**The Khata Dristi:** Ideal conduct, mind focused on Dharma

(525) This is why the conduct and character of the Paramatma Yogi with this Dristi is free from all blemishes, following pure usage, endowed with special diligence, focused on proper use, and with a serious and generous intention. (See page 72, and page 25, Shrimad Rajchandraji's "A Unique Poem for a Unique Occasion.")

He is free from: Ismita (ego), Bhasha-samita (attachment to language), Eshana-samita (attachment to desires), Adan-bhandamaatra-nikshepan-samita (attachment to accumulation), Parikaapanika-samita (attachment to external objects), Manas-samita (attachment to mind), Vachan-samita (attachment to speech), Kaya-samita (attachment to body), Man-guptha (secrecy of mind), Vachan-guptha (secrecy of speech), Kaya-guptha (secrecy of body), Guptha (secrecy), Gukhendriya (secrecy of senses), Guptha Brahmachari (secret celibacy), Akodha (angerlessness), Amana (pridelessness), Amaya (attachmentlessness), Abha (fearlessness), Shanta (calm), Prasanta (tranquil), Upshanta (serene), Parinivruta (detached), Anashrava (free from karmic inflow), Agradha (free from attachment), Chinnashrota (broken karmic stream), Nipalepa (free from defilement), Kashyapaatra (like a vessel of pure water), Shankha (like a conch, pure and clear), Jeeva (like a soul, free and unhindered), Gaganatal (like the sky, without support), Vayu (like the wind, without obstruction), Sharadjal (like autumn water, pure and clear), Pushkarpatra (like a lotus leaf, free from blemishes), Koorm (like a tortoise, with hidden senses), Vihag (like a bird, free from bondage), Gaenda-na-shingada (like a rhinoceros horn, single-minded), Bharand-pakshi (like a crane, diligent), Kunjar (like an elephant, strong and powerful), Vrushabha (like a bull, steady and stable), Simha (like a lion, fearless and powerful), Mandar (like Mount Meru, unshakable), Sagar (like the ocean, deep and vast), Chandra (like the moon, gentle and luminous), Surya (like the sun, radiant and bright), Jaatya-suvarna (like pure gold, pure and unblemished), Vasundhara (like the earth, all-embracing and tolerant), Suhuta-hutaashan (like a well-lit fire, burning with brilliance).

He is not bound by any restrictions.

And due to this perfect purity of conduct, this pure-footed Nigrantha Shraman naturally becomes dear to the people. He doesn't need to speak or make any artificial effort to gain this spontaneous affection. It is the pure character of the Nigrantha Mahatma, naturally attained, that attracts people like a beacon! Hundreds of words cannot convey the wisdom that a silent Muni embodies. Thousands of teachings and millions of interpretations cannot match the silent power of a true sage. The pure, natural, and unblemished character of a true sage speaks volumes! And thus, a natural flow of love arises towards him.

**Mind focused on Dharma:**

And such a pure-conduct, Dharma-embodied, avatar of ultimate truth, the Samyagudristi Yogi, his mind is always focused on Dharma, what is there to ask? Dharma is...

(See Shri Sutra Kritanga, Kin. Shru. Run. Sutra 70 for this beautiful description of the heart of Nigrantha Charya) 

Page #602:
---------------------------
(26)
The collection of perceptions is the very essence of their life, it becomes their life itself, such is the unwavering faith in Dharma that permeates them from their bones to their marrow. Here is a shining example of such a Dharma-embodied Yogi:
“He whose bones are Dharma, whose marrow is Dharma, whose blood is Dharma, whose flesh is Dharma, whose skin is Dharma, whose senses are Dharma. He whose movement is Dharma, whose sitting is Dharma, whose standing is Dharma, whose sleep is Dharma, whose awakening is Dharma, whose food is Dharma, whose enjoyment is Dharma, whose contemplation is Dharma, whose choice is Dharma, whose resolve is Dharma, whose everything is Dharma, such a man is rare to find. And he is the Supreme Soul in a human body. Do we not desire such a state?” - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 117. (130)
Thus, this Yogi is supremely steadfast in his adherence to Dharma, the fruit of his long-standing austerities. For, as we saw in the previous perspective in the process of spiritual development, he first cultivated his inner practice through the feelings of Maitri, Karuna, Mudita, and Upeksha, thereby purifying his mind; then he diligently studied Yama and Niyama; he conquered Asana, abandoning the focus on the body and establishing himself in the feeling of the Self; he avoided Pranaviksep, maintaining the stability of the feeling of the Self through Pranayama; he practiced Pratyahara, withdrawing the senses from their objects, and balancing and straightening the body; he conquered the tendencies of attachment and aversion, pleasure and pain, and deeply immersed himself in the practice of Samprajnat Samadhi; and he confined his mind to the region of the navel chakra, the tip of the nose, etc., by avoiding distractions, that is, by abandoning all other objects and establishing the mind in its steadiness. How could such a Yogi, established in this steadiness, well-ordered and perfectly balanced, not be dear to the world? And how could he not be devoted to Dharma? He himself says:
“The mind is always in Dharma, the body is engaged in other activities. Therefore, due to the knowledge of the right action, there are no causes for worldly existence.” (Shruti Dharma, 164)
(See reference) Shri Dva. Dva. 24-9.
“The mind is bound to the region, its steadiness is there. He is dear to all beings, and he is devoted to Dharma.”

## Kanta Dristi: In Brief - "Is the woman's mind on her beloved?"

(527) The mind is always in the Shruta Dharma, the body in other activities;
Therefore, due to the Akshepak Jnana, they do not become Bhavahetu. 164 Meaning - Her mind is always in the Shruta Dharma, her body in other activities; therefore, due to the Akshepak Jnana, she does not become Bhavahetu.

| **Analysis** - The mind of the Bhagi with this presented Dristi is in the Shruta Dharma, in the Agama, due to the firm belief in the Shruta Dharma, and her body is in other ordinary activities. This is the reason why, due to the Akshepak Jnana, the Bhagi does not become Bhavahetu - the cause of Samsara.

In this Dristi, the Samyak Dristi Yogi Purusha develops such a firm belief in Atma Dharma that his mind remains constantly immersed in the Shruta Dharma - the Agama - which he has heard from the Shrimad Satpurusha Sadguru Bhagwan. Even though his body may be engaged in other ordinary activities related to worldly Akshepak Jnana, his mind is still focused on the Shruta Dharma. He has such an extraordinary attraction - Akshepan - to this Dharma that it draws his mind to itself, no matter what he is doing. Just as a magnet attracts iron, so too does this innate Akshepak Jnana, which attracts and holds the mind towards the Shruta Dharma. This innate knowledge is called Akshepak Jnana. And the Gyanee Purusha who possesses this innate knowledge is called "Jnana Akshepakvant."

Here, a well-known example arises. The mind of a woman, that is, a Pativrata woman, is always focused on her beloved, even while performing other household tasks. Similarly, the mind of a Jnana Akshepakvant Gyanee Purusha is constantly immersed in the Shruta Dharma, even while performing other worldly activities or enjoying pleasures. The mind of this Maha Mumukhu is in the state of "Meksha" and "Kheliyu Samsara."

Shrimad Rajchandraji has beautifully explained this in his Prakash: "The woman's mind is on her beloved, while she performs other tasks; similarly, the mind of the Jnana Akshepakvant is firmly rooted in the Shruta Dharma... Dhan." - Shri Yo, Da, Sakzaya 6-6

Upon subtle analysis of this verse, the profound Tatvavetaa Shrimad Rajchandraji has given a very insightful analysis: "Just as the mind of a Pativrata (the word "Mahila" means woman) woman is focused on her beloved husband, even while performing all other household tasks, so too is the mind of a Samyak Dristi Jeeva focused on the Shruta Dharma, even while performing all worldly activities and tasks, because he has heard the teachings of the Gyanee." 

Page #604:
---------------------------
(28)
The collection of yogic perspectives is presented. In the entire world, the love between men and women is considered primary. Among them, the love of a woman for a man is considered even more primary. And among that, the love of a devoted wife for her husband is considered primary even within the primary. Why is this love considered primary within the primary? The one who has strongly presented the principle, the proponent of the principle, says that we consider this love primary within the primary because even while doing all other household (and other) tasks, the mind of that devoted woman remains absorbed in her husband, with love, remembrance, attention, and desire. But the proponent of the principle says that the cause of this love is worldly, and here we are talking about making it non-worldly, therefore this love is absorbed, loving, remembering, attentive, and desiring.
Where it is appropriate, where this love attains non-worldly results, we say that. This love, the same way that a seeker who is devoted to their husband, should act towards the teachings, etc., of the knowledgeable one, which are in the form of listening; and the way that the being acts towards them, then we know that the being is situated in the perspective of "kanta," which is related to the same kind of love.
There are two such words that are complete in this sense. Those words are the primary of devotion. x x x By acting in the state of the primary of devotion, the defects of the being, such as attachment, etc., easily dissolve, this is the primary intention of the knowledgeable person. Even a small amount of selfless devotion that arises in a being, even that is suitable for removing defects. Such knowledge or the state of the primary of knowledge is attained towards the non-suitable meaning, towards the defects of attachment, etc., or towards the change related to the object. This happens a lot. Even in this time, it is considered appropriate to worship the state of the primary of devotion for a long time, even for a lifetime, this is the decision that the knowledgeable ones have made. (We think so, and it is so.) – Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter 320 (394)
Furthermore, "Even if the mind holds firm, the one who has attained knowledge," on this word, they, Shrimad Rajchandraji, shed light, doing a further, extremely profound, and insightful analysis:
The one who has attained knowledge without distraction, the one who is a seeker of self-welfare, the one who has heard from the mouth of the knowledgeable one, the one who holds firm in their mind the self-welfare-like dharma, this is the word for the above states. In order to establish this principle in the results of the being, the author knows that a suitable example is needed, so in the world, in the world, the love that a woman has for a man, which is free from the feelings of attachment, etc., is the primary love...

##  Kanta Drishti: The Knower Does Not Become "Bhaga"

(Page 19)

It is said that one should be fully immersed in the Dharma heard from a Satpurush. The Dharma heard from a Satpurush, in which one has love for all other objects, is said to be abandoned by becoming indifferent, with one-pointedness, one-mindedness, one-rhythm, one-remembrance, one-series, one-use, and one-result. The desirable love that remains in the mind is eliminated, and the teachings of making it into Shruta Dharma are given. One should love the Shruta, which is infinitely superior to desirable love. However, an example cannot be limited, so love is said to be limited to the extent of the example, but the principle is not limited. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patraank 321 (395)

Another well-known example is also relevant here. Just as a cow goes to graze in the forest, roaming in all four directions, but its mind remains on its beloved calf, similarly, four or five friends go to fetch water, carrying the water pot on their heads, walking briskly, talking, clapping, and laughing loudly, but their eyes are on their "Gaguria" - their water pot. In the same way, the mind of a knowledgeable knower, free from the distractions of external influences, is always absorbed in Shruta Dharma, even while performing other worldly tasks.

"Jin Charne Chitt Lav, Vaise Jin Charne Chitt Lav,
Chara Charnake Karane Re, Gau
Anmen Jay;
Chara Chere Fire Chihun Dish, Vanki Nazar Madhuria Mah.....Vaise Jin...Chara Panch Sahelimi Mili, Hilmil Pani Jay;
Taali Dvie Khadkhad Hase, Vanki Nazar Gazuria Mahyu....Vaise" - Shri Anandghanji.

"Nishdin Sutant Jagtan, Huida Thi Na Rehe Dur Re;
Jab Upgar Sabhariye, Tav Upje Anandpur Re." - Shri Yashovijayji.

And due to the influence of this natural, inherent, and perceptive knowledge, this knower, a man of Samyagdrishti, does not become "Bhaga" - does not become a cause of Samsara! The worldly "Bhaga" that is the cause of Samsara for other ordinary, natural people, even that "Bhaga" does not become a cause of Samsara for this knower with this vision. This is an extremely surprising but ultimately true event. The explanation is this: ordinary worldly ignorant beings are attracted to the objects of the senses, and this knower is constantly attracted to Shruta Dharma. The ignorant being is always attached to the objects of the senses, indulging in sensual desires and longing for them. And the knower, as seen above, is always absorbed in Shruta Dharma.

8 "Bhoga Nahi Bhavet" 

Page #606:
---------------------------
(530)
The yogic perspective, the right understanding of Dharma, desires only Dharma, not the objects of desire. It distances itself from them, yet when forced to encounter them due to past karma, it experiences them with detachment and indifference, consuming them without attachment. When the ignorant being experiences them with extreme attachment, it becomes bound again. Thus, the difference between the wise and the ignorant, in their attitude and perspective, is like the difference between heaven and earth. Therefore, the ignorant, constantly desiring objects, becomes bound even though it does not experience them. And the wise, not desiring objects, even though it experiences them, does not become bound! This is a truly astonishing phenomenon. (See pp. 502-504).

Because just as puppets dance due to the strings, so too, the activities of the wise, who do not desire, are driven by the strings of past karma. Therefore, even if they engage in worldly activities like enjoyment, according to the arising of past karma, their minds, like a lotus in water, remain detached and absorbed in their true nature. The wise, residing in the world, appear as if they are manifesting the illusion of enjoyment! And there is no fault in this, even for the purpose of compassion. Thus, the wise yogi, even though they may occasionally, as an exception, reside in the world, in homes, etc., and even though they may experience worldly enjoyment, they do not become bound. And the ignorant, even though they do not experience enjoyment, become bound! This extraordinary fact reveals the profound impact of right knowledge.

The reason why the wise do not become bound even though they experience enjoyment is because they lack attachment and affection. Just as a person who is covered in oil, due to affection, will collect dust while exercising in a dusty gymnasium, but a person who is not covered in oil, due to the absence of oil-like stickiness, will not collect dust; similarly, the ignorant, due to the stickiness of affection, attachment, and passion, collect karmic particles like dust. But the wise, who are devoid of affection, passion, and attachment, like a "strong" person, cannot be bound by karmic particles due to the absence of oil-like stickiness of affection and attachment. Thus, the wise, who are capable, are different. They possess the extraordinary ability to remain detached, like a lotus in water. The foolish ignorant cannot imitate them, and if they try, they will only suffer! "The sharpness of the sword, the feet of the fourteenth Tirthankara; the juggler dances on the edge, but do not let him stay on the edge of the sword." - Shri Anandghanji.

This great feat of remaining completely detached while residing in the world can only be achieved by rare, exceptional, extraordinary wise beings. Walking on such a double-edged sword is a task that is "only for those who are wise in all things, not for the weak!" (See) Shri Samayasar - Ga. 242-246.

##  Khata Drishti: The Gnostic's Mirage-Like Perception of the Supreme Abode

(31) This is something that only a capable Yogi can achieve. Even while remaining amidst external influences, maintaining an unbroken state of self-absorption, like the unwavering blade of a sword, is not an easy task. 

But, "It is as difficult as picking up sand from near the eye" - this is what the great Yogi, Shrimad Rajchandraji, who was deeply immersed in the ultimate spiritual essence, truly said. His Vachanamrut is filled with the wonders of this insightful knowledge, which is evident at every step. Even though external influences were present, the self-absorption of this great Gnostic was unbroken, his pure self-awareness was unparalleled, and his detachment even amidst worldly attachments was remarkable. This is evident to the impartial, discerning, and wise person in his Vachanamrut, which is filled with his own experiences. The saying from Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, "Patro di vigyan," also testifies to this state of insightful knowledge.

This same meaning is conveyed through the following analogy:

"Mayaambhastavatah pashyannaanudvignastato druttam | Tanmadhyena prayaty eva yatha vyaghatavarjitah ||165||"

Seeing the mirage as it is, without any anxiety;
He goes through it swiftly, without any hindrance, just like that. (165)

Meaning: The person who sees the mirage as it truly is, does not get anxious about it. He goes through it swiftly, without any hindrance.

Explanation: The one who sees the mirage as it truly is, does not get anxious or scared. Therefore, he goes through it swiftly. And while doing so, he does not face any obstacles, because the mirage, being just water, is incapable of causing any harm. Knowing the mirage for what it is, he understands that it is not real water. The mirage, in its true essence, does not exist, it is just an illusion. The one who knows this, does not get anxious or disturbed. 

He sees the mirage as it truly is, without any anxiety. He goes through it swiftly, without any hindrance, just like that.

(532)
The one who has attained the yogic vision is not afraid of being submerged in the ocean of Maya. Therefore, he fearlessly walks through the net of Maya, without being caught in its clutches. He boldly transgresses it, and in doing so, he encounters no obstacles or hindrances, no difficulties or impediments.
"Knowing it to be the water of Maya, he crosses it unperturbed; knowing the truth, he remains unaffected, not being swayed by the waves of desire."
Shri J. 6. Sajay - 8
"Seeing the objects of enjoyment as they truly are, like the water of Maya, even while enjoying them, he, being unattached, reaches the ultimate goal." 166.
Meaning - The one who sees the objects of enjoyment as illusory, like the water of Maya, even while enjoying them, being unattached, reaches the ultimate goal.
Commentary - In the same way, the one who sees the objects of enjoyment as illusory, like the water of Maya, without identifying with them, even while enjoying them, being unattached, reaches the ultimate goal. This is because he is free from attachment and aversion, and is not controlled by his desires.
Enjoyment refers to the objects of desire, which are illusory, like the water of Maya. The water of Maya is merely an illusion, it has no real existence. Therefore, the one who identifies with the water of Maya is deluded. He is deluded in his desire to attain it, and he is deluded in his belief that it can quench his thirst. Because it is illusory, he can cross it without being submerged. In the same way, the objects of enjoyment are illusory, they are empty. They are nothing compared to the true nature of the self. Therefore, the one who sees them as they truly are, is not attached to them.
Vritti - The one who sees the objects of enjoyment as they truly are, without identifying with them, sees them as illusory, like the water of Maya. Even while enjoying them, he is unattached, and reaches the ultimate goal. This is because he is free from attachment and aversion, and is not controlled by his desires.

## The Vision of the Knower: Detachment and Trikala Viragya

(533) The knower has nothing to do with anything. Therefore, to consider the self in the worthless, illusory objects of enjoyment is wrong. To run after them with the desire for their attainment is also wrong, because what is not one's own can never be obtained, and one can never be satisfied by it. And since it is completely worthless and illusory, the knower, without identifying with it, remains detached, and even when passing through it, does not get immersed in it. Therefore, the knower, who understands the illusory nature of these objects, like a mirage, does not get immersed in them. Even if the karmic fruits of enjoyment come upon him, he passes through them effortlessly and without attachment.

Here, although enjoyment is called "illusory," it does not mean that it has no existence. The word "illusory" here means that although it exists, it is ultimately worthless. Just as there is no water in a mirage, and running after it yields nothing, similarly, there is no self in the objects of enjoyment, and running after them does not benefit the self. Or, "illusory" means not non-existent, but false. Because, in relation to the self, the objects of enjoyment are false, i.e., they are not the self. The self has nothing to do with these objects, yet the ignorant self, identifying with them, gets entangled and bound by the desires and aversions arising from them. But the liberated knower, who is free from desires, does not identify with them, and does not get entangled or bound by them.

The implication here is that the knower, who understands the illusory and worthless nature of these objects, like a mirage, even when experiencing the fruits of past karma, remains detached and attains the ultimate state. The true knower never gets entangled in the mire of enjoyment, like a lotus in water, remaining untouched and completely indifferent. This is called "anasakti yoga" in the Gita.

"Abandoning the mire of enjoyment, he sits above, like a lotus in water; like a lion, he is fearless in his own mind, the support of all the three worlds. Blessed is the sage who walks with equanimity." - Sa, Tr, Ga, St.

The reason why the knower can maintain this detached and non-attached attitude is that he knows with certainty and constantly remembers that these objects are not the self.

(534)
Even an atom in the universe is not mine. I am a pure, knowledge-filled, conscious, formless soul. I have nothing to do with this entire universe. In the past, I was bound by karma due to my attachment to this universe. Now, this karma is coming to collect its due. Let it take its due and quickly free me from debt! After all, "I am not the universe, and the universe is not me. It is not mine, and I am not its." I am I, and it is it. What is mine is mine, and what is its is its. O conscious one! What is mine is with me, everything else is different. So why do you keep saying "mine, mine" in this universe? Why do you keep saying "mine, mine"? Break the attachment of "mine" and "mine." Be certain that "mine" is mine.

Due to this supreme detached attitude and the great influence of the unbroken soul-consciousness, even though the enlightened person is surrounded by the universe, they are not attached to enjoyment. They remain unattached even in the midst of enjoyment, like a black beetle on a black cloth, they experience the karma of enjoyment without being stained. They are freed from the three times (past, present, and future) but are not bound. This is a supreme wonder. This is the supreme secret of the enjoyment of the karma of enjoyment by the enlightened Tirthankara. Even though the Tirthankara, who is detached from the world for countless births, is sometimes forced by past karma to live in a household, they are a firm, knowledge-filled, supreme soul-knower, and even though they experience the karma of enjoyment, they are not bound. Instead, they experience the karma of enjoyment and are freed from it, they destroy it. This is a well-known fact. (See, p. 273-274)

In the same way, some exceptional, powerful enlightened beings, due to the force of past karma, are sometimes forced to live in the world, even though they are truly unwilling from the depths of their hearts. These supreme, powerful yogis, with their supreme self-awareness, remain unattached even in the midst of the world, and they make a supreme effort to transcend it effortlessly. Like the "charan seva" of the fourteenth Jin, who walks on the sharp edge of a sword, they maintain their supreme self-absorption even though they are surrounded by worldly attachments. They demonstrate the amazing feat of walking on the sharp edge of the pure soul-consciousness, showing the supreme, amazing power of the self that they have cultivated, and they inspire joy and wonder. But these exceptional beings are rare, because it is difficult, though not impossible, to maintain self-absorption in the state of renunciation. 
x“अहमेदं एदमहं अहमेदरसेव होमि मम एदम् । अण्णं जं परदव्वं सञ्चित्ताचित्तमिस्सं वा ॥ एयत्तु असंभूदं आदवियप्पं करेदि संमूढो । भूदत्थं जाणंतो ण करेदि दु तं असंमूढो ।
Shri Samayasar Ga. 20-22, (For the amazing meaning of this, see the commentary of Shri Amritchandracharya)

##  Kant Drishti: Such Knowledgeable Ones Are Exceptional - Others Cannot Follow.

(535) It is commendable, but to maintain such self-absorption in the householder stage is extremely difficult, indeed, it is a daunting task. It is easy to avoid stains in a clean room, but to remain spotless even while living in a charcoal room requires a unique level of effort and skill. However, it must be reiterated that such exceptional, supreme yogis are rare. A shining example of this can be found in the life story of the supremely accomplished Shrimad Rajchandraji. Despite being forced into worldly responsibilities by past karmic influences, he maintained an unwavering state of self-absorption. This is evident to any impartial and discerning observer who delves into his Vachanamrut. Similar examples are well-known in other philosophies, such as Janak Videhi and Shri Krishna.

But this act of walking on a double-edged sword, this supreme feat, can only be accomplished by those who are masters of their craft, those who possess extraordinary abilities. Ordinary people, those of average caliber, or those who are just beginning their spiritual journey, should not dare to blindly imitate such individuals. For they are destined to fall, as they lack the capacity and capability. Therefore, when ordinary people attempt to remain detached while living in the world, they are often destined to fail. Not only that, but they are also likely to face great harm. Nowadays, many people can be seen who, driven by their own whims and fancies, read spiritual scriptures and speak of detachment without actually experiencing it, and they deceive others. But if these individuals were to reflect honestly, shedding their pretense and deception, they would realize the folly of their ways. For only those who have attained the sixth stage of vision, those who are mature and knowledgeable, are capable of performing such actions. How can someone who is still in their early stages, lacking the necessary qualifications, achieve what a learned scholar with a doctorate can? Just as a child cannot walk in the shoes of a grown man, so too, ordinary humans cannot imitate the conduct of great sages. And to attempt to do so without the necessary qualifications will only lead to harm. As Shri Narsinh Mehta said:

"Those who merely sing our songs will only eat a lot of leftovers;
Those who understand and sing will reach the heavenly abode of Vaikuntha."

Therefore, only a rare few can traverse the narrow path, the one-step path, while the royal roads... 

Page #612:
---------------------------
(536)
Knowing that the path of Gadashti Samuchaya is accessible to all, let the arduous task of walking on the one-footed path, which is like a leg but remains unattached, be left to the special knowledgeable ones. Let others focus their attention on walking the path of Vidya Tyaga, which is the royal path. This is the essence here. (See, Adhyatma Saar).

Therefore, without experiencing the true self-state like the father, by reading the spiritual words of the knowledgeable man, and imagining oneself to be in such a state, those ignorant people who pretend to be selfless while enjoying worldly pleasures, are actually deceiving themselves and making a mockery of yoga and spirituality. Because external causes of selfishness do not allow them to remain selfless, and not only that, but they also cause their downfall. Therefore, if one truly wants to be selfless, then it is absolutely essential to renounce such external causes. Those who remain unattached and maintain their selfless nature even in worldly situations are extremely rare, exceptional. Knowing this, the seeker should renounce worldly attachments as much as possible. This detachment can only be achieved by some rare, supreme Siddha Purushas. Others, who are not qualified, but dare to attempt to achieve it, will only suffer. The external causes that arise will corrupt them completely, and they will get lost in the maze of Maya and become "attached" instead of "detached." That is why knowledgeable men have forbidden all external attachments, knowing that the object of desire is a place of downfall. Their constant teaching is that even a single atom should not be attached to any object. And that is why they have placed a "red light" as a warning to those who are trying to practice selfless yoga. For example:

O Knowledgeable one! It is never right to do any karma. However, if you say, "I enjoy it, but I never possess anything," then alas! You are unfortunate. That is, you enjoy what you do not possess, meaning you are a wicked enjoyer. And if one says, "I am not bound by enjoyment, because I am not bound by the enjoyment of external objects," then 
x "Knowledgeable one, never do any karma. However, if it is said, "I enjoy it, but I never possess anything," then alas! You are unfortunate. That is, you enjoy what you do not possess, meaning you are a wicked enjoyer. And if one says, "I am not bound by enjoyment, because I am not bound by the enjoyment of external objects," then 
–Shri Amrit Chandracharya Ji's Shri Samaya Saar Kalash,

##  Kant Darsti: "Mind is the field of virtues and vices," the powerful Dharma Shakti

(537) The scriptures say, "Is this not a losing activity, a work of desire? And is it not bound? Therefore, O Knower! Become the form of knowledge, otherwise, you will surely be bound by the sins of your father. Similarly, those who are engrossed in the actions of the world, clinging to the path of karma, who do not know knowledge, are immersed, drowned in the ocean of the world. Even those who desire the path of knowledge, but are sluggish in their efforts, are also immersed, drowned in the ocean of the world. He swims above the world, who constantly becomes the form of knowledge, who never performs karma, and never succumbs to delusion."

Furthermore, it is said here that even though the Knower may experience some part of the world, he remains detached and unattached. This is said to indicate his extraordinary power of detachment. It is not said to imply that the Knower is always detached, but rather that even a Knower, who may be subject to the effects of past karma, remains detached. This is said to show his extraordinary, unwavering strength of detachment.

Because the Knower, the man of right vision, knows the object as an object, he does not identify with it. He believes with firm self-realization that he is not the father of it. And he does not even have the slightest attachment to it, even in his dreams. Just as a dry ball does not stick to a wall, so too, the truly detached Knower does not become bound by objects, he remains completely unattached. Even if he has to experience the world due to past karma, he does not get caught in it due to his complete detachment. He maintains this extraordinary awareness. This is truly the power of his knowledge, or the power of his detachment. Similarly,

Objects are not of the nature of virtues or vices, nor are they the mind's virtues or vices. Therefore, "There is no rule for objects in the production of bondage; the ignorant become bound by vices, the Knower never does. That which, when served, becomes impure, may also purify it, so says the scripture." (See Adhyatma Saar) But it is the desire and aversion that arises from the object that is the cause of bondage. Therefore, the mind is the field of virtues and vices, the place of their origin.

"Mind is the cause of bondage and liberation for humans," and the detached Knower behaves with such supreme detachment that he does not have even the slightest desire or aversion for objects. He is completely free from them.

+ "Knowledge is not for those who are attached to the world,
Even those who desire the path of knowledge, but are sluggish in their efforts, are immersed.
He swims above the world, who constantly becomes the form of knowledge, who never performs karma, and never succumbs to delusion." - Shri Samaya Saar Kalash 

Page #614:
---------------------------
(538)
The collection of yogic vision is present, meaning that even though they experience objects due to past karma, they remain completely indifferent and are not affected by the merits and demerits of those object experiences. They are supremely capable. "The mind is bound to the world by afflictions, the mind free from afflictions is the end of rebirth." - Shri Yashovijayji. "Such knowledge removes obstacles, there is no experience of rebirth; neither merits nor demerits, nor the form of objects, the mind is not affected by merits and demerits." - Shri Yo. Sakzayi - 7
Thus, the one who drowns in the ocean of enjoyment, the capable yogi swiftly swims across! The one who dies from the enjoyment of others, even such enjoyment does not become a cause of rebirth for them, does not lead to rebirth! Because "in this Kanti vision, due to the absence of attachment, the power of enjoyment is pure, it does not destroy the powerful Dharma Shakti that continuously flows with its own essence - just as a wire cannot extinguish a blazing fire, but instead helps it, similarly here, the karma that cannot be escaped without experiencing it is destroyed, so the powerful Dharma Shakti only helps the power of enjoyment, but does not oppose it due to weakness. What can a crocodile do to an elephant? What can a weak child do to a great wrestler? Even in a stable vision, the power of knowledge is so great that enjoyment cannot do anything to it, yet there is still some possibility of pleasure. But in this Kanti vision, it has been achieved by the knowledge-possessing householder, and the knowledge has become so powerful that even enjoyments, even emotions, cannot produce even a trace of pleasure! That is, enjoyment is obtained, but such a special knower does not become intoxicated by his own form, he remains stable in his form, unintoxicated, that is his powerful capability. Such an unintoxicated householder yogi is also a devotee. And thus, the knowledge-possessing, detached, unattached, wise man, free from attachment, continues to move forward towards the supreme state, without any hindrance.
"That vision crosses the ocean of rebirth, the Muni gains fame." - Sakzayi.
"The essence of enjoyment, however, is not the ocean of rebirth.
The strong attachment to the water of illusion, by that, who goes here by this path?" - 167
Commentary - Just as a peacock does not have the bondage of the ocean of rebirth, the essence of enjoyment, that is, the one for whom enjoyment is the ultimate goal, does not have the bondage of the ocean of rebirth, does not cross the ocean of rebirth - due to inactivity in his means, due to such intelligence, and the same is said - Maya-odesha - the one who is firmly attached to the illusionary water - due to such a type of withdrawal, the one who is firmly attached to the mirage water, by that: patha - because here he goes by this path - the way, where there is the intelligence of water in illusion. x "Dharma Shakti does not kill the stronger Bhog Shakti.
Just as a fire does not extinguish a fire, a monkey does not kill a lion." - Yashovakrut Dva. Dva. 24-15

It runs towards the collection of yogic vision, but it knows that it is false water, giving a hand-clap and running away like this! Nothing comes into the hand, and the thirst of the poor deer, instead of being quenched by the futile labor of running, increases instead! Just as it is impossible for the inert object and the conscious soul to be related, yet due to the delusion of the wrong vision (Illusion and Delusion), it appears to be related due to the inclusion of the self-consciousness in the inert object. That same object is a mirage. Believing that such illusory water is real, the foolish living being, the deer, tormented by the thirst for objects, runs towards it with full speed, it throws a lot of dust for that illusory water, but that illusory water, which is very illusory, seems to be mocking the life, as if it is saluting from afar, it keeps running away! And due to this futile pursuit of objects, due to the sorrow arising from the cycle of births and deaths, the thirst of the living being, which is like a path, instead of being quenched, increases instead, and therefore one has to bear the great suffering of the cycle of births and deaths. - This wrong vision is the root of all suffering. It binds the living being in the wrong way, creates self-consciousness in the non-self, and makes the mind believe in the external object. This wrong vision, which is beginningless and in the form of ignorance, creates self-consciousness in the body and other things, which are the means of enjoyment, and the living being forgets its true nature and thinks, "I am the body and other things." Then the soul, corrupted from its true form, remains active through the senses, falls into the object, and having obtained that object, it does not know the truth of itself, it forgets itself! As Shrimad Rajchandraji said in his characteristic style, "You have forgotten yourself, in what darkness are you?" Such a ridiculous story is created!
"I am not my own form, I am attracted to the pleasant object,
I have turned upside down, with the water of the thirst for objects." - After the origin of the thought of Shri Devchandraji, great men like Vaddhamana Swami thought again and again that this living being has been born and died countless times in the four states of existence since time immemorial, yet its state of birth and death, etc., does not diminish, how can it be diminished now? And what kind of mistake does this living being continue to make, which has resulted in this much? In this way, thinking again and again with utmost concentration, the mistake that the Lord saw as a result of the relationship, has been said in the Jinaagama again and again; that by knowing that mistake, the living being becomes a seeker of liberation, free from that mistake. The mistake of the living being seems to be infinite, but the fundamental mistake of all mistakes, which the living being should first consider, is...

The wise vision sees the object as a beggar, skilled in begging.
(54) The one who thinks of a fault, thinks of all faults, and the one who removes a fault, removes all faults. What living being would ever think of a small fault and want to get rid of it, but it is a duty, and the desire to get rid of many such faults easily becomes the cause of getting rid of the root fault. ”Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 413. (500)
The root cause of all these faults is the ignorance of the self-nature or the opposite of self-knowledge in the other, 'You have forgotten your own!' This is the biggest central fault. From this root fault, a tradition of other faults arises, the subject falls so much that its tendency becomes a beggar of objects. It becomes so absorbed in the objects of the five senses that it becomes a skilled beggar, forgetting its original form of the father, and considering the object as its all, it remains engrossed in its friction day and night! And due to the thirst for objects, it becomes hot and constantly experiences suffering, yet it does not leave the objects, nor does it leave the objects! And like a bee of lust, it keeps buzzing behind it! This object-loving living being, in the Shri Upamiti Bhavprapanch Katha, the great Siddharsi has described in an unparalleled style, like a skilled beggar, who strives for everything, and takes a begging bowl in his hand and wanders day and night for the sake of begging for objects! As if
“This living being wanders endlessly in this world city, in high and low houses, in the form of birth marks, under the influence of the hope and fear of objects.
“The body is weak due to hunger, he begs from house to house, he takes a begging bowl in his hand, he wanders day and night, he is condemned. The great fire of all-pervading anger, there the conscious self is attached;
Oh mother! Please save me!' He cries out in such a humble voice. Fever, madness combined, suffering from pain and suffering; He is the abode of all diseases, he is especially disturbed by the pain of suffering. He will get alms, he will get that house, etc., he thinks this; The mind becomes full of alternatives, it goes filled with anger. The place of compassion for the saints, the place of laughter for the believers, the abode of worms for the children, the special example for the sinners.”
-Shri U. B. Pr. Katha, Pr. 1 (Day. Bhagwandasakrut Sapghamgha Translation) “This living being, who wanders endlessly in the world, these words, etc., objects, and these friends, wealth, gold, etc., and these worms, stories, etc., other worldly things

It is appropriate to know the nature of *kaḍan* because the collection of *gaḍaṣṭi* is the cause, and it is due to the *gṛddhi* motive, the cause of *rāga* and other emotions, and the cause of the accumulation of *karma* in the form of great indigestion, and the cause of the *kaḍan*. (U.B.P. Katha) Such a *kaḍan* is the type of *bhikṣā* that this being desires to eat, and it is also the type of *chakravartī* that he desires. And this *chakravartī* also appears to be like a lowly *raṅka* to the *sat-sādhu*s, so what is the point of asking about the remaining states?

And even though this being is filled with *kaḍan* like wealth, objects, and spouses, his desires are not extinguished, but rather his thirst grows even stronger. Because just as a traveler who is overcome by thirst in the intense heat of summer, whose body is burning with fever, and who has fainted, does not experience any decrease in his thirst even when he drinks from a vast reservoir in a dream, so too does this being experience this with objects and so on. It is like this: This being, who has been revolving in the endless cycle of existence, has previously obtained countless words and so on in the realm of the gods, has obtained countless precious jewels, has enjoyed with beautiful women who would break the world of husbands, and has enjoyed the pleasures of the three worlds. Yet, this being is like someone with an empty stomach who has been starved for a long time, and he does not know anything about the stories of the devotees of the remaining days! He is simply consumed by his desires! Therefore, he does not experience satisfaction, but his hunger only increases!

–Śrī U.B.P. Katha (D, Bhagavān Dās M, Mehta's translation) This being experiences all these misfortunes because he runs after this *kaḍan* like a mirage, and he does not cross the ocean of existence. Because he has a strong attachment and false belief in the illusion of *māyā*, he does not have the desire to cross it, and he remains stuck in the mud of objects like a pig!

*sa tatra bhavo-dvigṇo yathā tiṣṭhaty-asaṁśayam |
mokṣa-mārge 'pi hi tathā bhoga-jambāla-mohitaḥ ||168||*

*Vṛtti:* *sa* - he, who has a strong attachment to the water of *māyā*, *ta* - there, in the path, in the way, *mohita* - he is deluded, *bhavo-dvigṇo* - he is troubled by existence, *caṇā* - like a chickpea, this is an example, *tiṣṭhaty-asaṁśayam* - he remains without doubt. *jala-buddhinaḥ samācātho* - like someone who is deluded by water, *mokṣa-mārge 'pi hi* - even in the path of liberation, which has endless qualities, *tathā* - so, *asaṁśaya-rithi-tiṣṭhaty* - he remains without doubt. *mohita* - he is deluded by *bhoga-jambāla* - the entanglement of enjoyment, and so on.

## Kanta Dristi: State in Bhava, Self-Consciousness in the External Body

(543) Just as one who is bewildered, remains steadfast in the path, so too, one who is deluded by the allure of enjoyment, remains steadfast in the path of liberation. 

**Meaning:** Just as one who is bewildered, remains steadfast in the path, so too, one who is deluded by the allure of enjoyment, remains steadfast in the path of liberation.

**Commentary:** The Bhagavata Purusha, who has a strong attachment to the water in the illusionary world, just as he remains steadfast in the path due to the influence of the water-consciousness, so too, he remains steadfast in the path of liberation, which is characterized by knowledge and other qualities, due to the delusion caused by the body and other intricacies, which are the cause of enjoyment.

The meaning of this is that the Bhagavata Purusha, who has an attachment to the water-consciousness in the illusionary world, due to the preconceived notion that this water is real and true, remains steadfast in the path, suffering from anxiety and sorrow due to the world. However, he does not progress towards liberation, knowing that there is no good in this. He does not make an effort to cross the ocean of the world, but remains steadfast in the enjoyment, dwelling in the enjoyment.

Similarly, he remains steadfast in the path of liberation, which is characterized by knowledge and other qualities, due to the delusion caused by the body and other intricacies, which are the cause of enjoyment. This means that he remains stuck where he is, he does not progress. The implication is that just as he remains steadfast in the path of Bhava, he also remains steadfast in the path of liberation, not progressing further. In other words, he remains submerged in the ocean of Bhava and does not progress towards liberation.

In this way, the soul, forgetting its original, inherent, pure form from time immemorial, is self-conscious in the external object due to ignorance, which is the form of Avidya or Mithyatva.

Due to the long-standing habit of identifying with the body and other external objects, his self-consciousness has become so externalized that it has taken deep roots. This has given rise to the perverse notion that "the body and other external objects are me." Due to the long association with the inert, he has become like the inert!

Thus, the soul, which is grasped by the self-consciousness in the body and other external objects, is called the external soul. This external soul, which is far from self-knowledge, forgets its own form, becomes deluded by the senses, and considers its body to be the soul. In the human body...

(544)
A person who is ignorant of the true nature of the soul considers the soul residing in a human body as a human, the soul residing in a non-human body as a non-human, the soul residing in a celestial body as a celestial being, and the soul residing in a hellish body as a hellish being. But they do not understand that the soul is not the body, it is not the physical form. The soul is the eternal, unchanging, self-aware, infinite knowledge and power. They mistakenly identify the soul with the body, mistaking the inanimate body for the soul. This mistaken identification of the soul with the body leads to a false sense of self, and this false sense of self leads to delusion about relationships like wife, children, etc. This delusion gives rise to a strong karmic imprint called Avidya, which leads to the belief that the body is the soul. This identification of the soul with the body is the root cause of all worldly suffering.

"The body is inert, the body is inert, the karma that binds the body, know the true nature of the soul. The soul is not the body, the soul is not the body, I have understood this truth, the fourfold unity. Namo Prabhu." - Shri Devchandraji.

Because of this mistaken identification of the soul with the body, the soul engages in activities related to the body and its senses. It strives to acquire wealth and other material possessions, which are considered tools for fulfilling desires. It develops attachment to things that are favorable and aversion to things that are unfavorable. It becomes angry towards those who stand in the way of its desires. It becomes proud and arrogant when it obtains even the smallest of pleasures, like a peacock dancing with pride. It becomes greedy for more and more, resorting to deceit and trickery to gain its desires, deceiving itself and others. In this way, the soul becomes entangled in the cycle of desires and passions, creating a web of karma and suffering, and becoming trapped in the cycle of birth and death. This cycle of suffering is driven by the mistaken identification of the soul with the body, which leads to desires and passions.

"The soul, turning away from the knowledge of its own true nature, identifies itself with the body through the senses. It mistakenly believes that the soul residing in a human body is a human, the soul residing in a non-human body is a non-human, the soul residing in a celestial body is a celestial being, and the soul residing in a hellish body is a hellish being. But it does not understand that the soul is not the body, it is not the physical form. The soul is the eternal, unchanging, self-aware, infinite knowledge and power. Seeing the inanimate body as similar to its own, the ignorant soul mistakenly identifies it as the soul. This mistaken identification of the soul with the body leads to delusion about relationships like wife, children, etc. This delusion gives rise to a strong karmic imprint called Avidya, which leads to the belief that the body is the soul. This identification of the soul with the body is the root cause of all worldly suffering. Therefore, one should abandon this mistaken identification and realize the true nature of the soul, which is beyond the body and the senses." - Shri Pujyapada Swami.

Kanta's vision, the state of non-progression on the path of liberation due to the enjoyment of objects.
(545) Filled with attachment, the enemy (of the soul) has troubled me, in the manner of a lake, much at night; under the influence of anger, pure virtues do not play, I am intoxicated with objects in this world...
"O Lord, my master, be merciful to your servant." - Shri Devchandraji. It is remembered that this wandering, only by self-destruction, does not bring indifference to the soul? Did it not know that being angry with others, being proud, being attached, being greedy, or doing otherwise is bad? Of course, it should have known, but it did not know, and this again gives dispassion to wander again. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 115 (128)
And then, in this trivial, object-like pleasure, this deluded soul is so colored, so engrossed in all the senses, that it remains immersed in its attainment, and considers it beautiful, it does not know anything else. Because it has not even dreamed of the taste of delicious food. So, just as a pig likes to lie in mud, so it likes to be engrossed in objects. Just as the fly of excrement liked the smell of excrement, so this fly of objects likes the smell of objects!
"It considers it beautiful, a rogue, it does not know anything else, a fool, it has not even attained the taste of delicious food."
U. B. Pr. 1 (Translation by Dr. Bhagvandas M. Mehta) Thus, this soul, colored by the attachment of the fruits of actions, colored by the senses, becoming the receiver and protector of external objects, becoming attached to the part of external objects, wanders in the world for an infinite time. And thus, missing the welfare of the father, this greatly deluded soul, like a beggar, takes up the burden of others, and needlessly suffers! The nectar of the words of the great souls of the liberated souls is:
"The color of the senses of the fruits of actions, the feeling of receiving from others... O Lord! Receiving from others, enjoying from others, is this nature? ... O Lord!" - Shri Devchandraji.
The action in which the soul is colored, there is its state, this is the opinion of the Jinas, it is true. The thirty great Mahamahaniya's Stanak Tirthankaras have said, it is true. - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 148 (Hathnedh, 2-19)

Yagdadisamuccaya
And thus, in the essence-less ocean of Maya, those who have a strong attachment, a strong attachment, such a Bhagatattva Purusha does not have the vision of his pure Atmaswaroop, so how can he enter Mokshamarg? Those who have gone astray in the labyrinth of the body, those who are confused by the Maya-prapaंच in the body, those who are trapped in the intricate, illusory web of the subject, which is the ocean of Maya, those who are colored by the Kshaya-rang due to the Rag-dvesh they do, and therefore those who have fallen into the endless cycle of Bhava-prapaंच, - such a Maha-meh-mudha Jeeva finds it difficult to attain Moksha. His state is in Mithyatva, so he does not move forward, he does not progress; because until the Kshaya is subsided, until there is no inner detachment from the subject, until there is no desire other than Moksha, until then, the eligibility to enter Mokshamarg is not attained, the true Mithyatva · Gunasthanak is not attained, and the first Mitra-darshti is not opened, then how can the above Bhagatattva Purusha enter Mokshamarg? And how can he move forward in it? How can he progress by attaining the Gunasthanas one after the other?
Mokshamarg Aprogression State
Thus, the Bhagatattva Purusha, who has the knowledge of the Tatva in his Bhaga, remains in the world, that is, he suffers endless suffering for an endless period of time. And he also remains in Mokshamarg. That is, he does not progress by developing his qualities, he remains where he is, like a worm! And thus, his suffering of rotation continues, and he does not get the remedy to remove it. So he suffers in both ways.

##  Kant's Perspective: A Detailed Examination, Dasanami Examination

(547) This perspective does not have attachment towards the essence of the eternal examination. Therefore, due to the cause that is inclusive of the essence, the certainty is always beneficial.

The essence examination, in this perspective, is the position of the right-visioned knowledgeable person, who is a capable essence-thinker and essence-examiner. Therefore, due to the continuous essence-examination in the form of contemplation, there is no possibility of any attachment here. Because, whoever understands the essence, does not become attached. And, in the right-vision, the destruction of the cause of attachment has already happened, and as one progresses on the path of yoga, the attachment to character also gradually diminishes, therefore, there is a complete absence of attachment.

The right-visioned person contemplates the essence in many ways. For example,

The knowledgeable persons who have attained the pure self-form, have described the following six stages as the most excellent dwelling places of right-vision: (1) The first stage - The self exists. Just as there are objects like pots and vessels, so too does the self exist. The examination of the second stage - Just as there is evidence of the existence of pots and vessels due to certain qualities, so too is there evidence of the existence of the self, which is the consciousness-being that is self-illuminating, and the quality of which is directly experienced. (2) The second stage - The self is eternal. Objects like pots and vessels are temporary. The self is eternal. Pots and vessels are objects that are associated with something else. The self is an object by nature, because there is no experience of any cause for its origin. Consciousness-being cannot be manifested from any associated substance, therefore, it is uncreated. Being uncaused, it is imperishable, because whatever is not created from any association, cannot be destroyed by any association. (3) The third stage - The self is the doer. All objects are capable of action and result. All objects are seen as having some result or action. The self is also capable of action, therefore, it is the doer. This doership has been examined by the three revered Jinas. By ultimate reality, it is the doer by nature's transformation of its own form. By unrefined (without special association that is fit to be experienced) practice, the self is the doer of the substance-karma. By refined practice, it is the doer of houses, cities, etc. (4) The fourth stage - The self is the experiencer. Whatever action there is, it is all fruitful, not futile. Whatever is done, the experience of its fruit is directly experienced. The fruit of poison is experienced by eating poison; the fruit of sugar is experienced by eating sugar; the fruit of touching fire is experienced by touching fire; the fruit of touching ice is experienced by touching ice. Just as the fruit of touching ice does not remain unexperienced, so too, whatever result the self experiences, whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, its fruit is also experienced.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
It is possible and it happens. The soul is the doer of the action, therefore it is the enjoyer. (5) The fifth step is the Ma-ksha-pad. - The one who has negated the doership of karma through reverse action, the one who has negated the enjoyership through doership, that is also the avoidance of karma. Because, even though there is intense suffering, etc., directly, but due to its non-study, due to its ignorance, due to its suppression, its mildness is seen, it appears to be capable of being destroyed; it can be destroyed. That blindness is capable of being destroyed, therefore the pure nature of the soul, which is devoid of it, is the form of Ma-ksha-pad. (6) The sixth step is the remedy for Ma-ksha. - If the karma-bandha were to happen only occasionally, then its liberation would never happen. But the means like knowledge, vision, samadhi, detachment, devotion, etc., which are opposite in nature to karma, are directly evident. By the power of these means, the karma-bandha becomes loose, it is suppressed, it is destroyed. Therefore, that knowledge, vision, samayam, etc., are the remedies for the Ma-ksha-pad. ’’
(For details, see) Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 409 (493) Author: Nij Karyam;
66
The soul is eternal, it is the enjoyer, and there is liberation, liberation is the remedy.
Six standpoints in brief, six visions also this;
Understood by the Supreme, said
By the knower this. - Shri Atmasiddhi.
“ Muni Suvrat Jinraj! My one request to the wise;
The soul principle, the world-teacher! This thought I say;
Without knowing the soul principle, the mind-samadhi is not attained. - Shri Anandghanaji.
Furthermore, this soul principle, regarding the six visions, the wise man explains in detail as follows: (1) Some consider the soul principle to be undivided, but this soul is seen to be doing actions, then who will enjoy the fruits of those actions? (2) Some say that the inert and the conscious are both one soul, the stationary and the mobile are the same. But in that, there is no occurrence of the arrangement of happiness and sorrow, and the defect called Sankara arises, this is seen by the mind when examined. (3) Some who are absorbed in self-vision say that the soul principle is eternal, but in that, there is the defect of destruction of the done karma, and the defect of arrival of the undone karma, these are not seen by the foolish.
Mimamsa
“ Which blind one considers the soul principle, seeing it doing actions;
The fruits of the actions, who will enjoy? Thus the mind asks. - Muni Suvrat.

##  The Examination of the Path and its Resultant Vision

**Katha Darsti Padanmimamsa, Atmatattvamimamsa**

(549) The inert and the conscious, this self is one, like the stationary and the mobile; sorrow, happiness, and mixed suffering arise, the mind contemplates and discerns. The Muni says, the self-principle is eternal, by seeing the self; the destruction of the done, the arrival of the undone, the defilement, is not seen by the foolish. Muni - Shri Anandghanji

(4) Some say, "This soul is momentary, know it." But believing so, the bondage, the arrangement of happiness and sorrow, will not diminish, bringing this thought to mind is necessary. (5) Some say, "There is no separate self-existence apart from the four elements." But the blind cannot see the cart, what fault is there in the cart? - Thus, the mind, fallen into the predicament of the confusion of the opinions of many disputants, does not attain tranquility, and without truly understanding the self-principle, it does not arise, how should the seeker of liberation act? "The worldly-minded say, the soul is momentary, know it, bondage, happiness, sorrow will not diminish, bring this thought to mind. Muni, the self-principle is separate from the four elements, there is no separate existence; the blind cannot see the cart, what fault is there in the cart? Muni, thus, the confusion of the opinions of many disputants, fallen into the predicament, does not attain tranquility; for that, I ask, without you, no one can tell the truth, Muni" - Shri Anandghanji.

Then, the inner self (or the Supreme Self) answers him, "Oh self! Abandon all partiality, and with the mind fixed on the one self-principle, free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, begin! Whoever contemplates this self, does not return to this, and knows that everything else is illusory, brings this principle to mind, therefore, the side that brings about the discrimination of body and soul is worthy of acceptance, and that is called the knower of the truth." Therefore, the inner self again speaks to him, "Oh self-form, Anandghan Prabhu! "Muni Suvrat! He who grants grace, "Let us attain the state of Anandghan."

"The world-teacher, in turn, speaks, abandon all partiality; free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, what is the self, fix your mind on it - Muni Suvrat, whoever contemplates the self, does not return to this, knows that everything else is illusory, brings this principle to mind. Muni, he who has discrimination, accepts that side, he is called the knower of the truth: Muni Suvrat, he who grants grace, let us attain the state of Anandghan. Muni" - Shri Anandghanji.

Thus, the examination of the path and the resultant vision arising from it, etc.

(550)
This great knower of the truth, having abandoned all other five senses, becomes absorbed in pure self-meditation,
and contemplates that I am the pure, conscious, self-existent soul, distinct from the body and the like. "Having fallen from this great form, I fell into the objects through the senses. I obtained those objects, and I" did not know me before by the truth! That which does not grasp the ungraspable, and does not release the grasped, which knows everything in every way, that self-conscious one, I am. Seeing me, who am the self-knowledge-self-existent, in truth, passions and the like are extinguished here, therefore there is no great enemy, nor any great dear friend. Not seeing me, this world is not my enemy, nor my friend." Thus, the knower, having abandoned the external self and established himself in the internal self, feels that the Supreme Self is I, and I am the Supreme. Therefore, I am the one to be worshipped by me, not anyone else, is the state. Having been freed from the objects, I have surrendered to the self-existent, full of supreme bliss, who is established in me by himself. " etc. In this way, he destroys the delusion of perception through the contemplation of the self. And therefore, he develops the supreme subtle knowledge where the self-experienced knowledge of the pure consciousness, distinct from the body, prevails. Then, he has such a meditation on that pure form that it tends to completely extinguish the conduct. For example -
Conduct is a great defeat | He is indifferent to all emotions, and he considers the body only for the purpose of restraint, he does not conceive anything else for any other reason, and
he does not have even a little bit of attachment to the body. He makes the yoga of mind, speech, and body as concise as possible, and he makes the secrecy of the three concise yogas stable in the self, and he mainly lives in the state of the body like a mountain. His self-stability is so firm that
he cannot be affected by fear of home, society, or adversity.
*"Having fallen from this great form, I fell into the objects through the senses. I obtained those objects, and I" did not know me before by the truth! That which does not grasp the ungraspable, and does not release the grasped, which knows everything in every way, that self-conscious one, I am. Seeing me, who am the self-knowledge-self-existent, in truth, passions and the like are extinguished here, therefore there is no great enemy, nor any great dear friend. Not seeing me, this world is not my enemy, nor my friend." Thus, the knower, having abandoned the external self and established himself in the internal self, feels that the Supreme Self is I, and I am the Supreme. Therefore, I am the one to be worshipped by me, not anyone else, is the state. Having been freed from the objects, I have surrendered to the self-existent, full of supreme bliss, who is established in me by himself. " etc.
–Shri Pujyapada Swami Ji's Shri Samadhi Shatak,

Kanta's vision, character, and attachment are defeated, always leading to welfare.
(551) And he performs the activities of the three-fold body (mind, speech, and body) only for the purpose of restraint, and that too with constant attention to his own self-nature and in accordance with the command of the Vitaraga Dev. Even that brief activity is constantly diminishing in its state of being, and finally merges into its own nature. (See p. 25, the supreme self-seer Shrimad Rajchandraji has sung this in the form of an experience of the soul, "An unprecedented opportunity, an unprecedented unique poem - which has been embodied in this form").
He remains indifferent to all emotions, only the body is for the purpose of restraint; he does not do anything else for any other reason, even in the body, he does not even have a slight desire.
When will such an unprecedented opportunity come? " - Shrimad Rajchandraji, in the matter of the five senses, he is free from attachment and aversion, he does not have any evil thoughts; his mind is not disturbed by the five types of pleasures; he wanders freely without any restriction from matter, field, time, and emotion, being subject to the arising of karma, which is the result of past actions. He behaves with self-compassion towards anger! He has humility towards pride! He has a witness-like vision, a vision of non-attachment towards Maya! And towards greed, he does not consider himself equal to the gain, he does not care for those who cause much trouble. Even when a Chakravarti comes and pays homage, he does not feel pride in him, even when the body leaves, he does not feel any attachment in his love. Even when powerful gains and achievements are revealed, he does not even touch greed.
He treats enemies and friends equally, his nature remains the same in honor and dishonor, he does not consider himself inferior or superior in life or death,
and he treats the world and the beyond with pure equanimity. Equanimity everywhere: he wanders alone in the cremation ground, and also wanders in the mountains or where there are lions, tigers, and monkeys; yet his seat remains firm and no kind of emotion arises in his mind, but
he knows as if he has met his best friend. Even when he performs severe austerities, his mind does not become heated, and he does not feel happy with pleasant things. Whether it is a speck of dust or the wealth of a celestial being, he believes that all are of the nature of a single particle.
Thus, he also defeats the attachment to character, so due to the absence of attachment in all respects, due to the cause of the inclusion of the elements - due to the extreme perfection of austerity, he always has welfare.

There is a collection of right views. The *Mimamsa-deepika*, which dispels the darkness of delusion, through its four principles of illumination, always brings about well-being and constantly fosters the growth of self-welfare and Dharma. The nature of the self, which is the essence of Dharma, becomes increasingly revealed and manifest. Thus, the state of the self progressively ascends to higher levels, and it becomes established on a series of increasingly excellent qualities of the self. Just as the moon, in its waxing phase, reaches its fullness, so too, this great soul, the *yogi* with right view, attains its full form as the beneficial moon progressively waxes.
“Fear is dispelled by the state of being a devotee,
False knowledge is like a swarm of bees;
This view crosses the ocean of existence,
The sage gains fame.
Hail, hail, the rule of the Jina!” – Shri K.D. Sajjay. –
E
Right view: Chapter 12, like a star, gives 12 kinds of charity.
Giving up other mental defilements.
Holding fast to the Dharma.
Gaining the qualities of *Mimamsa*.
– Essence of Right View – In the sixth right view, the constant perception, withdrawal, non-attachment, subtle understanding, etc., mentioned in the previous view, are present, and they inspire love in others. In addition, here the sixth *anga* called *dharana* is attained. Due to this supreme *dharana*, there are no mental defilements called *anyamud*, meaning the mind does not find pleasure in anything other than Dharma. And there is a constant *Mimamsa*, a contemplation that brings about well-being.
In this view, due to the greatness of Dharma, there is perfect purity of conduct. And therefore, this *yogi* with this view becomes dear to all beings, and he is single-minded in Dharma. His mind is always absorbed in fulfilling his duty, and his body is engaged in other activities – just as the mind of a virtuous woman is absorbed in her household duties, even while she is engaged in other tasks. + “*Mimamsa-deepika* dispels the darkness of delusion.
Know the principles in their essence!” – Shri Dva Dva. 24-15

##  Kanta Darsti: Essence, Gadarsti Kalash Kavya

(553) The one who is completely absorbed in the husband of their father, does not become entangled in the cycle of birth and death due to the knowledge of the accuser. 

Just as a man, seeing the illusion of Maya in its true form, fearlessly walks through it without being affected, similarly, the one who sees the illusion of Maya in its true form, even though they are entangled in it, remains detached and moves towards the ultimate goal. But the one who sees the illusion of Maya as their true self, does not escape the ocean of birth and death. Because their intellect, due to its nature, remains inactive in its solution. 

The one who is firmly attached to the illusion of Maya due to their wrong perception, where will they go in this Maya, where there is the intellect of water? Therefore, they remain suffering from the pain of birth and death, just as they remain in the same place, they remain in the path of liberation, but they do not progress.

This vision is always free from the allure of delusion due to the constant contemplation of the true nature of things, therefore, the wise man, who is free from delusion, always experiences progress, meaning, the continuous progress of the state of the self, leading to the ultimate welfare of the self.

## Yog Darsti Kalash Kavya

Kanta, like Hari, always has the vision of Kanta, the vision of Kanta, which shines brightly with the light of your vision; the subtle light of the consciousness illuminates the sky, strengthened by the power of the contemplation of the true nature of things. 127

Just as the sword is different from the sheath, the soul is different from the body and other things, it is imperishable and useful, it is always seen as such; the yogi, with the firm resolve of the supreme self, adopts the form of the self, and never gets attached to the influence of others. 128

The yogi, by acting in accordance with the nature of the self, achieves purity of conduct; the one who is absorbed in the supreme self, who is the embodiment of Dharma, is very dear to the people due to the glory of Dharma. 129

## Gadashtisamuccaya

**The sixth aspect of the Yogadrishtisamuccaya:**

**In the Shrauta Dharma, the mind should always be focused, the body should be engaged in other activities, just as a woman's mind is always absorbed in her husband, just as a cow goes into the forest, grazes, wanders in all directions, but its gaze is always fixed on its calf.** (130)

**The Shrauta Dharma, whose mind is always focused in this way, is not bound by the knowledge of the knower! Even in the midst of the illusory Maya, it remains eternally free from the self, like a lotus flower that does not get stained by the water.** (131)

**Just as a person sees a mirage as a mirage, the senses move freely without any attachment; similarly, when one sees the illusory world as it is, one remains detached and moves towards the ultimate goal.** (132)

**One who considers the illusory world as real, cannot cross the ocean of existence, he is bound by the illusory world and does not move on the right path; he remains there, tormented by the illusory world, and even the path to liberation becomes a source of attachment for him.** (133)

**I am pure knowledge, everything else is evil, this firm truth is strengthened by the constant consumption of the nectar of knowledge; does the yogi, who is always absorbed in contemplation, ever fall into attachment or external influence? He always finds joy in the nature of Bhagavandas.** (134)

**Thus, in the Kiratchandrasonumanahsukhanandana, composed by the great sage Shri Haribhadracharya, the sixth aspect of the Yogadrishtisamuccaya is explained in detail in the Sumanonandani Brihattika, by Bhagavandas.**

## Prabha Drishti

The sixth Drishti has been explained. Now the seventh is being told -

**Dhyanpriya Prabha prayo nasyaam rugat ev hi. Tarvatipatti yuta sastravruttipavi* || 270 ||**

Prabha Drishti is generally Dhyanpriya, therefore, there is no fault of "Ga" in this. This Drishti is Tatvapratipatti yukt, meaning it is accompanied by the true experience of the soul, and it brings about the Satpravritti pad.

**Commentary:**

Prabha is like the sun's rays, Dhyanpriya is the seventh yogaanga, the absence of the seventh "Sa" defect, and the seventh Tatvamatipatti guna are present in this seventh Prabha Drishti. This Drishti is generally Dhyanpriya, and especially it is accompanied by Shama and therefore brings about the Satavrittipad - Satpravrittipad.

**Conclusion:**

It has been stated that this Drishti is "Satyaavrittipadavaha", meaning it brings about the Satpravrittipad.

**Alternative Reading:**

It is especially accompanied by Shama. Here, Vritti appears to be incomplete or broken.

It is fitting to compare this seventh insight to the radiance of the sun, as the sun's light is many times stronger than that of a star. Similarly, the seventh insight, Prabha Drishti, is many times more powerful and profound than the sixth insight, Kanta Drishti. Calling it "Prabha" is also accurate, as Prabha means the pervading, all-encompassing light. Just as the sun's radiance is intensely bright, this insight's all-pervading light is intensely bright, powerful, and capable of penetrating. As sunlight illuminates all objects and the entire world, this insight's all-pervading light reveals the true nature of all objects.

The seventh limb of yoga, Dhyana (meditation), is characterized by this pervading, all-encompassing light. Therefore, these two, Dhyana and this insight, are constantly intertwined. Knowledge and meditation are interconnected; the stronger the knowledge, the stronger the meditation. This insight is thus conducive to meditation, a beloved companion to meditation, where meditation is deeply cherished by the yogi. Therefore, the yogi, the wise man, who is established in this state, meditates on the undivided self, which is most dear to him. And because this self-meditation is sharp, self-aware, and rooted in the self, there is rarely any room for distractions to arise; it is thus free from distractions.

After attaining the sixth limb, Dharana (concentration), the seventh limb, Dhyana (meditation), arises naturally. Dharana means focusing the mind on a specific object or area, and through repeated impressions, the mind is drawn towards its essence and becomes concentrated there. Dharana, which involves holding the mind towards the nature of the self, gives rise to Dhyana, which is the concentration of the mind on the self. "Yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ" (Yoga Sutras 1.2). Dharana involves the mind's focus on the essence of the object, while Dhyana involves the direct realization of the pure self. "Tatra pratyakṣa eva jñānataṁ sthānam" (Yoga Sutras 3.2). The unification of the mind's focus in the realm of Dharana, meaning the continuous flow of a single, undivided result in the realm of Dharana, is Dhyana. (See Dva. Dva.) "Steady determination is Dhyana, and unsteady mind is Bhavana, Anuprekṣā, or Chinta, these three. In one sense, the final state of the mind is Dhyana. In the context of multiple meanings, even a long-lasting state, if it is unbroken and undivided, is a continuous stream of Dhyana." (See Adhyatma Sara).

There are four main types of Dhyana: (1) Atma, (2) Raudra, (3) Dharma, (4) Shukla. Of these, Atma and Raudra are undesirable, as they are the causes of the dualistic world and are unrefined and harmful.

##  Prāśa Dṛṣṭi: Meditation, the Steady-Minded Meditator with Four Virtues

(557)

And the soul, for the seeker of liberation, is completely contemptible - worthy of being abandoned. The rest, however, are the cause of Dharma and Śukla Mokṣa, highly praiseworthy and desirable, and for the soul, the seeker of liberation, they are completely worthy of being embraced, to be honored with the utmost respect. Or, one can understand the four types of meditation as being in the form of the body, in the form of the senses, in the form of the form, and beyond form. To understand these types of meditation in detail, the inquisitive should observe the Śrī Jñānāva, Adhyātmasāra, Yāgaśāstra, Mākṣamālā, and other such scriptures. The ultimate goal of all these types of meditation is to be established in the meditation of the pure soul. Therefore, Ātma-dhyāna (meditation on the soul) is the main meditation. Here, to truly understand the nature of meditation, it is necessary to understand the nature of the meditator, the object of meditation, etc. -

**The Nature of the Meditator**

The meditator, the person who performs this meditation, should be worthy, and for that, they should be endowed with the four excellent virtues of knowledge, faith, conduct, and detachment. They should be imbued with these four virtues, with a firm and unwavering mind. Because, through the virtue of knowledge, there is steadiness; through the virtue of faith, the mind becomes stable and unperturbed; through the virtue of conduct, the past karma is destroyed; and through the virtue of detachment, the desires and fears associated with attachment are eradicated. That is, due to detachment, the mind does not become attached to anything, and it does not have any desires or aspirations related to this world or the next, and it does not become disturbed by any kind of fear. Thus, the mind of one who is imbued with these four virtues becomes stable. And, the one who has a stable mind is the one who is worthy of meditation; others, with unstable minds, are not worthy. For the attainment of meditation, stability of mind is the first and foremost requirement. The supreme seer of the soul, Śrīmad Rājacandraji, has said in his profound statement of truth, "I will tell you when I understand, when my mind becomes stable." Similarly, the Gītā also says, "For the uncontrolled mind, yoga is difficult to attain, I believe. But for the one who has control over the mind and senses, yoga is attainable through effort." - All this truly happens in the soul imbued with the above virtues. Śrī Nemicandracārya has said in the Br̥had Dravyasaṅgraha, "If you want to know about the different types of meditation, then..."

" निश्चलत्त्रमसंमोहो निर्जरा पूर्वकर्मणाम् । सङ्गाशंसा भयोच्छेदः फलान्यासां यथाक्रमम् ॥ स्थिरचित्तः किलैताभिर्याति ध्यानस्य योग्यताम् । योग्यतैव हि नान्यस्य तथा चोक्त ं परैरपि । ” —Śrī Yaśavijayajīkṛta Adhyātmasāra

"If you want your mind to be steady, then you should be indifferent to both pleasant and unpleasant objects, you should not be attached to them, you should not hate them."
"Ma mujjaha ma rajjaha ma dussaha ini?atthesu. Thiramicchaha jai chittan vicittjjaanapassiddhie."
-Sri Nemichandra Siddhantachkravattakrut Brihad Dravyasangraha, Thus, the one who is free from passions due to the victory of the mind and senses, is calm and restrained. That is, he is calm due to the cessation of passions, and he is restrained due to the control of the senses. The characteristics of calmness and restraint of the sthitaprajna mentioned in the Gita are fully present in this calm and restrained yogi. "Arjuna, when one abandons all desires arising from the mind, and is content with the Self alone, then he is called sthitaprajna. His mind is not disturbed by sorrow, nor does he crave for happiness. He is free from attachment, fear, and anger. Such a muni is called sthitaprajna. This calm and restrained man is truly content with the Self.
And this yogi who has the seventh vision is certainly a meditator of the highest order, because he has become extremely steady-minded and sthitaprajna through the highest yogic practices so far. (1) Through the knowledge of subtle elements and their analysis, this one who has the subtle vision has developed a superior understanding of knowledge and vision. (2) Through the observance of the five yamas of ahimsa, etc., the practice of the niyamas of purity, contentment, etc., the firmness of the sukhasana that calms the mind, the practice of pranayama that involves the expulsion of external thoughts and the filling and emptying of the inner self, the withdrawal of the senses from objects, and the firm holding of the mind in meditation on dharma, thus, through the continuous practice of yoga, through repeated contemplation, his character has become of the highest order. (3) And this samyagdarshi, the wise man who has such a superior understanding of knowledge, vision, and character, is imbued with the highest detachment, therefore, he is completely indifferent, he does not attach himself to anything, he does not have any desires related to this world or the next, he has no thirst for life, and he is not disturbed by the thought of death. "प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् । आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ।। दुःखेऽपि च प्रसन्नतां गच्छत्यत्मा विपश्यतः । सुखेऽपि च न विक्षिप्तिः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ।। वीतरागः वीतभयः वीतशोकः समाहितः । ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ब्रह्मभूतोऽधिवासितः ।।" -Gita,
"सुविदिदपदत्यसुत्तो संजमतवसंजुदो विगतरागो। समणो समसुदुक्खो भणिदो सुद्धोवओगोत्ति ॥"
-Sri Kundakundacharya's Sri Pravachansara

##  Prabha Drushti: Vastu Svaroopa Dhyan, Arihant Dhyan, Siddha Dhyan

(559) Such a being is free from all fear, a true Avadhoot, a fearless one. Yogishwar Rajchandraji's concise Vachanamrut says:

"There is no thirst for life, no fear of death; the great soul desires, the ultimate yoga of victory." - Shreemad Rajchandraji.

Thus, a Yogi, whose very bones and marrow are imbued with the noble sentiments of knowledge, vision, character, and detachment, and whose soul is deeply immersed in self-reflection, is free from the defects that cause mental distractions. Therefore, such a Yogi experiences extreme mental stability. This stable-minded, steady-willed, self-contented, peaceful, and detached Yogi, being endowed with all the elements of meditation, is not attracted to anything, neither desirable nor undesirable, nor does he harbor attachment or aversion. Therefore, this ultimate Nigranth, the detached Muni, is the ultimate destination for the ultimate, pure self-meditation.

##  Dhyeya Swaroop (The Object of Meditation)

Dhyeya means the subject or object of meditation. The ultimate goal of contemplating any object is to attain self-meditation. Whatever is contemplated, if it leads the soul to a state of pure, undistracted awareness and single-pointed focus, then it is a Dhyeya. The main Dhyeyas are: (1) Conscious or unconscious, animate or inanimate objects, (2) Pancha Parameshthi, (3) The Soul.

1. **Vastu** (Objects) are divided into two categories: conscious and unconscious. They possess the essence of existence, characterized by creation, sustenance, and dissolution. Each substance, endowed with its own unique qualities, exists in its own inherent state. Every object, existing due to its own substance, space, time, and qualities, is non-existent due to other substances, space, time, and qualities. In other words, an object does not simultaneously possess its own form and the form of another, nor does it transgress the boundaries of its own time and enter another's. What is inert, remains inert in its effects, and what is conscious, remains conscious in its effects. Nothing changes its nature. What is inert, remains inert in all three times, and what is conscious, remains conscious in all three times. This is evident from experience, so why doubt it? And so on, contemplating the nature of any object leads the soul towards contemplating the pure nature of its own self, and ultimately ascends to the meditation of the pure soul.

"Inertness leads to inert effects, consciousness to conscious effects;
Nothing changes its nature, abandoning its own essence. What is inert, remains inert in all three times, and what is conscious, remains conscious as well;
This is evident from experience, so why doubt it?" - Shreemad Rajchandraji.

The collection of yogic views, part 2, or the five supreme beings, are to be chanted with the mantras that describe them (meditation with a fixed object). This is also the best subject for meditation, the best goal.
"Namo Arihantaṇam, Namo Siddhaṇam, Namo Ayariyāṇam, Namo Uvzahayāṇam, Namo Loe Sabvasahūṇam."
(1) The one whose four karmas are destroyed, and therefore has infinite vision, infinite knowledge, infinite power, and infinite bliss, that auspicious, pure soul is
"Worthy of meditation." The one who has attained samadhi, the supreme soul, the Arihant, who, despite having a body, moves in a state of transcending the body, that pure soul, who is naturally in his own form, is the Arihant-Jin,
the Bhagavan-Omniscient Supreme Being. The essential pure form of this liberated embodied Supreme Being is the ultimate goal for the seeker, worthy of meditation; because through meditation on this naturally existing pure soul, the soul becomes established in meditation on the pure soul's own form. Therefore, meditation on this "Supreme Being" is the ultimate goal for the seeker, as it is a support for him. Through the support of the Jina, the soul becomes self-reliant and meditates on its own form.
"In the meditation of Nemi Prabhu, there is oneness, unity in one's own essence;
In the meditation of Shukal, one attains perfection, one attains liberation in the end." - Shri Devchandraji. "The one whose state is without a body, whose tendencies are always active in the self-awareness;
The one who has attained the state of liberation from the six karmas, I bow to that greatness, the most excellent in the world."
Shri Arihant Stotra (written by Dr. Bhagvandas M. Mehta) (2) The one whose eight karmas and body are destroyed, the one who is the knower and seer of the Kalak, that Siddha soul, who is situated in the Kashikhar, is to be meditated upon." The destruction of all karmic impurities
The one who has attained the pure soul, the Siddha, who is without a body, the meditation on that pure soul, the Siddha, is revealed, the one who has attained his own natural form,
the one who has attained Kaivalya, the state of being one with the form, through the manifestation of the pure consciousness of the self-essence - that pure soul, the Siddha Bhagavan, is the ultimate goal -

## Prabha Drishti: Contemplation of the Siddhas, Contemplation of the Acharyas, etc.
(561)

This is worthy of the highest contemplation. Because it is the pure Atma-Vastu-Dharma manifested by the Bhagwan, the complete purity of all Atma-Gunas has been attained, they have become the doer and enjoyer of their own nature, they are experiencing the joy and result of that, the purity of all Atma-Pradeshas has arisen in them, the Chaitanya-maya Tattva-pan has been manifested and attained by them, they are both the perceiver and the perceived, the pervader and the pervaded, all are Chaitanya-maya - this Chaitanya-maya Tattva-Avastha-Siddha-Dasha has been manifested. "Dharma Pragu-Bhavata, Sakal Guna Shuddhata, Katruta Bhegyata, Raman Parinamata; Shuddha Swapradeshata, Tattva Chaitanya, Vyapy Vyaphak Tatha Grahya Grahakagata... Dharma Jagnathno Dharma Shuchi Gaiye, Aapne Atama Teho Bhavie!" - Shri Devchandraji. "Prabhupad Valagya Te Rahya Taja, Alag Ang Na Saaja Re; Vachhak Yash Kahe Avar Na Dhyau, E Prabhu Na Gun Gau Re" - Shri Yashovijayji. "Khata Karai Khatam Kamtana Samasat, Pamaya Gati Ja Apunarbhav Je Prashast; Jene Surya Chaugati Rath Chak Chaare, Te Siddha Ne Charan Ho Sharanu Amaare!" - Shri Siddha Stotra (Dr. Bhagwandas Mansukh Bhai Mehta Virchit)

Through contemplation of such manifested, innate, self-existent Siddha Prabhu, the Atma contemplates its own nature, because the Atma-Jati of the Paramatma and the Atma is one. The pure Dharma of the Dharma-Moorti, Dharma-Nath, Paramatma, is the same as the Atma's inherent nature, Dharma, in the three Man-Mandirs. Thus, the nature of that which is one, never changes or shifts. In the liberated Paramatma, the Paramatma Tattva, which is supremely blissful, remains manifest due to the absence of all attachments. In the Samsari Atma, it remains latent, in the form of Shakti, due to the occasion of the Parbhavas, which are like Upadhis. In other words, in the Samsari Jiva, the Paramatma-pan is in the form of Shakti, and in the Siddha, it is in the form of Vyakti. Therefore, for the sake of that Shakti-rupa Paramatma-pan, one should immerse oneself in the devotion of the actual Paramatma Tattva, who has attained the manifestation of his Vyakti. Through such Tanmaya Dhyana, Samapti occurs, meaning that Samarsi-Bhav arises, unification happens, where the Atma merges into the Paramatma without distinction. Thus, through contemplation of the pure Paramatma, the pure Atma is manifested. Therefore, the contemplation of this Siddha Parameshthi is always worthy of contemplation for the Mumukhu in the Man-Mandir - it is the supreme Ishta.

"Mam Shaktya Gunagrama Vyaktva Cha Parameshthinah. Etavanavayor Bhedah Shaktivyaktisvabhavathah. So'yam Samarsi Bhavastadeekaranam Smritam. Aprithaktvena Yatraatma Liyate Paramatmani." - Shri Shubhachandracharyaji-Krit Shri Gnanav.

Yoga-darshan-samuchchay: “Three things arise from my soul, all my wealth is born from me; three things are contemplated by the Lord of Dharma in the temple of the mind, the Supreme Devchandra attains his own Siddhi and happiness.” “When the essence of truth is contemplated, one becomes aware of one’s own essence; the essence of meditation is concentration, that is the fulfillment of the essence.” “The purity of the pure Jinraj, which is contemplated in the temple of the mind; contemplation is the essence of the earth with its attributes, contemplation is oneness without attributes.”
Blessed are you! Blessed are you! Blessed is the Jinraj! – Shri Devchandraji. (3-4-5)
And – “The excellent thoughts that are the essence of darshan and knowledge, the soul that is in both self and others, in the conduct of character and the conduct of penance, such is the goal of the Acharya Muni –
It is worthy of contemplation. He who is endowed with the three jewels and is immersed in the eternal teachings of Dharma, the Acharya, the Upadhyaya, the soul who is the bull among the ascetics, salutations to him! (He is also a goal) The eternal pure character that is the essence of darshan and knowledge, the path to liberation,
He who practices it is the ascetic Muni, salutations to him!” This too is worthy of contemplation. – This Acharya, Upadhyaya, and ascetic are the pure souls who are constantly engaged in the practice of their innate nature, the innate pure nature of the soul, and who are established in a high state of virtue. Therefore, such great souls who are the embodiment of the pure soul are the supreme object of devotion, as their contemplation of the form of the soul inspires the soul to become established in self-contemplation. – Thus, the five supreme beings, etc., are all objects of devotion, the purpose of which is to become established in the contemplation of the soul, for “When the ascetic contemplates anything and becomes one with it, and becomes devoid of desire, then he has definite contemplation, that is, contemplation of the pure soul. Just as a ladder, etc., is needed to climb a palace, so too, the supreme beings, etc., are of great benefit in climbing to the definite contemplation of self-contemplation.
3. Or, the soul is the main object of contemplation. The ultimate goal and fruit of all the other objects mentioned above is also this self-contemplation. Because, through the contemplation of the pure soul, the embodiment of the Arihant Siddha, etc., the mind becomes pure, stable, and concentrated. *"दसणणाणपहाणे वीरेयचारित्ततवायारे । अप्पं परं च जुजइ सो आयरिओ मुणी झेओ। जो रयणत्तयजुत्तो णिच्चं धम्मोवएसणे णिरदो । सो उवज्झाओ अप्पा जदिवरवसहो णमो तस्स ॥ दसणणाणसमग्गं मग्गं मोक्खस्स जो हु चरितं । साधयदि णिच्चसुद्धं साहू स मुणी णमो तस्स ।। जं किंचिवि चितंतो णिरीहवित्त। हवे जदा साहू । लध्धूणय एयत्तं तदाहु तं तस्स णिच्छयं झाणं ॥"

## Prabha Drushti: Shukal Atmadhyan, Prabhu's Pidastghyan (563)

It happens that for a pure man, who is free from attachment, Shukal Atmadhyan, which is a firm conviction, is the most suitable for meditation. Therefore, the one who meditates on the Supreme Being, who is full of virtues, with complete devotion, experiences the pure soul and attains the state of the Supreme Being.

**Parmaguni Tanmayata Sevan, Nishchay Dhyane Dhyaveji;
Shuddhatma Anubhav Asvadi, Devchandra Pad Paveji. Shri Chandraprabh'-Shri Devchandraji,**

And these great souls, who have this vision, are most suitable for the beginning of this pure Atmadhyan, because through the excellent worship of Dharma Dhyan, these self-knowing, selfless, and dedicated souls have become calm, peaceful, and unwavering in this vision. They have become absorbed in the feeling of the self, and have become established in the state of self-realization. They have accumulated an extraordinary store of self-knowledge and non-self-knowledge, which is essential for climbing the ladder of Shukal Dhyan, which is the most suitable form of meditation for the pure soul.

Therefore, this soul, who is meditating, feels inspired by this extraordinary self-knowledge and says, "Although I am like the sun, who develops the lotus of infinite virtues, alas! I was deprived by my enemies in this great forest! Bound by the countless chains of attachment, etc., which arose from self-delusion, I wandered in this terrible cycle of birth and death for an infinite time! Today my fever of attachment has subsided, today my sleep of ignorance has gone, therefore, with the sword of meditation, I will kill my enemies of karma."

Furthermore, he feels, "I am the one, without whom I was sleeping, and with whose grace I have awakened. I am the one who is beyond the senses, indescribable, and self-evident. I am the Supreme Being, and the Supreme Being is me. Therefore, I am the one who is worthy of worship by me, and no one else." This is the state of being. This feeling of self-awareness does not involve any attachment or aversion. Because he thinks, "What is inert is visible, and what is conscious is invisible. So, where should I have attachment, and where should I have aversion?" Therefore, I...

"I become the middle." And everywhere, the soul, being devoid of attachment, becomes absorbed in the pure self-meditation, and its supreme blissful emotions emerge:
Oh! Oh! I say to myself, I bow to myself, I bow to myself; the infinite fruit, the gift of the giver, which has become your gift.
... Shantijin! One request from me." - Shri Anandghanji, this soul, in which there is a goal, is called Pindastha Dhyana in the scriptures. The meditation of the soul residing in the physical body, the meditation of the soul-god residing in the body-temple, is Pindastha Dhyana. Where the mantra-sentences like Namaskara, which are indicative of the Supreme Being, are chanted, that is Padastah Dhyana. Where the omniscient Supreme Being, who is the subject of meditation, is the form-like meditation, that is Roopastha Dhyana. And
- Where the Nirangan, Nirakar Siddha Paramatma, who is beyond the body and form, is the subject of meditation, that is called Rupaatita Dhyana. *"देहादेवलि जो वसइ, देउ अणाइ अणतु । केवलणाणफुरंततणु, सो परमप्पु णिभंतु ॥"*
- Shri Yogindevdev-written Paramatmaprakash Ga. 33 In this, especially the meditation of the omniscient Bhagwan, who is the form-body-dwelling, is the ultimate benefit to the soul. Because seeing the unparalleled form of the Supreme Being, who is beyond the body, even though he has a body, the mind of the devotee becomes steady, leaving behind the Pindastha nature of the agile Lord. Therefore, that devotee sings in meditation and emotion: Oh Lord! If this form-like form had not been seen in the world, would our mind have been happy and joyful over it? Without being attracted, how would we desire the pure nature? Without being attracted, how would we desire the manifest form of the Lord? Without being attracted, how would we bring it to the state of meditation? Without being attracted, how would we taste the nectar? Therefore, we believe that Oh Lord! No devotee can attain liberation without your devotion. Oh Omniscient Supreme Being! By the gathering of our good virtues, you have become the form-body-wearer and have spoken the words of the nectar-like Dharma. Thus, Oh Lord! This form-body is the cause of many virtues, and by serving it, it becomes a shield against great fear, therefore, Oh Lord! We are determined to do this Pindastha Dhyana, becoming one. "Seeing the unique form, the good mind, having abandoned the agile nature, my mind becomes steady; if the form-like form had not been seen in the world, then what would the mind say, it would be hurting."

**Assembly Vision:** The importance of self-knowledge, the destruction of the land of passions.

Without violence, how can one desire pure nature? Without desire, how can your essence manifest? Without contemplation, how can you bring it into your state? Without experiencing its taste, how can you attain it? Without devotion, there is no liberation. Now, who is the devotee? Without form, there is no one. Now, who is the person? Through the yoga of true virtue, you have become form. We are equal to the divine, we have spoken of the Dharma. Therefore, your body, due to many virtues, is now the object of devotion, the great fearsome one. Peace-Victory-Wisdom-Disciple, tell the future generations! Meditate on the Lord's body, become one.
- Shri Rupavijayji.

"The meditation that is the same as the form, that is knowledge and conduct; by that, all sins go away, the meditator becomes the form of the object now." - Shri Yashovijayji.

This all-knowing Supreme Being, in whom the state of perfect peace, the immersion in the bliss of liberation, and the non-attached state are embodied, is also as beneficial for meditation as the Jinapratimā, which is the establishment of his form. The Jin and the Jinapratimā are both the same in terms of cause, as the scriptures say. Therefore, this established form of the Jinapratimā is like the Jin, and the oneness with it increases the manifestation of the qualities of the self's nature. And seeing this wonderful form of the embodied Lord, it is amazing that the noble people, the wise, desire the formless state! "The established Jin is the same in terms of cause, that is the word of the scriptures."

"The Jinapratimā is like the Jin, the sutras say." The oneness with the Jin, which is the same in essence, is the manifestation of the qualities of the self's nature. - Shri Devchandraji.

"Seeing this wonderful form, the wise desire the formless state; you have lost yourself, know this, O Dev! Remembering and worshipping it, the reader does good." - Shri Yashovijayji.

Similarly, the forms of the primordial gods, etc., also help the soul to attain its true form and elevate it to self-meditation. This self-meditation is the main means, because it fulfills the main purpose of the journey, it unites with the pure nature of liberation, and it leads to the yoga of seeking the pure self-essence. The meditator, the one who meditates, becomes the object of meditation, the Supreme Being. "By practicing karma yoga, the yogi who is absorbed in knowledge yoga, ascends to meditation yoga and attains liberation yoga." * "कर्मयोगं समभ्यस्य ज्ञानयोगसमाहितः । ध्यानयोगं समारुह्य मुक्तियोगं प्रपद्यते ।।"

There are many types of meditation in the Yoga perspective, but the best one is the meditation that focuses on the soul. This soul meditation is mostly not achieved without self-knowledge, and this self-knowledge is not attained without the true understanding of the soul. This true understanding is mostly achieved gradually by many beings, and the main path to it is the refuge, company, and respect for the knowledgeable person who is the embodiment of the soul. (See) Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter 342.
Disease and faults are destroyed "The meditator, the object of meditation, and samadhi are inseparable, leading to liberation." - Shri Devchandraji.
The seventh mental fault, "G", is destroyed here. Disease means the three faults of attachment, aversion, and delusion, which are the major forms of attachment and disease. Here, their absence is achieved. Or, any action performed without true understanding is a disease, because it destroys pure action. This means that the three faults cause suffering or damage to pure action, which is disease. (See Sanipat, p. 86) And the fruit of such diseased impure action is barren. (1)
Due to ignorance of the true nature of the soul, the being is confused and deluded - this is delusion. And due to this, the being develops attachment and aversion towards external objects because of the mistaken identification of the self with the body. Therefore, it moves towards external objects, engages in worldly activities. Thus, attachment and aversion are the greatest diseases for the being. Just as a person suffering from a severe illness loses consciousness, becomes delirious, and speaks nonsense, mistaking the self for the other and the other for the self, in short, behaves in a confused and contradictory manner, acting contrary to its original nature, and thus becomes a "sick person" by losing its true nature, similarly, when the three faults of attachment, aversion, and delusion affect a being, it loses awareness of its true nature, mistakes the external for the self and the self for the external, and speaks and acts in a confused and delirious manner, behaving contrary to its original nature. Thus, due to the three faults, the being falls away from its true nature, and its self-realization is disrupted, leading it to move towards external objects, engage in worldly activities, and find pleasure in them. This is the main disease for the being. (2) Or, any action performed without true understanding is also a disease, because it destroys pure action, that is, it causes suffering to pure action or disrupts it. Just as the actions of a sick person are diseased, so too are the actions of a person afflicted by these faults. The point is that any action that causes suffering to pure self-realization is a disease.

## The Essence of the Soul's Perfection - A Journey of Bliss

(567) The corruption of pure character, which is the form of the soul, is the disease. This is the essence of the discourse. Thus, the disease in the form of the soul's degeneration or the movement towards externalization is destroyed here. - This means that there is no movement towards externalization and the soul remains immersed in its own perfection. - In this "Prabha" vision, the state of being constantly immersed in pure self-perfection, avoiding the influence of external factors, is achieved. It embraces the pure, innate, self-divine, avoiding external influences and revealing the self-essence by immersing in the self-religion. This is the description of the experience of this high state of self-being:

"The mind becomes restless about other subjects besides self-perfection." "Here, the self-essence is realized." etc. (See) Shrimad Rajchandra.

"The perfection of the soul is a wonder, as if it is known, as if it is revealed." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

After the manifestation of the quality called "Sookshma Tatvavicharana" (subtle analysis of the essence) in the sixth vision, the quality called "Tatvamatipatti" (perfection of the soul) emerges as a natural consequence in the seventh vision. Tatvamatipatti is the experience of the self-essence as it is, in its true form. "The pure self is always experienced." Thus, here, the soul experiences direct perception - realization. Therefore, other scriptures that describe its aspects become irrelevant and useless, because scriptures only provide guidance on the path, and the main purpose of the scripture is to point towards the essence of the self, which is now experienced directly in realization. So, what is the use of it now? It has no purpose now.

"Who can describe the indescribable, unparalleled essence?
The innate, pure experience is the only word, all scriptures are a source of sorrow... Veer Jineshwar Parmeshwar Jaye.
As the mind and speech are indescribable, so is the form beyond the senses; the experience of the mirror of the individual power, the form of the hero is spoken." - Shri Anandghanji.

What is beyond the mind and speech, where speech and mind are silent, where there is no scope for alternatives - chanting, such a transcendental self-essence is directly perceived through the grace of the friend. What is not known through the deposit of knowledge, and where there is no spread of evidence, no movement, that pure form of Brahman is revealed only by the experience-light. (See p. 30)

Yoga-Dristi-Samuchaya
Dhyaan Mukhamasyaam Tu Jitamanmatha Sadhanam | Viveka Bal Nirjaatam Shama Saar Sadaiv Hi || 171 ||
Dhyaan-janya Sukh Eha Maan, Manmatha Ne Otnaar, Viveka Bal Thi Upjatam, Sadaiv Je Shama Saar, 171
Meaning:–And in this Dristi, there is a Dhyaan-janya Sukh that conquers the means of Manmatha (desire), which is born from Viveka Bal and is always Shama Saar (essence of peace).
Commentary
“Kaya Ni Visari Maya, Swaroope Shamaya Eva, Nigranth No Panth Bhavanant Ne Upay Che.” —Shreemad Rajchandraji.
In this presented seventh Dristi, there is only Dhyaan-janya Sukh. And what kind of special Sukh is it? It is such that it conquers the means of Manmatha – desire, meaning it conquers the objects of the senses like sound, etc. Moreover, it is born from Viveka Bal – the strength of knowledge, and is always Shama Saar – predominantly peaceful, because the fruit of Viveka is peace.
In this Dristi, the true Sukh of Dhyaan is experienced; the pure soul’s Dhyaan brings forth true, unadulterated bliss, which is felt here. Immersed in the ocean of nectar-like Nirvikalpa Dhyaan, the Giraj, who experiences the cool waves of bliss of the Dhyaan of his inherent nature, knows the indescribable Sukh of that experience himself. This Dhyaan-janya Sukh is the opposite of the Sukh born from objects. Because here, it is about conquering the objects of the senses like sound, etc., which are the means of desire.

The pleasure of the senses, even if it is caused by merit, is ultimately suffering. True happiness lies in the contemplation born of wisdom. (59) Victory is achieved, and the state of "Jinatva" is attained by conquering the senses. What is considered a source of happiness in the realm of words and other objects, when viewed from the perspective of ultimate truth, is actually a source of suffering, or merely an illusion of happiness. Because of the ripening of merit, deities attain exquisite sensual pleasures, but they do not experience natural happiness; instead, they experience natural suffering. This is because they are enslaved by the pain of their five-sense body, which is like a ghost, and they are drawn to and jump at objects that are pleasing to their minds, like a bird falling into a pit. They appear to be happy because of the accumulation of merit that makes them present at their will, but they are deeply attached to objects and experience the suffering of craving for them, like water in impure blood. Just as a thirsty person who desires to drink bad water suffers by consuming blood, so too do these meritorious beings, who crave and accumulate objects, suffer by experiencing destruction and the annihilation of their souls. Thus, even the merit that arises from good deeds is a source of suffering, which is merely an illusion of happiness. If the happiness of deities, who are highly meritorious, is ultimately suffering, then what can be said of other forms of happiness?

Furthermore, the sensual pleasure that arises from merit is not only an illusion of happiness but also a source of suffering in many ways. It is dependent, accompanied by bondage, fragmented, a cause of bondage, and uneven. Therefore, the pleasure that is obtained through the senses is actually suffering. Because it arises from external causes, which are separate from the soul, this sensual pleasure is dependent. It is accompanied by bondage because of the intense craving for objects, such as sounds, tastes, and so on. It is fragmented because it does not remain constant and unbroken, but is interrupted by the arising of pleasure and pain. It is a cause of bondage because the army of passions, such as attachment, follows it, and the heavy burden of karma accompanies it. It is uneven because it is constantly subject to increase and decrease. Thus, merit, like sin, is proven to be a source of suffering.

"Bound by attachment, accompanied by bondage, fragmented, a cause of bondage, and uneven. That which is obtained through the senses is indeed suffering." - Shri Kundakunda Acharya's Shri Pravachana Sara. And "Those who do not believe that there is no difference between merit and sin are like beings covered by a thick veil, wandering in the vast house of the world." - Shri Amrit Chandra Acharya's Pravachana Sara Commentary, verse 76.

For just as a chain made of iron or a chain made of leather are both chains and therefore a form of bondage, so too are the bonds of merit and the bonds of sin both bonds. 

Page #646:
---------------------------
(570)
The yogic perspective, which is the correct understanding of reality, is the only true bondage, meaning there is no real difference between merit and demerit. In other words, the happiness that is the result of merit is also just suffering, arising from karma. This happiness, born of merit, is suffering due to its consequence, its heat, its karmic imprint, and its opposition to the true nature of the soul. Just as the consequence of fattening a sheep destined for slaughter is extremely dreadful, and just as the water that quenches thirst ultimately leads to a terrible state, so too is the consequence of the enjoyment of worldly pleasures born of merit extremely dreadful. Where the senses are constantly burning with the heat of desire, fueled by the sun of worldly objects, what happiness can there be? Just as shifting a burden from one shoulder to another does not eliminate the pain, so too does indulging the senses not eliminate the suffering that is inherent in the soul. Happiness, suffering, and delusion are all opposed to the true nature of the soul, yet they are all forms of suffering.

A wise yogi, who has realized the true nature of worldly pleasures born of merit, understands their inherent suffering and is completely detached from them. Why would such a person indulge in these trivial pleasures? Why would they not conquer the objects of the senses, such as sound, touch, etc., which are the tools of Cupid (the god of love)? Why would they not completely abandon the accumulation of karma, which is like the dust of the world, as the Jinas (the enlightened ones) have done? Having tasted the nectar of the joy of meditation, which is the victory over the senses, why would they taste the foul-smelling objects of the senses, which are like a mere mouthful of tasteless food? Because worldly pleasures are dependent on external factors, while the joy of meditation is independent. Worldly pleasures are accompanied by bondage, while the joy of meditation is free from bondage. Worldly pleasures are fragmented and broken, while the joy of meditation is continuous and unbroken. Worldly pleasures are the cause of bondage, while the joy of meditation is the cause of liberation. Worldly pleasures are uneven, while the joy of meditation is even. Having attained this supreme joy of meditation, why would anyone even look at trivial worldly pleasures?

This joy of meditation arises from the strength of discrimination and the power of knowledge. The discrimination that arises from understanding the difference between the self and the non-self, and the knowledge of the self that is gained through this discrimination, are the source of this meditation. Just as the intensity of discrimination is like the sharpness of a sword, so too is the intensity of meditation. And just as the intensity of meditation gives rise to the joy of meditation, so too does it give rise to the intensity of the joy of the self. "If there is no attachment to the objects of the senses, then the world is like a dream." - Shri Pravachansar.

"There is no bondage, no liberation, no difference in the fruits of actions, except for the difference in dependence." - Shri Adhyatmasar, Atmanishchayadhyay, Sloka 60-74.

"Due to its consequence, its heat, its karmic imprint, and its opposition to the true nature of the soul, happiness born of merit is ultimately suffering." - Shri Adhyatmasar.

## Prabha Drishti: The Unity of Diverse Meanings of Shama - "Samajya Te Samaya"

(571) Just as a swan distinguishes between milk and water, separating the milk from the water and then consuming the milk, similarly, the Muni-like, supreme swan, the Yogi-raj, distinguishes between the Atma and Anatma, and recognizing the Anatma-like, all external influences as worthy of rejection, abandons them. He then recognizes the pure Atma-swaroop, filled with knowledge and vision, as the ultimate object of attainment and connects his mental activity to his Atma-swabhav. When the mental activity, in the form of contemplation, becomes still in this Atma-swaroop, that is primarily "G", and in Jain terminology, it is known as "Dhyan". This Shukal Dhyan-like, fiery flame burns away even the hard karma. Shukal Dhyan, a fiery flame, burns away the hard karma... leading to one's own happiness; the remaining nature is destroyed, becoming ashes, a powerful play... - Shri Devchandraji.

Thus, this Dhyan-sukh arises from Vivek-bal, the power of knowledge, and therefore it is always Shama-sar, Shama-predominant. Because "Samajya Te Samaya". The fruit of knowledge, that is, Vivek, is Virati-Shama. "Jnanastha Shreshtha Vitti" - this is the great sutra of the Jina-pravachan.

"Knowing the Atma-swaroop as it is, is called understanding. Therefore, when the use of other alternatives ceases, it is called Shama. In reality, there is only one. Understanding as it is, leads to Shama in the form of use, and the Atma becomes Atma-swabhav-maya. This is the meaning of the first sentence, "Samaji Ne Shamai Raheya". The attachment to other objects, which was considered to be the Atma, has ceased. This is the meaning of the second sentence, "Samaji Ne Samai Gaya". Whatever one understands, one abandons the "mine" and "yours", the ego and possessiveness, because one does not see any separate self-nature; and one's own nature is inconceivable, unobstructed, and purely one's own. Therefore, one merges into it." (See) - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrant 6. (651)

Thus, the mind of a Jnani Purush, who has attained Shama in his swaroop, is characterized by a peaceful flow. Just as the flow of a tranquil river, devoid of waves, continues uninterrupted, similarly, the flow of the Yogi's tranquil mind-river, this uninterrupted, peaceful flow, continues calmly, without any waves of alternatives arising. Because the distractions have been removed, there is a uniform flow, resulting in a state of equanimity. This peaceful flow arises from the impressions created by Nirodha. (For a detailed explanation, see page. Ye. Ru -10, and Dwa. Dwa. 24.)

"Tranquil flow, the world - Patanjali Yoga 2-10" 

Page #648:

(572)
The meaning of "Gadashtti Samuchaya Sham" is: (1) Cessation of passions, (2) Restraint, (3) Absence of attachment, (4) Equanimity, (5) Samya (similarity), (6) Dharma (righteousness), (7) Character, (8) Inner peace and tranquility.

Thus, the word "Sham" has one meaning, which is as follows: (1) Due to the various aspects of "Sham" in Vivek (discernment), one understands the true nature of things, the distinction between self and others is recognized, the unity of meaning is understood, and then one knows that everything other than the soul is foreign. Therefore, due to the object, the passions that are without cause do not arise, "rage, hatred, and purposelessness" do not arise, and anger, pride, deceit, and greed are pacified, peace is attained, and calmness is achieved. Thus, through Vivek, the passions are pacified. (2) Through Vivek, one knows the distinction between self and others, and then one is freed from the influence of others - one attains restraint. The mind's attachment to the object, which was like a clinging vine, ceases, it is restrained. Thus, the aphorism "The fruit of knowledge is restraint" becomes true. (3) When one knows the distinction between self and others, one is not confused by external things, one does not become attached, one does not get entangled. Therefore, attachment to external things is relinquished, attachment is released, and the bond of affection is broken. Thus, one attains the state of "Sham" in the form of absence of attachment. (4) When one attains the state of absence of attachment, one becomes free from attachment and aversion everywhere, and thus one becomes equanimous everywhere. One does not think of anything as desirable or undesirable, one becomes impartial, one considers "the worshiper and the critic as equal," etc. In this way, one attains equanimity. (5) When one attains equanimity, one attains Samya (similarity). To attain the same nature as the soul, to attain the same essence, is called Samya. Therefore, one attains Samya in the form of the state of the soul. (6) And when one attains Samya, one attains Dharma. Because Dharma is the nature of things. "Dharma is the nature of the soul." To attain the nature of the soul is called Dharma. Therefore, when one attains Samya in the form of the soul, one attains the Dharma of the soul. (7) When one attains the Dharma of the soul, one becomes virtuous. Because "to follow the nature of the soul is character." As the nature of the soul is known, as it is revealed, so too is the character, that is, the enjoyment of one's own nature, thus attained. (8) And our soul, which is one consciousness, is the best in relation to all others, as it is our own family, our own relatives. When this soul, which is our own family, is directly realized here, then supreme inner peace arises, and the soul rests in its own nature, it attains tranquility in its own nature, it merges into its own nature. This is what is meant by "Sham." "Towards the enemy and the friend, one should have the same attitude, in honor and dishonor, one should have the same nature, in life and death, one should not have any attachment, in the world and in liberation, one should have pure equanimity. When will such an opportunity come again?" - Shrimad Rajchandraji. Thus, when one knows the distinction between self and others - when one attains Vivek, then the passions are pacified, restraint is attained, attachment is gone, absence of attachment arises, equanimity arises, the nature of the soul is attained, and the attainment of the Dharma of the soul is achieved.

Prabha Dari: “All that is dependent is the characteristic of suffering”, “Having performed Pratikraman, he became free (573), the well-known conduct manifested, the soul reached the path of ultimate peace, calmed down in its own form, rested in its own form, understood its own form and merged into it. These are all the “types of calming down”. Or, in summary, they are all one.
Such an unprecedented calming down is attained here. That is why this meditation is called “Shamsar-Shampradhan”. Also -
“All that is dependent is suffering, all that is self-dependent is happiness. This is the characteristic of happiness and suffering in summary.” (172)
Meaning - All that is dependent is suffering, and all that is self-dependent is happiness. This is the characteristic of happiness and suffering in summary.
“All that is dependent is the characteristic of suffering, we obtain happiness that is self-dependent;
This is the manifestation of the inherent qualities of the soul, without it, what happiness can we call?” - Shri K. Sajay. 7-2
Whatever is dependent - subservient, is all suffering; and whatever is self-dependent - self-dependent, is all happiness; because it has the characteristic of happiness and suffering. This is the characteristic of happiness and suffering in summary, as the Muni has said.
Even in common parlance, it is said that “Hope in others is always disappointment”. There is no suffering like dependence - subservience, and no happiness like self-reliance - independence. If someone has fallen into despair due to hope in others, he alone knows the suffering of all that is dependent. The suffering of a dependent - subservient nation or people is evident, everyone knows this in the present times. Just as
in practice, so also in the ultimate reality, dependence - subservience is suffering, and self-reliance - independence is happiness. In the ultimate reality, dependence means being subservient to something other than the soul - something different, independence means being subservient to one's own soul - self-reliance. Where there is an expectation of an object, that object-based happiness is
Kritti - TRvaan Duv - All that is dependent is suffering, this is the characteristic of that, in all beings, all that is self-dependent is happiness - this is the purpose, Pataturan - this is what the Muni has said, Samen - in summary, Ksham - characteristic, form, Suvaduy - happiness - suffering.

Yogasthiti-Sushrutchay

We have already considered in detail that there is no happiness, but only sorrow, or perhaps only the appearance of happiness. The only true happiness is the absolute happiness of the self, which is the contemplation of a pure self-substance, because it is relatively powerless, but absolutely powerful. This is the definition of the Supreme Self.

“What is the use of hope? It is only knowledge that can improve things… Hope
wanders from door to door, like a dog, hoping for something… Hope
The servant of hope goes wherever it goes, and that person becomes a servant of the world… Hope.” —Shri Anandghanji

Or, the definition that anxiety is a sign of sorrow, and calmness is a sign of happiness, also fits with the previous definition and confirms it; because where there is more than one, where there is duality, there is anxiety; and where there is one pure, unmixed substance, where there is non-duality, there is calmness. Therefore, where there is dependence on the connection with the other, there is anxiety; and where there is anxiety, there is sorrow – this is the direct experience of everyone. And where there is independence, free from the connection with the other, there is calmness; and where there is calmness, there is happiness. This is also the direct experience of everyone. Thus, these two definitions are in harmony.

Anxiety is
Sorrow
4

The self has received endless suffering of worldly wandering due to the other, which is separate from the self. Just as a prisoner bound by chains is taken wherever he is to be taken, so too, the self, bound by the chains of the other, is dragged wherever it pleases, and is made to suffer endless sorrow of birth, old age, and death. Thus, the proverb “The other destroys” – “विटः ते विनाशं” – is true. The self has transgressed, trespassed, by violating its own time, that is, the limits of the form of the self-substance, and entering into the time of the other – the realm of the other’s matter – the other’s limits. From time immemorial, the self has interfered in the realm of the other’s matter, become attached to the other, and formed a bond of affection (!) with it. Therefore, the other’s matter, in return, has clung to the self like a hideous ghost, and has given the self a pledge to keep it within its own realm in return for the crime of invasion! Or, in return for the bond of affection, it has bound it with thick darkness and kept it in the prison of the world! Thus, dependence has led to this great suffering!

But when the self atones for the transgression of invading the other’s realm, and returns to its own…

**Prabha Drishti:** The virtuous eye sees both happiness and sorrow as transient, while the happiness of meditation is self-controlled. 
(575) It performs **pratikraman** (retraction) as a return to the field, and rejects going back to the other field. It remains balanced in its form and performs **samayik** (self-restraint) as its true nature. It performs true self-worship by touching its own form. It attains the supreme blessedness of self-praise, saying, "I bow to myself, I bow to myself!" It attains the path of the **Nigantha** (Jain ascetic), who has forgotten the body and is absorbed in its form, meaning it attains a state beyond the body while still having a body, and constantly practices **kayotsarga** (non-attachment to the body). Then this soul experiences the supreme happiness that is self-controlled. And this **yogi** (practitioner) who has attained this state of **karyotsarga** (action-restraint) abandons all objects of attachment, which are the source of sorrow, and takes refuge in the pure self-meditation, which is the source of happiness. Therefore, it constantly immerses itself in the waves of supreme bliss.

**SR**
Even the happiness that is desired for the sake of virtue is transient. Therefore, according to the nature of its characteristics, it is only sorrow. (173) 
Meaning: Even the happiness that is desired for the sake of virtue is transient, and therefore, according to the nature of its characteristics, it is only sorrow. (And the happiness that arises from meditation is the only true happiness.)

**Commentary:** According to the above-mentioned principle, the happiness that is desired for the sake of virtue is also transient, because virtue is external. Therefore, it is also only sorrow, according to the nature of its characteristics. Therefore, the happiness that arises from meditation is the only true happiness, because it is self-controlled and arises only from the detachment from karma.

The above-mentioned general principle states that whatever is transient is sorrow, and whatever is self-controlled is happiness. According to this principle, the happiness that is desired for the sake of virtue is transient, because virtue is external. Therefore, it is only sorrow, according to the nature of its characteristics. Therefore, the happiness that arises from meditation is the only true happiness, because it is self-controlled and arises only from the detachment from karma.

**Vritti:** Even the happiness that is desired for the sake of virtue is transient, because virtue is external. Therefore, it is only sorrow, according to the nature of its characteristics. Therefore, the happiness that arises from meditation is the only true happiness, because it is self-controlled and arises only from the detachment from karma.

**- Shri Adhyatma Saar**

(576)
The collection of yogic perspectives remains, meaning that whatever happiness is attained from the rise of merit, it is also happiness and suffering dependent on merit. Because that merit is also an external object, meaning that it is dependent on something else, that happiness which is dependent on it is that suffering itself. The characteristic of that suffering is obtained here.

The reason for calling merit an external object is that merit is auspicious action, and auspicious action is an external object, separate from the soul. Thus, from the rise of merit, which is in the form of an external object, whatever happiness is obtained by the gods, human kings, etc., is suffering from the ultimate perspective, or it is merely an appearance of happiness. The abundant wealth of Indra, Chakravarti, etc., and the so-called happiness obtained from the five senses related to it, is suffering itself. Here, the example presented in the story of the skilled pauper in the *Upamitibhavprapancha Katha* comes to mind, which clearly depicts the reality. In it, even those who have attained wealth from the rise of merit are called "skilled paupers," meaning those who are devoid of the wealth of dharma, and are said to be poor and miserable from the ultimate perspective. That entire wonderful allegorical description, like the great Siddhas, should be contemplated again and again by the liberated soul upon the soul of the father.

If one can consider bondage as happiness, then one can consider merit as happiness, but even a fool would not believe that. Because merit is the fetter of the army, and sin is the fetter of iron, but both are fetters. Whether a parrot is kept in a cage of the army or of iron, both are cages in the form of bondage. Therefore, whatever is dependent on karma, the bondage of the world continues. The thirst for objects remains.

The thirst for objects remains, how can it be called happiness? This has been discussed in detail above.

The essence of the above is that true, ultimate happiness arises only from meditation, because there is no dependence on anything else in self-meditation, or there is only dependence on the pure soul, the Supreme Soul, which is manifest. Therefore, the happiness of meditation is only dependent on the soul, and it arises only from the absence of karma. Being dependent on the soul, it is not subject to karma. Thus, in self-meditation, which is independent, the soul is the meditator, the object of meditation is the soul, and meditation is the soul. The trinity of meditator, meditation, and object of meditation becomes one here, the ultimate pure end is achieved. The inherent nature is the goal, the inherent nature is the means, and the inherent nature is the achievement. The non-dual unity is achieved here. Therefore, there is no agitation of any kind, no alternative form, ultimate non-dual peace is achieved, ultimate well-being arises, that is ultimate happiness, that is ultimate bliss. How can those who are attached to the trivial happiness of objects know about such supreme happiness of meditation? How can a villager understand the happiness of a city dweller? How can that happiness of meditation be described without experience?

"The happiness of the city dweller, the commoner does not know, the happiness of the beloved, the maiden does not know; without experience, the happiness of meditation, neither man nor woman can understand." - *Shri Saksha* 7-3

**Mamat: Nim Badhe Sada Abhyaan: Hem Sada Kalyana**
(577) “This *dhyaan* when it reaches its ultimate perfection, then the position of Indra is like a blade of grass to it. Self-illuminating, blissful, and free from delusion, this dhyaan is the destroyer of births. The doubt that was created by the intellect regarding the difference between the soul and the Supreme Soul, this dhyaan, in the form of a bridge, quickly removes it, and makes the two non-dual.

In the seventh Prabha Drishti of the Yogadrishti Suri, the knowledge is completely pure, the power of Kshapaksha has increased so much that the Mahatmas with this Drishti constantly meditate on the Muniśvaras. These Atmaram Jnanis, through Atmadhyan, are constantly immersed in Atmadhyan, such an amazing natural Atmaprapti Dhyanadsha is theirs because knowledge becomes meditation.
And here, for the Yogi, the knowledge-obscuring karma has been destroyed, the Satushraddhasangat Bedha has become clear and excellent, the knowledge has become so intense that such Yogishvaras naturally have constant, unbroken Atmadhyan. These Atmadhyani Purushas, "free from the desire for the objects of the world, and from the attachment to the soul, they remain established in Darshan-Jnana. And being free from all attachments, they meditate on the soul, not on karma or non-karma, and they contemplate the unity of the conscious, self-experiencing soul. Thus, the Jnanis, who are full of Darshan-Jnana and Ananyamaya, meditate on the soul and quickly attain the soul that is free from karma." In this achievement of Atmadhyan, the reliance on the Supreme Soul, who has attained the direct realization of the pure soul, is extremely beneficial. By the worship of the pure Atmaswaroop Paramatma, the pure soul is revealed, therefore, the Yogi Purushas constantly meditate on the Paramatma in the temple of their mind, because by the meditation on such a strong, supporting, Paramatma, the self-reliance becomes the reliance on the soul, and thus, by becoming one with the qualities of the "Devchandra" Paramatma, the soul reaches its full potential, attains the Paramatmapada.
"By the meditation on the strong, supporting Paramatma, the self-reliance becomes the reliance on the soul; by becoming one with the qualities of Devchandra, the soul reaches its full potential." My Lord, meditate on Him, meditate on Him,
Attain Siddhi, drink the nectar of experience." - Shri Devchandraji. Here, a well-known example is given: that which is almost completely purified, is known as "Kalyan" of gold, and it is always...
"The desire for the objects of the world is destroyed, and the soul meditates on itself. He who is free from all attachments, meditates on the soul, not on karma or non-karma, and he contemplates the unity of the conscious, self-experiencing soul. The Jnanis, who are full of Darshan-Jnana and Ananyamaya, meditate on the soul and quickly attain the soul that is free from karma." - Shri Samayasar Ga. 187-189.

## Assembly Vision: Asangaanushthan Sati Samavrittipad

(579) The form of "Kalyan" remains. Similarly, here too, due to the almost complete depletion of karma, the "Kalyan" has become like gold - it is swift and pure. The excellent "Kshapashram" which is bound by this, is itself the ultimate "Kalyan" because it becomes the goal of the ultimate "Kalyan" - the excellent, true knowledge. Just as a gem, free from impurities, continuously radiating light, truly shines and sparkles, so too, this pure, unblemished, true gem sparkles within, shining brightly. This ultimate luminous, radiant, "Dham" form is always the ultimate "Kalyan" because the attainment of the ultimate "Kalyan" - the "Maekshapad" - is very close here. Moreover, just as pure "Kalyan" gold never deteriorates, never changes, but remains as it is, in the form of "Kalyan", so too, pure "Kalyan" - the pure "Bodh" - never deteriorates, never changes, but remains as it is, in the form of pure "Kalyan". Therefore, it is truly said that this pure "Baadh" is constantly present here.

**Satpravrittipad** is here, "Asangaanushthan" is the name.
The journey on the great path, which leads to the "Nirvana" pad. (175)

**Meaning:** Here, in the "Tattvamarg", "Asangaanushthan" is the name given to the "Satpravrittipad" which is the journey on the great path, leading to the "Apuanaravarta" pad - the eternal pad.

**Analysis:** Here, in the "Tattvamarg", "Asangaanushthan" is the name given to the "Samavrittipad" which is attained. Because, in this way, there is "Swaraspravritti". This "Asangaanushthan" named "Satpravrittipad" is the journey on the great path, and it leads to the "Anaagami" pad, meaning it leads to the "Apuanaravarta" pad - the eternal pad.

What is the "Satyaavrittipad" mentioned above, in relation to "Asangaanushthan"? Its form is described here. Here, in the "Tattvavritti-Sanbavritti" chapter of the "Ved", and here, meaning in the "Tattvamarg", "Satpravritti" is what? It is "Asangaanushthan" - the name given to it, which is "AshaanWara" - "Asangaanushthan" - "Sanrit" - "Sanjna" - "Waala". Because, in this way, there is "Varaspravritti". "Mgruthya" 26 - this "Asangaanushthan" is the journey on the great path. "Mana[[naavan" - "Anaagami" padavah, (it leads to the "Apuanaravarta" pad), it is the "Nitya" pad - the "Praaptak" - the "Pamaadnak".

## Gidashtisamuchchay

In the path of yoga, which leads to the attainment of pure self-essence, the stage of active practice is called "Asanganushthan." The very name "Asanganushthan" reveals its nature, it is known and understood through proper perception, hence it is said to be "Asanganushthan as it is." "Sanjnachakta and Ruti Sanjna." What is this Asanganushthan? To understand it properly, one must know the nature of these four types of Anushthan: (1) Preet Anushthan, (2) Bhakti Anushthan, (3) Vachan Anushthan, (4) Asangan Anushthan.

The Anushthan where there is utmost respect and effort, where supreme love arises, and where everything else is abandoned, is called Preet Anushthan. * This Preet Anushthan, though similar, is more pure in its action due to the wisdom of reverence and devotion, this is Bhakti Anushthan. Therefore, even though the Anushthan is similar to Preet Anushthan in other ways, this Bhakti Anushthan has a special element of reverence, hence it is more pure in its action. To understand the nature of these two Anushthans, the example of a wife and a mother is given. A wife is extremely beloved, and a mother is benevolent. Whatever is given to a wife, like ornaments and clothes, is given out of love, and whatever is given to a mother is given out of devotion. This is the difference between the two.

The activity of a virtuous person, which is appropriate everywhere, following the purpose of the meaning, is Vachananushthan. In other words, the activity of a virtuous person, following the scriptural teachings, which is appropriate everywhere, following the scriptural teachings, the ideal conduct as per the scriptural teachings, is Vachananushthan. For example, a true sage or muni who follows the eighteen thousand rules of conduct, as per the scriptural teachings, is Vachananushthan. In practical life, whatever is independent of the scriptural teachings, where the expectation of the scriptural teachings is not there, and which has become like the fragrance of sandalwood due to very strong impressions, such action of the Jina, like the action of the Jina, like the action of the Jina, like the action of the Jina, like the action of the Jina, like the action of the Jina, like

## Prabha Drishti: Meeti Aadi 4 Anushthan, Anal Ban Chag (51)

**Atmaanucharan is Asangaanushthan.** It is said that: "What is performed as if it is one's own nature due to excessive practice by the virtuous, that Asangaanushthan is due to the impressions of the word." The first rotation of the wheel is due to the movement of the hand, and the subsequent rotation is due to the absence of the hand. This is an example that explains the difference between Vachanaanushthan and Asangaanushthan.

**Meaning:** Just as a wheel rotates when moved by hand, the initial rotations are due to the hand's movement. Later, even when the hand is removed, the wheel continues to rotate due to the previous impressions. Here, the initial rotations are truly Vachanaanushthan, and the subsequent rotations are truly Asangaanushthan.

Therefore, Vachanaanushthan related to begging, etc., is due to the action of the word, while Asangaanushthan is due to the impressions created by the word, even in the absence of the word, not due to the action of the word. However, due to the strong impressions of practice arising from it, it happens automatically.

Thus, Asangaanushthan is the practice that becomes ingrained in one's nature due to the deep impressions arising from excessive practice, without relying on the word in the course of action. It is like the fragrance of sandalwood permeating the entire forest, this practice becomes so much a part of the soul of the virtuous, that it pervades their entire being and fills them with the fragrance of virtue.

The soul has become so deeply ingrained with this practice, and the scriptures have left such deep impressions on it, that it spontaneously acts on its own, even without relying on the word. This natural, inherent practice of the great soul is Asangaanushthan.

**Analamban Chag**

It is called Analamban Chag because the form of Analamban Yag is as follows: Here, the reliance is also this - the supreme, both with form and without form, and the subtle, formless one is Analamban Chag.

"आलंबणं पि एयं रूवमरूवी य इत्थ परमुत्ति । तग्गुणपरिणइरूत्रो, सुहुमोऽणालंबगो नाम || "
—Shri Haribhadrasuri's Yagavishka, Ga. 19

"6 यत्त्वभ्यासातिशयात्सात्मभूतमिव चेष्ट्यते सद्भिः । तदसङ्गानुष्ठानं भवति त्वेतत्तदावेधात् ॥ चक्रभ्रमणं दण्डात्तदभावे चैव यत्परं भवति । वचनासङ्गानुष्ठानयोस्तु तज्ज्ञापकं ज्ञेयम् ।। "
Maharshi Haribhadracharya's Shodashak 10-7, 8.

This Asangaanushthan is the very sign of Analamban Sangatyag. One should know the form of Alamban Chag. It is the supreme, both with form and without form, and the subtle, formless one is Analamban Chag.

Here, **yoga-dristi-samuccaya** is of two types: (1) **Rupi** which means **samavasaranasthit** **jina-rupa** (the form of the Jina in the state of **samavasarana**) and its **alambana** (object of focus) which has characteristics like its image, etc. (2) **Arupi** **param** which means **siddha** **paramatma** (the liberated soul). In this, the **alambana** is the **arupi** **paramatma-rupa** (the form of the liberated soul) and the **yoga** is called **tad-guna-parinati-rupa** **analambana** (the yoga of the transformation of those qualities like **kevaljnana** etc. of the liberated soul) which is known through the transformation of those qualities. Due to its **atindriya** (beyond the senses) nature, it is **sukshma** (subtle); or this **yoga** is with a **sukshma** **alambana** (subtle object of focus), therefore it is called **ishad-u-kichit** **alambana-rupa** (slightly having an object of focus) and is called **analambana** **yoga**.

This **analambana** **yoga** is the **paratattva-darshanecchha-rupa** (desire to see the ultimate reality) which is attained in **samartha** **yoga**. "In the scriptures, the remedy is shown, but what is beyond the subject of the scriptures, is attained through special effort and strength, this **samartha** **paratattva** is called the supreme **yoga**." - This definition of **darshanecchha** was given in the beginning of this text (verse 5). This **samartha** **yoga** is attained in the second **apuurvakarana** (stage of purification) of the **kshapka** **shreni** (series of purifications) and in it, there is **sanyasa** (renunciation) of **kshama** (forgiveness) and other **kshapashmika** (purifying) **dharmas** (virtues). This **samartha** **yoga** which is in the form of **dharma-sanyasa** (renunciation of virtues) leads to the **nihsanga** (unattached) **paratattva-darshanecchha** (desire to see the ultimate reality) which is **akhand** (unbroken). Know this as **analambana** **yoga**. In other words, it is the desire to see the ultimate reality with **asanga** (unattached) power, which does not attach itself to anything else, does not choose anything, and is completely **akhand** (unbroken). This **analambana** **yoga** exists until the **paratattva** (ultimate reality) is seen. But when the **paramatma** (liberated soul) is seen, **kevaljnana** (omniscience) arises and **analambana** **yoga** is no longer **analambana** (without an object of focus) but becomes **salambana** (with an object of focus). The example of an arrow is used to understand this:

The **kshapka** (purification) is like the bow, arrow, and quiver. The **kshapka** **shreni** (series of purifications) is like the bow. The **paramatma** (liberated soul) is the target. The **analambana** **yoga** is like the arrow which is aimed at the target without missing. As long as the arrow is not released, **analambana** **yoga** is active. But when it is released, the target is hit only by its fall. Quickly, the **paramatma** (liberated soul) is seen. Therefore, the fall of the arrow is like the **salambana** (with an object of focus) **kevaljnana** (omniscience) light. * "The kingdom is not a denial: the grace is the **shey** (supreme)
**tin-padhyana** (threefold meditation) is the **havair-at-tattva-swar** (the essence of the true nature of the liberated soul)." - **Shodashaka** 14-1. "**Samartha** **yoga** is the desire to see the **tattva** (ultimate reality) with **asanga** (unattached) power. This is called **analambana** **yoga** until that vision is attained. Because it is established there and is truly active there. This **analambana** (without an object of focus) is called the best of all. Know that the vision of the **tattva** (ultimate reality) is like the arrow hitting the target. **Pat** (fall) is the **tattva** (ultimate reality) and **jnana** (knowledge) is the **chashvara-na-choti** (the peak of the liberated soul)." - **Shodashaka** 11-8, 9, 10.

## Prabha Drishti: The Essence of Asanga Anushthan

(583)

Not an Alanban Yaga Vyapar. Because the perfection of the flower is there. (Special inquisitive should observe the commentary of Shri Yashovijayji on Chaugvamshika and Shodashak Shastra.)

The essence of all this is: (1) Asanga Anushthan means, without the association of the scriptures, it is performed by the firm sanskar arising from it. It is the natural flow of the Nigranth Vitrag Muni, the Asanga conduct that has become the nature of the soul, this Nigranth Mahamuni's self-character is so ideal, that it does not have any kind of external influence. Sang is of two types: external and internal. Food and objects are external Sang, while attachment, aversion, pride, etc. are internal Sang. Where there is a complete absence of both these types of Sang, it is called Asanga Anushthan. Where there is complete perfection of the Nigranth nature of matter and spirit, and especially the ideal spirit, it is Asanga Anushthan. (2) This Asanga Anushthan is the same as Alanban Chaug. To attain oneness with the qualities of the formless Supreme Soul, to attain the state of harmony, is Alanban Yaga. Without any attachment to anything else, just focusing the mind on the Supreme Soul, becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the oneness of the qualities of the Supreme Soul and the soul, is Alanban Yaga, which is Asanga Anushthan. (3) And this Alanban Chaug is the intense desire for the vision of the Supreme Soul, which manifests in Samathyaag. This desire for the vision of the Supreme Soul is so intense that there is no attachment to any other influence, the mind does not wander anywhere else, only the thirst for the vision of the Supreme Soul remains. Thus, without any association, attachment, dependence, or obstruction, the Asanga Nigranth conduct that takes place, the Alanban Yaga that manifests in the form of meditation on the Supreme Soul, the intense desire for the vision of the Supreme Soul that prevails, all this is Asanga Anushthan.

The essence of Asanga

It is necessary to understand the mystery of the word 'Anushthan'. To perform an action that is in accordance with knowledge, that is conducive, and that is not contradictory, is called Anushthan. So, just as it was firmly decided that the soul is different from the body and other external objects, to put this decisive knowledge into practice, to renounce the feelings of attachment, etc. towards the body and other external objects, and to strive for the attainment of the pure soul, is Anushthan. The experience of the soul, which is different from the body and other external objects, the self-knowledge that is attained, to perform the conduct of the pure soul nature, free from the association of the body and other external objects, in accordance with it, is Anushthan. Such an action, which is so beneficial, is also known as Anushthan. By performing the practice of Amrit Anushthan, which leads the soul to the state of Amrit,

The yogi who has attained Samyak Darshan, free from all external influences and attachments, attains the state of supreme, nectar-like self-contemplation.
"With love and devotion, practice...mind, speech, and action, free from attachment...the devotee, immersed in the divine, experiences...the mind, naturally filled with devotion to the Lord...future." - Shri Devchandraji.
This supreme, nectar-like, detached practice is the journey on the great path, the direct path to the great liberation, the final destination. This detached practice is the direct attainment of liberation. And that is why this detached practice is called "Anagami Pada Avaha" here, meaning the non-returning state, the eternal state, the state of eternal liberation, which it brings about. Through this detached practice, one attains the eternal, ever-stable state of liberation. Because this detached practice, as mentioned above, is the state of non-dependence, the state of complete immersion in the divine, and through the contemplation of the divine form, the soul inevitably becomes the divine, just as a caterpillar becomes a butterfly through contemplation of the butterfly. "The mind, filled with devotion to the Jina, is filled with love, penetrating essence, and virtue. Future."
"The devotee will attain the Jina's state, mind, like the essence of nectar. Future." - Shri Devchandraji. "He who becomes the Jina and worships the Jina, he is truly a Jina. He who is attracted to the beauty of the world, is like a fly attracted to dung." - Shri Anandghanji. This is called
"Prashantavahitasanjham Visbhagaparikshayah. Shivavartma Dhruvadhveti Yogibhirgiyate Hyadah." 176. Visbhagaparikshay and, the name Shantavahitam,
The Shivapath, the Dhruvamarg, this song is sung by the yogis, thus, 106, meaning - This detached practice, known as Prashantavahitasanjna, is Visbhagaparikshay, Shivavarma, Dhruvamarg, and is sung by the yogis.
Discussion "Visbhagapkshay Shantavahit, Dhruvamarg Shiv Naam;
The yogi performs detached action here, the result is pure fame." - A. Sakza, - P. Krutti - Kaftavaataavanshaprashantavahitasantavala, - Sankhyanu. Vimaan Pariksha: - Vibhagaparikshay, Buddhist. Shivavarma - Shivavarma, Shivmarg - Shonu - Dhruvadhya - Dhruvamarg - Mahavatinu, Krutti - Thus,
Jimirjay? Yes - Detached practice is sung by the yogis.

The assembly, on the name of Asanga Anushthan, is peaceful and infinite, blissful.
(585) This Asanga Anushthan, which has been mentioned, has been sung by the Yegis with different names. Some call it Prasanta Vahitha, some call it Vibhag Pariksha, some call it Shiv Varma, and some call it Dhruv Mag.
(1) The Sankhya Dasni-Gadasni call this Asanga Anushthan by the name Prasanta Vahitha. Where Prasanta-extremely peaceful Vahitha-carrying feeling is, that is, where the unbroken peaceful Sudharas flows continuously, that is Prasanta Vahitha Asanga Anushthan. Where the unbroken Atma sthiti rup Param Prasanta Chaitanya Rasa Amrit Sagar, various names are immersed, unbroken, continuous Atma bhav pravah flows, that is Prasanta Vahitha. (2) The Bauddha Dasni call it "Visabhag Pariksha". Where there is a test of division, that is Visabhag Pariksha. This is understood as follows: where there is a complete destruction of the Anadi Kuvasnamay Visha, that is Visabhag Pariksha. When this Kuvasnamay Visha is completely destroyed, the Param Amrit Swarup Atma naturally manifests, that is Visabhag Pariksha. (3) It is called Shiv Varma-Shiv Marg. Shiv means the supreme principle, the ultimate good or liberation; the path to attain it, the path leading to it, that is Shiv Varma, Shiv Marg, Moksha Marg. Or Shiv means peace, the path to attain supreme Atma Shanti, that is Shiv Vak. (4) The Mahavratik calls it Yuva Adhvaprav Marg. Dhruv means that which never moves, never changes, in all three times. Just as the Dhruv star never moves, never changes, it remains Dhruv, so that which never moves, never changes, remains Dhruv, that is Dhruv Pad. The path to go to that Dhruv Pad is Dhruv Marg.
Thus, the Asanga Atma Charitra, which is the supreme Vitrag Bhav, which is known as Asanga Anushthan, has been sung by other Darshanis with different names, and its greatness has been expanded. And thus, even the Paramanu Matra is free from the touch of the desire of Parbhav-Vibhav, this supreme Asanga Vitrag Pad-Jin Pad, Shiv Pad, Buddha Pad, Vishnu Pad; and the path to attain it is also the same Asanga Anushthan. The supreme secret of all the paths, "This is what the Yogi knows", the supreme wonderful immortal poem, which is the Gishwar * Kanta Vahitha: Sansthanikolasan
Pradurabhavatiroma thi Tadgulyanagochham | "—Dha. Tha, 24, 25. That is, Prasanta Vahitha means the result of the continuous flow of Sadpravah, without interruption. That Vritti means the Vrittimay Chitta, free from the influence of Nirodhajan and Vyatyajan. "Tatha Vatavadita Samvat - (A. 20-10). What is this Nirodha? It is the Nirodhajan and Vyatyajan, the emergence and disappearance of the Sanskar, in order.

Gadasti Samuchaya is the final work of Shrimad Rajchandraji. In this final chapter, all the above-mentioned names are beautifully woven together in a simple and clear style, with a profound meaning. 
“Sukhdham anant susant chahi,
Dinrat rehe tad dhyan mahi; par shanti anant sudhamay je,
Pranamum pad te, var te, jay te.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji. 
The saints and yogis desire this supreme abode, which is infinite, eternal, and unchanging. They constantly desire it, and therefore they remain in its contemplation day and night. This abode, where supreme peace flows, is filled with nectar. Salutations to this abode! This abode is a “var” (blessing), meaning it is chosen and desired by the yogis. This abode is the ultimate (Choicest) and victorious! Here, the word “sudhamay je” (filled with nectar) indicates its auspiciousness, and the word “anant” (infinite) indicates its unchanging nature. The word “sudhamay” suggests the examination of the different parts, and the phrase “par shanti anant” (supreme peace infinite) demonstrates the state of tranquility. Thus, in a single stanza, all the yogic scriptures are perfectly aligned with the ultimate definition of yoga, revealing the profound secret of the ultimate truth with unparalleled simplicity! Indeed, Shrimad’s final words are the final words of all yogic scriptures.
एतत्प्रसाधयत्याशु यद्योग्यस्यां व्यवस्थितः । एतत्पदावहैयैव तत्तत्रैतद्विदां मता ॥ १७७ ॥ Eh prasadhe shigh ahim sthit gijan shi; tethi eh-padavaha, aa j tattane it. 177
Meaning – Because the established saint yogi in this vision quickly achieves this unattached practice. Therefore, this vision, which bestows this abode, is the most desired by those who know this abode.
Commentary – This vision quickly achieves this unattached practice because the established saint yogi is in this vision. Therefore, this vision, which bestows this abode, is the most desired by those who know this abode.

The Prabha Drishti, the attainment of Asanga Anushthana, is the ultimate goal, the supreme blessing, victory! (587) This Drishti, which leads to the Asanga Pad, is considered the ultimate goal by the wise, the enlightened ones, who know this path. 

This Asanga Anushthana, which is mentioned here, is attained in the seventh Prabha Drishti, leading to swift liberation. Here, the Yogi, with a pure, detached state of mind, attains this Asanga Pad, where the endless cycle of karma is transcended. Through the process of purification and detachment, the soul, in its pure, eternal form, manifests as the inherent state of liberation. Here, the soul continuously immerses itself in the ocean of pure, blissful consciousness, where the flow of peace and tranquility is uninterrupted. It is here that the Yogi experiences the ultimate truth, the unity of knowledge, vision, and conduct, leading to liberation, the path to Shiva. The Yogi attains the direct path to the ultimate goal, the eternal state of liberation.

"By conquering the ego, the Yogi attains a state of pure detachment, where the mind is free from all attachments." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. The state of such a detached Yogi is truly extraordinary. The soul is indifferent to everything, dwelling only in the state of detachment. The Yogi does not identify with anything other than the pure, radiant soul. This extraordinary state of detachment and indifference is a prime example of the teachings of Shrimad Rajchandraji.

"The mind remains in a state of pure consciousness." The Yogi is free from all desires, attachments, and worldly pursuits. They have no interest in material possessions, no desire to achieve anything, and are unaware of the world's affairs. They do not differentiate between friends and enemies, and are barely aware of their own physical body.

And so on. See Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 217 (25). This Asanga Anushthana is attained in the seventh Drishti, making it the ultimate path to liberation, the most cherished goal of the Yogis. This is because it leads to the eternal state, the ultimate goal, the Asanga Anushthana, the state of pure activity. Those who know this state in its true form, are blessed with eternal happiness, victory, and the glory of the soul, the state of liberation.

For the expert yogis who have mastered the collection of insights, this vision that grants them direct realization of that state is supremely beloved, extremely dear, what wonder in that? Therefore, the yogi constantly yearns for this vision, constantly holds a devotional desire, and praises the wise one who is endowed with such unattached knowledge:
“Even though he has a body, his state is beyond the body; at the feet of that knower, O countless salutations.” —Shri Atmasiddhi
: Essence of the Prabha Dristi: The seventh Prabha Dristi is beloved of meditation. Therefore, in this, the seventh citta-dosha named “roga” is not present, and this vision is endowed with the seventh guna named tattva-pratipatti, and especially is united with shama, and is the one that grants the sat-pravritti-pada, the path of right action.
In this vision, there is meditation-born happiness, which conquers the objects of desire such as words, etc., and is born from viveka-bala, the power of knowledge, and is always united with shama, because the fruit of viveka is shama. Similarly, all that is dependent is suffering, and all that is self-dependent is happiness. In brief, the Muni has described the characteristics of happiness and suffering. Even happiness that expects punya is dependent, because punya is external, and therefore, this happiness that expects punya is suffering due to the attainment of its characteristics. Only meditation-born happiness is the true happiness, because it is independent, and is born only from karma-viyoga. Here, because the bond is pure, the great Munis always have meditation, because that which is almost free from defilement is always auspicious.
The sat-pravritti-pada, known by the name asanga-anushtana, is attained here. It is the path of the great path, and is the one that grants the eternal state. This asanga-anushtana is sung by the yogis by many names: prashanta-vahitta, vibhaga-parikshaya, shiva-varma, dhruva-bhaga; the yogi who is situated here quickly attains this. Therefore, this vision that grants this state is beloved of the yogi.

## Prabha Drishti: Essence, Prabha Drishti's Kalash Kavya
(589)
Kalash Kavya

Malini Dinakar, what light does this Prabha named Drishti illuminate, a torrential downpour of the nectar of peace, pure perception, the essence of the truth, free from disease, making all pure forever. 135
The subject of happiness, the means of conquering all, born from the knowledge of the difference between self and others, the essence of peace, the happiness of meditation, what kind of yogic strength is experienced here? 136
Everything is under the control of the mind, knowing the pain, everything is under the control of the self, happiness according to that, the sign of happiness and sorrow, in short, happiness is dependent on flowers, sorrow is here. 137
Pure, the soul's sharp meditation everywhere, day and night, this is the place for the great wise, the impurities are melted, the auspiciousness of gold is examined, the wise say, "Here is the true auspiciousness of meditation." 138
Where the poison of the world, the poison of the senses, is exhausted, where the activity of the non-returning path prevails, where the stream of peace, the nectar of peace, flows, the yogi is always pleased with the path of Shiva, the path of the eternal. 139
Where there is no change, no association, where time does not touch the self, where time does not exist, where there is no activity of the mind, the state is in its own time, the activity of the true non-attached. 140
The path of true activity, where there is non-attachment, the great path, the yogi's journey, the separation of the world, the peace of the mind, the path of Shiva, the eternal part, is sung. 141
The whole place is non-attached, this non-attached practice, the yogi practices here, this place, day and night, the mind's joy of the self, the servant of the Lord, quickly attains the path. 142

|| Thus, in the Kiratchandra Sunu Manah Sukhanandana, composed by the great sage Haribhadracharya, the great sage Bhagavan Das, with the commentary of Sumanonandani Brihattika, with the explanation of the Makavivechana, in the seventh chapter of the Sri Yogadrishti Samuccaya Shastra, Kamadrishti ||

## The Seventh Insight, Para Darsti

The seventh insight is called Para Darsti, and now the eighth is described. It says:

**"Samadhi-nishtha tu para tad-asanga-vivarjita | Satmikrita-pravritti cha tad-uttirna-ashayiti cha || 178 ||"**

**Translation:** The eighth insight, Para Darsti, is established in samadhi and free from its attachments. It is characterized by self-realized activity and an aspiration that transcends it.

**Commentary:**

The eighth insight is called Para Darsti, and its name "Para" is truly fitting, as there is nothing beyond it. It is the ultimate, the most excellent.

The eighth insight, Para Darsti, is established in samadhi. Samadhi is a special state of compassion or the fruit of meditation.

It is free from the attachments of samadhi. It is characterized by self-realized activity, like the fragrance of sandalwood. It has an aspiration that transcends activity, like the absence of a desire in a liberated mind. 

Page #667:
---------------------------
## The Eighth Insight: The Moon-Like Samadhi

"Par" Insight: This insight is called "Par" because it is the highest and the ultimate. Here, the spiritual development culminates, reaching its final peak. The ultimate principle is directly active here, meaning the soul directly becomes the Supreme Soul. Moreover, the one who attains this "Par" insight transcends the world, hence it is also called "Para." This eighth insight, as described above, has two characteristics like the moon, the eighth limb of yoga, Samadhi, the eighth restraint, the abandonment of the eight types of attachment, and the attainment of the eighth virtue.

In this insight, the two characteristics are like the moon because this eighth insight has more restraint than the seventh insight, which is like the sun, the all-illuminating Sun-like insight. The sun's light is bright but gives heat, while the moon's light is intense but cool and calming, providing ultimate bliss. Both illuminate the world equally, but the moon's light is considered superior to the sun's. Thus, this insight, like the full moon, is fully illuminated by the full moon of knowledge, and its restraint is fully absorbed in the Supreme Soul. This moon of knowledge illuminates the entire world but does not become the world itself. (See pages 757-487)

This "Par" insight is aptly compared to the moon because, like the moon, it remains stable in its form, illuminating the world with knowledge but not encompassing it. It is inherently complete in its activity, with no room for external influence. It is a pure, unadulterated, non-dual state.

Since this insight reaches the peak of restraint, it attains the eighth limb of yoga, Samadhi. This insight is rooted in Samadhi, always remaining in the form of the right path. Others call this state "Samadhi-nishedh" (rooted in Samadhi) because it is a special kind of meditation or the fruit of meditation. Holding the mind in restraint, the unity of conviction, that is meditation, and that meditation, being only the form of the object, is considered formless, that is Samadhi. In other words, where only the object is seen and the form of meditation remains absent, and where the triad of meditator, meditation, and object merges into one, only the inherent self-nature shines in its natural form, that is called Samadhi. Here, this supreme self-Samadhi continuously prevails, so the yogi who dwells in this insight remains in an unbroken state, as the Supreme Self, because all external influence has completely vanished. 

Page #668:
---------------------------

**Gadarisaaruchchaya** means to exist in the state of spontaneous, effortless playfulness, solely in the form of the Self, with the purest, non-dualistic feeling. Thus, this vision attains the ultimate state of steadfastness in samadhi, which is why it is called "samadhinishtha" here.
"When one enjoys one's own pure, effortless nature, and there is no protection in the field of the Self; a single, helpless, selfless, steadfastness, the power of enthusiasm is present in all manifestations." - Shri Devchandraji.
This supreme, **sadhyana**-like **atmasamadhi** is **nivikalpa** (without any mental modifications), because, as mentioned above, everything is pure and **nivikalpa** like the moon. Therefore, it is a **nivikalpa** state where no kind of mental modification can arise at all. Thus, there is **nivikalpa**, undivided **atmasamadhi** here, meaning the meditator, meditation, and the object of meditation, all three distinctions disappear. The triad of knower, knowledge, and the known also merges. Knowledge, vision, and conduct, these three qualities also merge into one, non-dualistic, Self-nature. Here, all dualistic feelings cease to exist, and a pure Self-nature remains established. It conducts itself as a pure, knowledge-vision-filled Self-nature, with fixed conduct and character, and blossoms in its own nature.
"In **nivikalpa** samadhi, the three qualities are non-dual." "The meditator, the object of meditation, and samadhi are non-dual, they merge into each other without separation; the meditator's effort and feeling are eliminated, the object of meditation is realized." - Shri Devchandraji. "When those three merge into non-duality, then that Self-nature...the original path. The one who attains that path, attains their own true nature...the origin." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
This supreme **gidd** (spiritual intoxication) attains this **nivikalpa** state through such undivided Self-meditation.
"I am different from everything in every way, I am a single, pure, conscious form, supremely excellent, inconceivable, blissful form, I am only a solitary, pure experience. Is there any disturbance? Any mental modification? Any fear? Any regret? Any other state? Pure, pure, excellent, pure, supremely peaceful consciousness, I am only **nivikalpa**. I use my own nature. I become absorbed. Peace! Peace! Peace!"
Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter 760 (833) Thus, those **gishvars** (liberated souls) who have transcended the web of mental modifications, have a peaceful mind, have abandoned partiality towards any path, and have become absorbed in their eternal nature, they are the ones who truly drink the nectar. In other words, those who meditate on this pure, **shukla** (bright) Self-meditation, they are the ones who attain the supreme...

On the breath leaving, the soul drinks the nectar of its own form.
(493) The soul experiences the direct nectar-like taste of the innate samadhi bliss, which is the supreme nectar in the form of the eight stages of liberation of the self-hidden soul. In the same way, the crest-jewel of the ascetics, Shri Amritchandraji, has expressed this supreme self-awareness in the overflowing joy of the Shri Samayasar Kalash:
“Those who, having abandoned the bias of the path, dwell eternally in the self-hidden form, their minds freed from the net of alternatives, they alone drink the nectar directly.”
In this eighth vision, where such supreme self-samadhi manifests, the eighth mental defect called fire is completely abandoned. Attachment to a particular action due to the color that is applied to that place, that is, attachment to that action itself, is the defect of attachment. The action that is being performed, the feeling that “this is beautiful,” “this is ugly,” “this is good,” whatever color is applied, whatever feeling of attachment arises, to remain stuck in that, to be entangled in that, is attachment. Because, if the soul remains attached to a single place, it remains stuck there, it does not progress, it does not advance, it does not touch the next stage of virtue, and therefore does not attain the success, the liberation, which is the ultimate goal. (See page 86).
“Like the fragrance of sandalwood, forgiveness is not appreciated here; attachment is forbidden here, action is attributed to its own virtue.” — Sajja 8-2
Or, attachment arising in the context of matter and its influence is attachment. This vision-possessing, dispassionate, great yogi has no attachment, even in the slightest, to the atoms of matter and its influence, not even in dreams, not even for a moment, does he develop a sense of self towards them; because, except for the pure soul, even an atom is not different, he has this unbroken self-awareness. Why would such a supremely self-aware soul have attachment to influence? Indeed, attachment elsewhere is far away, but as mentioned above, even in the action of yoga-samadhi, he does not have attachment! And therefore, this yogi-lord, attaining higher and higher stages of samadhi, progresses, attaining higher and higher stages of virtue; he does not remain stuck in a single place, but constantly increases his infinite restraint, and climbing the ladder of stages of virtue, he attains the exalted state of self-samadhi.
“Gradually, restraint touches the soul, the acquired perishable feeling; the series of restraints destroys the whole, it worships the state of liberation.” — Shri Yashovijayji

After the Gadashti Sanjeeer T and the seventh Prathipatti-Tatvanubhav-रूप (form) Guna (quality) manifest, naturally, in this eighth Dristi (perspective), the eighth Pravritti Guna (quality of activity) manifests, so that the activity is in accordance with the truth. That is, *
Just as the form of the pure Atma-Tattva (soul-essence) is experienced, in the same way, the state of activity, conduct, and character, which is inherent in oneself, prevails. The activity is fulfilled by the soul's own nature. In other words, the nature of the soul is knowledge-vision, and in that nature,
there is a fixed character, to act fully in the nature of the soul, to fulfill the activity of one's own nature, this excellent quality of activity manifests here. Thus, this natural activity becomes one with the soul, the activity guided by the soul becomes soul-like.
It becomes the soul itself. The soul itself becomes the embodiment of character, the region of character, by the name of the soul, is filled with pure character qualities. Just as sandalwood, which does not need to be perfumed by anyone, spreads its fragrance everywhere in the forest, so this form-based, soul-activity quality naturally spreads throughout the entire region of the soul, filling it with the complete fragrance of good conduct. As this quality of activity develops, the desire for worldly things diminishes, and the amount of detachment increases, ultimately revealing the well-known supreme detached character. That is, just as the pure form of the soul is known, or as the pure, unblemished form of character is known, as the wise have spoken, it manifests here.
As such a perception is the ray of the soul, distinct from all, unattached; the original path
that stable nature which produces, the character by name, that unattached original”—Shrimad Rajchandraji.
Moreover, this Dristi (perspective) is elevated from activity, due to the absence of the Vasak (desire) mind. That is, now the mind-intention is elevated from activity, it has crossed over. The mind
has nothing left to do, so its entire activity, the activity of cessation, ends, all running around stops, and it merges into the soul. Previously, all the activity of the soul, which is free from desires, was done through the mind,
as long as there was even a trace of desire, the mind, filled with desire, was running all the affairs of the soul. But now, when that desire-like affliction is eradicated, when the seed of desire is completely burned, the soul itself acts in its own form, there is no interference from the mind (agent) in between. Thus, like a deposed minister, the mind filled with desire is expelled here! Therefore, “Schittvrittinidhah” the complete attainment of the yoga of cessation of mental activity is achieved here.
All regions manifest with all qualities, activity is infinite, O free from desires; with the service of the supreme quality, the servant, the lack of respect is removed”—Shri Devchandraji.

**On the Eighth Insight:**

"Activity is fulfilled by its own nature,
(55) The mind, attached to the world, is full of afflictions, while the mind free from afflictions is the end of rebirth." - Shri Yashovijayji.

"Where there is attachment and aversion, there is always affliction for the mind. Where there is indifference, there is the destruction of all suffering.
"Just as the shadow disappears in the vast expanse, so too does the mind's nature disappear in its own form." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

**The State of Nirāchāra:**

"Nirāchāra is here, free from all transgressions.
The effort is like the movement of one who has reached the summit and has no need to climb further." (179)

**Commentary:**

In this insight, the yogi is in the state of Nirāchāra, free from all transgressions. He has no desire to perform any actions, and therefore lacks the need for Pratikramaṇa and other rituals. He is also free from all transgressions, as he has no reason to commit any. His effort is like the movement of one who has reached the summit and has no need to climb further, because he has no karmas left to conquer through actions. He has transcended all actions and attained the state of Nirāchāra.

"The yogi in this state of Nirāchāra, is not to be called a transgressor. His movement is like that of one who has reached the summit of a mountain." - D. Sazā. 8-1.

When the yogi attains this eighth insight, he no longer needs to perform any actions. He is liberated from all actions. Until now, the yogi in the state of Nirāchāra has been free from actions, but in this insight, he is completely free from all restrictions. His effort is like the movement of one who has reached the summit and has no need to climb further. He is free from all karmas that can be conquered through actions, and has attained the state of Nirāchāra.

(56)
The practices and principles that were essential for the practice of yoga, which were necessary and non-material, now become useless when complete yogic attainment is achieved. This is because the yogi is liberated from the need for them. The practices like Pratikramana, which were helpful for the initial practitioner to climb the ladder of spiritual progress, become useless for the yogi who has attained the state of Samadhi. The practices like Pratikramana, which are like nectar in the initial stage, become poisonous if clung to in the state of yogic attainment. This is because they disrupt the state of unbroken self-realization. The purpose of practices like Pratikramana is to attain the state of self-realization. Once this purpose is achieved, these practices become useless.

There may be a doubt: "What about pure self-contemplation? Because it is through Pratikramana that the soul becomes free from guilt. Not practicing Pratikramana is like not removing guilt, making it poisonous. And practicing Pratikramana is like removing guilt, making it nectar."

The resolution: Why is Pratikramana poisonous? There are three types of non-Pratikramana: (1) The non-Pratikramana of the ignorant is poisonous. This is because it lacks pure self-realization and is itself a form of guilt. (2) The non-Pratikramana that is not aimed at the third stage of pure self-realization is also poisonous. This is because it does not serve the purpose of the soul and works against the purpose of the mind, thus becoming poison for the soul. (3) The non-Pratikramana of the enlightened, which is aimed at the third stage of pure self-realization, is itself nectar. It directly leads the soul to nectar.

Therefore, for the enlightened who have attained pure self-realization, practices like Pratikramana are poisonous, and non-Pratikramana is nectar. (Compare: Poisonous and nectarous practices).

•"Paddicamanam paddisaranam pariharao dharana niyattee ya | jinda garha sohi atthaviho hoi visakumbho || appaddicamanam appaddisaranam appariharo adharana ceva |
aniyattee va aninda garha sohi amayakumbho ||" (See) Samayasara Ga. 301-307 and the extremely wonderful commentary of Amritchandracharya. 

Page #673:
---------------------------
On the other hand, in this state of complete detachment, the situation of the Siddha Yogi, the Knower, is different. (597) And for this very reason, because this Siddha Yogi, the Knower, has attained the third stage, which is like the Amrit Kalash (pot of nectar) and is non-retrogressive, they do not have any practices like material repentance, etc., which are useful for seekers. It is non-retrogressive because the ultimate goal of all actions is the pure self-realization, which is like the Amrit Kalash, and this realization of the pure self has already been attained here. Therefore, there is nothing left to be achieved. Because, “Repentance is that which turns the soul back from the many extensive and specific good and bad actions that have been done in the past.” Or, “Repentance is the return to the original place of one who has gone to another place due to being overpowered by delusion from his own place.” In other words, repentance is the return to the original pure state of the self from the state of corruption. This kind of return to the pure innate self-nature, which is the ultimate goal of repentance, has already been attained here. Therefore, they have manifested a state of complete innocence and purity, where even the slightest transgression is impossible. Then, where is the scope for repentance, which is the atonement for transgression? Thus, they attain the state of non-retrogression, which is the ultimate state of pure self-nature and the state of being like the Amrit Kalash. The same applies to the matter of non-rejection, etc.

Here, this example is given: To climb a mountain, one has to perform the action of climbing, but once one has reached the top of the mountain, there is no need to climb anymore. Similarly, to climb the mountain of Yoga, one has to perform the action of climbing, which is the gradual crossing of the stages of Yoga, but once one has reached the peak of the mountain of Yoga, there is no need to perform any action of climbing, which is the practice of Yoga.

The means of support and practice that are essential and unavoidable for the seeker, who is still in the process of seeking, are not needed at all for the Knower, who has attained the state of realization. Because, what is the need for climbing for one who has already climbed? What is the need for attaining for one who has already attained? What is the need for eating for one who has already been fed? Thus, the situation of the Knower of Yoga, who has attained the ultimate state of self-absorption and ultimate knowledge, is different. Why should the law apply to the ordinary people? Why should they be subject to the speculations of the ordinary people? And why should the ordinary people be able to imitate such Knowers? What is the use of offering food to one who is not hungry?

+ “If you ask about the happiness of being united with the beloved, then your mind is not pure.” - Samayasar Ga. 383. "Repentance is the return to the original place of one who has gone to another place due to being overpowered by delusion from his own place."

There is a need to perform the act of Yagdristi-Susukhya, but for those who are fulfilled, there is no need for anything. Those who are completely satisfied by the taste of the nectar of supreme knowledge, they no longer need any support or means, because the one who has abandoned the support and means and has overcome the transmigration, such a self-existent, blissful Lord, is awakened in the eternal vision, knowledge, and detachment. In other words, they are established in the pure self-nature, in the state of eternal wakefulness, in the state of being fully awakened. Thus, since the goal has been achieved, there is no need for any means. Since the work is done, there is nothing left to do.
“The one who abandons the support and means, overcomes the transmigration;
The blissful Lord is awakened in the eternal vision, knowledge, and detachment.” —Shri Anandji.
State
This supremely knowledgeable person has completed the ultimate work, the work is complete; because since the conscious self has turned away from the division, has become detached, has attained time, and has taken hold of its own nature, since then, whatever was to be taken, it has taken it, and whatever was to be abandoned, it has abandoned it. Therefore, there is nothing left to take or leave, so what new work is left for him? Because this supremely detached, four-bodied Lord, who has abandoned the company, the body, the words, the mind, and the intellect, has purified the soul. “When the conscious self turned away from the division, attained time, and took hold of its own nature, then whatever was to be taken, it took it, whatever was to be abandoned, it abandoned it. There is nothing left to take or leave, so what new work is left for him? The one who has abandoned the company, the body, the words, the mind, and the intellect, has purified the self.” —Shri Manarsidedas-written Hindi Samaysar.
Such a supremely wonderful, detached state of knowledge, the one who has experienced it in his own life, such a supreme yogi, Shrimad Rajchandraji, in this proverb, praises this state of knowledge with great enthusiasm, saying:
“There is nothing left to take, there is nothing left to abandon; so what new work is left for him?”
“By becoming aware of the self-nature, the work is complete. Therefore, there is no field left for taking anything. The self-nature will never desire to abandon anything; and where there is only the self-nature, there is nothing else left.

But vision:  Kritakritya Jnana-dasha,  Lene-ki nahin rahi thaar?
•  Le-veki nahin rahi kaar’
(599)
No, that means renunciation also did not remain. Now when ‘taking and giving’ has ceased, what is left to do something new...?  That is, as it should be, after that, where is the net of taking and giving?  Therefore, it is said that here, ‘fullness’ has been achieved.
Shrimad Rajchandra, A. 275. (328)
What a wonderful, blessed state!  What kind of conduct, in the form of taking and giving, is left for such a Kritakritya, Purna-kaam Jnani Purusha?  Because the ignorant being performs taking and giving in the external world, the self-knower performs taking and giving in the internal world, but the Nishthita-atma does not have taking and giving in the external or internal world.  Thus, having attained the state of Niraachar Ati-chaari-ji, there is no possibility of any transgression due to the absence of its cause.  Because transgression is seen in conduct, but here, there is no conduct, so where is the transgression?  The example of the conduct of such great souls who have attained this high state of Niraachar-pada is found in the spiritual life of Shri Chidanandji Maharaj.  Shrimad Rajchandraji has said about this:
“After becoming a Jain Muni, due to his own supreme, non-dual state, he will no longer be able to follow the Yamas and Niyamas in a sequential manner, through the elements, field, time, and emotions, as he felt (Chidanandji).  The attainment of the object for which the sequential observance of Yamas and Niyamas is necessary, after the attainment of that object, it is equal to both, to continue or not to continue in that series.  This is the belief of the Tattva-jnani.”  etc. – Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 9 (2) (22)
To remove the doubt of how can there be conduct like begging, etc., it is said:
Ratnaadi Shikshaadrigbhyo’nya yatha drikoo taniyojane.
Tathaachaar kriyaapyasya saivaanya phalabhedatah || 180 ||
Vritti: - Naishkshaado -  Compared to the teaching of Ratnaadi, Anya - other, friend, Chatha - like, Da - vision, Tatriyogene - in the application of Ratnaadi - they were taught, Tatha - so, Bhaasha Triyaayaa Yaagini Aachaar-kriya Pashu, Saive - that same, begging, etc. characteristic, Anya - other, different, is completely different.  For what reason?  Ta ke Matt: - Labhedhathi - the previous, worldly order was destroyed, and now it is Bhava-pagrahi Kama-kshaya Kula.

From the perspective of Ratnadishiksha, the perspective of application is different;

Yogadashtisasuya
A—Just as the perspective of application is different from the teaching of Ratnaadini, so too is the action of this Achar Kriya different due to its fruit.
Discussion
"Just as the perspective of application of Ratna is different from the teaching, so too is this." —Shri Cha, Sajja, 9–1
From the perspective of the teaching of Ratnaadi, the perspective of application is different when one is being taught; just as the perspective of application is different when one is being taught, so too is the action of this Chaogi's Bhikshaatnaadi Achar Kriya different. Why? Because of the difference, the fruit of the previous Saampaayik Karma Kshaya was there, now the fruit of Bhaapgraahi Karma Kshaya is there.
The perspective of the one who is taught is different,
The perspective of the one who is taught is different from the perspective of the one who is learning when they first learn about Ratnapariksha; because the perspective of the one who has learned and passed is different from the perspective of the one who is learning. Because the one who is learning does not have any knowledge about the subject. What is Ratna? What is its form? What are its types? What are the merits and demerits of Ratna Niyojan? What is its value? etc. All this is unknown to him. Therefore, he has a curious mind about it. Therefore, he is eager to learn about the examination of Ratna. Thus, as he studies, he becomes an expert in the subject. And then he applies the knowledge he has gained in the examination of Ratna, he performs experiments like selling, etc. In the first stage, there was only theoretical knowledge, now he has practical application. Therefore, the perspective of this stage of application is different from the perspective of the learner. Similarly, here too, the action of this Chaogi's Bhikshaatnaadi Achar Kriya is also different. Earlier, the same Bhikshaatnaadi Kriya was there, and now the same Bhikshaatnaadi Kriya is there, yet there is a great difference in perspective.
Or, the one who is learning does not even know the alphabet, the numbers, etc. He does not even know how to count. But he becomes a student and learns to count, gradually gaining theoretical knowledge, he becomes a graduate, he bathes in the river of knowledge! And then he applies the knowledge he has learned in life, he applies it in the world. His perspective as a learner is different from the perspective of the one who has learned.

## Par Drusti: A Different Perspective

(601)

The perspective of a **sadhu** (saint) who has attained **yoga** (spiritual union) is different from the perspective of a **yagi** (aspirant) who is still in the initial stages of practice. This difference is similar to the difference between the perspective of a student learning music and the perspective of a master musician.

Just as a novice musician first learns the basics of music, such as the different notes and scales, and gradually becomes proficient in the art of music, so too does a **yagi** develop their understanding of **aachar** (conduct) through practice. As they progress, their perspective changes, and they become adept at **aachar** in a way that is natural and effortless. They can then effortlessly perform any **rag** (musical mode) with complete absorption, captivating the audience.

Similarly, the perspective of a **yagi** in the initial stages of practice is different from the perspective of a **sadhu** who has attained **jnana** (knowledge) through **yoga**. Just as a novice's understanding of a gem, a letter of the alphabet, or music is different from that of an expert, so too is the perspective of a **yagi** on **aachar** different from that of a **sadhu**.

This difference arises because the **yagi** is still subject to **kashya** (passions), while the **sadhu** has overcome them. The **yagi**'s actions are motivated by a desire to reduce **kashya**, while the **sadhu**'s actions are motivated by **jnana**. The **yagi**'s body is a tool for **samaya** (self-control), while the **sadhu**'s body is a vessel of **jnana**.

The **sadhu**'s perspective is characterized by a deep understanding of the subtle nature of **kashya**. Even the slightest trace of **kashya** is a cause for concern, as it can lead to **kaladosha** (temporal defilement).

**Shri Haribhadrasuriji** in his **Pachashka Shastra** states that a **sadhu** may experience a slight **sanjwalan kashya** (momentary passion) due to **kaladosha**, but they are not truly subject to **kashya**. If they are, then they are not a true **sadhu**.

**Sanjwalan kashya** arises from **atichar** (excess), while **anantanubandhi kashya** (deep-rooted passions) lead to **vratabhang** (violation of vows) and require **prayashchitta** (penance).

**"Chariman vi tah neyam sanjwalan kashya sangamam cheva. Maithaanam payen asai pi hu kaladoshen. Savveviya aiyara sanjwalanaanam tu udayo honti. Moochekh pul hoar vasaru layalu."** - **Shri Pachashka**

The great sage, with his keen insight, cannot even compare the subtle karmic particles to a speck of dust in the eye. Therefore, he strives with all his being to eliminate even the minutest karmic particle from all the realms of the soul, and attains the state of complete detachment (Vitaraga). But now, even the slightest trace of karmic attachment has completely vanished, Vitaraga has been attained, the fatal (Ghatik) has been destroyed, so the only purpose here is the destruction of the karmic bondage (Bhogagrahi karma). The body that this supreme yogi is currently inhabiting is only for the purpose of destroying the karmic residue (Prarabdha karma) that he is destined to experience in this final body, which is characterized by name, lineage, and lifespan. Therefore, the acts of begging, etc., that he performs for the sustenance of this body, are also done for the destruction of the karmic bondage. Thus, in the past, the destruction of the karmic bondage (Sampraayik karmakshaya) was the result of the actions of begging, etc., and here, the destruction of the karmic bondage (Bhogagrahi karmakshaya) is the result. Thus, the difference in the cause reveals the difference in the effect.

The implication here is that the Vitaraga, the supreme sage, who has completely destroyed all karmic attachments, continues to exist in this final body until the end of its lifespan, and by doing so, he pays off the remaining karmic debt and sheds the body, even though he is already liberated. Thus, the wise man, who is liberated from the body, continues to exist in the body, but experiences the state of complete liberation (Jivanmukta) - a state beyond the body. He lives in the world, but is free from the body. Such a liberated soul, who is endowed with the state of liberation (Videha), walks the earth, showering the world with the rain of supreme truth (Paramarth), enlightening the noble souls, and performing the greatest service to humanity. Such a pure soul, like a wish-fulfilling tree (Kalpavruksha), is worshipped by the blessed souls. For example:

"Ajitvirya Jin, wandering... mind, a lotus in the sky, beyond the body... future... mobile, a tree of virtue... mind, serves, blessed, blessed is he... future - Shri Devchandraji."

"Even though he has a body, his state is beyond the body; to the feet of such a wise man, countless salutations." - Shrimad Rajchandraji's Shri Atmasiddhi.

"By the application of this principle, the great soul becomes fulfilled, just as the gem merchant becomes fulfilled by the application of his principle. Similarly, the great sage becomes fulfilled by the application of the principle of renunciation." - Annishe - By the application of this principle, by the application of the principle of the gem, the great soul here in the world, just as the gem merchant becomes fulfilled, just as the gem merchant becomes fulfilled; similarly, this, the great sage, by the application of the principle of renunciation, the great sage, becomes fulfilled.

**On Sight:** The Muni-Ravani, by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa, is accomplished.
(603) Just as the great soul becomes accomplished by the application of gems, so too does this great Muni become accomplished by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa. 181
Meaning - Just as the great soul becomes accomplished by the application of gems, so too does this great Muni become accomplished by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa.
Discussion - "By that application, the Muni obtains the supreme knowledge." - Sakza. 8, 2,
Just as the great soul-gem merchant becomes accomplished by the application of gems, so too does this Muni, with pure sight, become accomplished by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa.
The gem merchant, who knows how to examine gems, is considered accomplished when he conducts business with gems with pure sight. Because, no matter how much knowledge one has about examining gems, it is not considered meaningful or accomplished until the gem merchant has put it into practice in business-exchange. But the knowledge of examining gems is essential for the purpose of buying and selling gems, and only when this knowledge is applied in business and used to gain desired benefits, is it considered accomplished, only then is it considered done.
Similarly, this Muni, with pure sight, becomes accomplished by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa, that is, by the specific practice of pure sight, by the business of Dharma, because no matter how much knowledge one has about Dharma-Sannyasa, no matter how much training one has received in Dharma-Sannyasa, it is not considered meaningful for the sake of the ultimate goal until it is put into practice in a decisive and pure way. But the training in knowledge, vision, and character, which was essential for the attainment of the rightness of Dharma-Sannyasa, is now being put into practice in a practical way, and the ultimate benefit of the self is being derived from it. Therefore, here, in this sight, the application of Dharma-Sannyasa (Practice) is accomplished. That is, here, the great Muni, who is like a gem merchant, becomes accomplished by the application of Dharma-Sannyasa, which is like the gem trade, and obtains the desired benefit of the self. Here, he crosses over, here his work of self-realization is done.

The collection of yogic insights culminates here, where one truly becomes a "Dharmasanyasi" (one who has renounced worldly attachments) and a "Yogi-Sanyasi" (a yogi who has renounced worldly attachments), attaining ultimate self-welfare. Because this insight, compared to the previous Dharmasanyasa yoga, was, in essence, non-essential. It required the renunciation of the activity-oriented Dharma. Therefore, although non-essential, it was rightly called "Dharmasanyasa" and was also essential and beneficial for attaining the qualification of essential Dharmasanyasa. Therefore, it was also fittingly called Dharmasanyasa in a remedial sense. But here, it is essential Dharmasanyasa yoga. Dharma means the path of non-violence, and here, it is renounced. Therefore, this Dharmasanyasa yoga is truly and ultimately real.
Thus—
द्वितीयापूर्वकरणे मुख्योऽयमुपजायते । केवलश्रीस्ततश्चास्य निासपत्ना सदोदया ॥ १८२ ॥ In the second pre-action, this one arises as the main. (Therefore, it is called Niravarana-Nidyaya, Kevalashri, and Sadodaya). 182.
Meaning - In the second pre-action, this Dharmasanyasa arises as the main, and therefore, this being has Nissapanna-Niravarana (free from obstacles) and Sadodaya (always arising) Kevalashri.
Discussion - In the second pre-action, which is a series, this Dharmasanyasa yoga arises - it begins with the restrained and controlled, starting from the remedial stage. And through the application of this Dharmasanyasa, this being attains Kevalashri, which is Niravarana (free from obstacles) and Sadodaya (always arising) due to the absence of opposition.
The Dharmasanyasa yoga mentioned here, when is it truly essential Dharmasanyasa? This is clarified here. Essential Dharmasanyasa is attained at the time of the second pre-action in the series. Although the remedial Dharmasanyasa, which is non-essential, begins from the restrained and controlled Gunasthanas, it is Dharmasanyasa, and it is extremely beneficial for becoming qualified to attain essential Dharmasanyasa. This non-essential Dharmasanyasa - in the second pre-action - in the series of pre-actions, this Dharmasanyasa, which is the main, arises - it begins with the restrained and controlled, starting from the remedial stage. And through the application of Dharmasanyasa, this being attains Nissapanna-Niravarana (free from obstacles) and Sadodaya (always arising) due to the absence of opposition.

On the topic of **Tattvika Dharma-sanyasa**, **Kevalashri** says: “**Shrimadbhagwan Jin** (605) In **Sanchasa**, the **Dharmas** that are characterized by activity are **Sanyasa-tyaga**, and in **Tattvika Dharma-sanyasa**, the **Dharmas** that are in the form of **Kshaya-upshama** are **Sanyasa-tyaga**. Therefore, the term **Dharma-sanyasa** is true.

Here, it is said that this **Tattvika Dharma-sanyasa** is revealed in the second **Apuurvakaran**, which is meaningful because the first **Apuurvakaran**, which is the cause of **Granthibhed**, cannot have this presented **Dharma-sanyasa**. Therefore, it is mentioned in the second **Apuurvakaran** as an exception. Thus, there are two **Apuurvakaranas**: (1) The first, which is the cause of **Granthibhed**, and (2) The second, which is during the **Kshapak-shreni**. What is this **Apuurvakaran**? “**Apuurva**” means the **Shubh-prashasta Atma-parinam** that has never been attained before in the endless cycle of births and deaths. The fruit of the first **Apuurvakaran** is **Granthibhed**, and the fruit of **Granthibhed** is **Samyagdarshan**. And then, when this second **Apuurvakaran** - **Apuurva Atma-parinam** is attained after the **Karma-sthiti** has been transcended, like the countless oceans, this **Tattvika Dharma-sanyasa** is revealed to the **Samarthya-yogi** who ascends the **Kshapak-shreni**. (For the reason behind calling this **Apuurvakaran**, see pages 43-44).

Having attained this **Apuurva Atma-samarthya** in the form of **Apuurvakaran**, and having revealed the **Param Atma-vilas**, the **Yogi-purusha** who ascends the **Kshapak-shreni** has the **Samarthya-yoga** of this **Tattvika Dharma-sanyasa**, because he progresses by **Kshapan** of the **Kshaya-upshama** **Dharmas**, completely consuming the **Karma-prakriti**, consuming it with **Kevala**, destroying it, eliminating it, and rapidly ascending the **Gunasthanaka** series. And thus, destroying the **Karma-shatru**, renouncing the **Kshaya-upshamika Dharmas**, this supremely powerful **Veer Sanyasi** surpasses the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th **Gunasthanas**, and reaches the 13th **Gunasthan** of **Sagi Kevali**, revealing his **Nij Kevalgyan Nidhan**. (See Figure 3, page 50).

And thus, through the application of **Dharma-sanyasa**, this **Samarthagi** attains **Kevala-lakshmi** - **Kevalashri**, meaning the birth of **Kevalgyan-darshan**, which is not obstructed by any **Prathibhandhak**, **Virethak**, or **Pratipaksharoop Avaran**. This **Niravaran Kevalashri** is **Shrimadbhagwan Sadideya**, meaning it is always **Udayavanti** because it is always **Abhav Bhagwan** for its **Pratipat**. Therefore, this unparalleled **Kevalashri** is always present in this **Shrimadbhagwan Jinrajrajeshwar Atma-samrajya Lakshmi**. Its **Apuurva** description has been sung by **Kaviraj Devchandraj** in a characteristic style:

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya: “O Maha-bhadra Jin-raj! Raj-raj is seated today on your throne; your ksayaika veerya is infinite, you are the master of dharma, the great lord…
I am a sacrifice to the feet of Shri Jinavar. The doer, the devotee, the feeling, the cause, the reason, all are the Swami, the lord; Jnana-ananda is the minister, the light of dharma for all things. I am a sacrifice to Samyag-darshan, the friend, the stable, the unwavering, the non-contradictory;
The uninterrupted samadhi, the hair, the undying, the self-bliss… ” – Shri Devchandraji, because in this Atma-samrajya, the lord, Shrimad Bhagavan, all the characteristics of the emperor, Raj-rajeshwar, are seen. For example, in him, the infinite ksayaika veerya is manifested, and therefore, due to the unbroken nature of dharma, which is the nature of the self, Shri Jin-raj has become the “Vada Saheb”, the greatest lord. He is the Raj-rajeshwar of the self-feeling, the doer, the devotee, the cause, the reason, therefore, he is the Swami, the lord, who is manifested in the self-form. He has Jnana-ananda as his minister, who illuminates all things with the light of dharma; and he has Samyag-darshan as his friend, who establishes the stable, unwavering, non-contradictory, who takes care of everything being right. He has the uninterrupted samadhi, the self-bliss, the undying, the inexhaustible treasure. He has countless Atma-pradesh, his countries, which are filled with qualities in their own way. He has the unbroken fortress of charitra, the invincible fort, which has been built to conquer the enemy, the other-feeling, with the power of the self. He has the army of dharma, like kshama, etc. He has the mighty power of parinati-prabhutva, the lordship of self-parinati. This lord has taken on all the elements in a manifested form, in an infinite way. He has destroyed all the enemies, the material-feeling, and has come as the “Saheb”, the lord, and he is filled with the knowledge and qualities, which are the enjoyment and use of the natural nature.
The countries, countless pradesh, filled with qualities in their own way; the unbroken fortress of charitra, the power of the self, the victory that has been achieved… I am a sacrifice, the army of dharma, kshama, etc., the mighty power of parinati, your power, the mighty one; the lord has taken on all the elements, in an infinite way. I am a sacrifice, the material-feeling, the enemy, the destruction of all, the lord has come; the enjoyment and use of the natural nature, filled with knowledge and qualities… ” – Shri Devchandraji.
The overview, the policy, says, for the purpose of determining the authorized thing…

**On the Vision: Shri Jinrajrajeshwar: Self-Moon, Knowledge-Moonbeam**

(607) Situated like the cool-rayed moon, the being by nature, pure in essence. Knowledge like moonbeam, its covering like clouds. 183

**Meaning:** The being, like the moon, is situated by nature, pure in essence; and knowledge is like moonbeam, its covering is like clouds.

**Commentary:** The soul, like the moon, is situated by its inherent nature, pure in essence, there is nothing to be established. And the knowledge that exists is like moonbeam, like moonlight. This is merely a simile for the liberated soul. And the covering, meaning the covering of knowledge, is like clouds.

Every thing is situated in its own form by its pure nature, there is nothing new to be established. Similarly, the soul is also situated by its pure nature, there is nothing new to be established. Here, the simile of the self-moon and the moon is perfectly apt. Just as the moon is situated in the sky by nature, naturally, so too the soul is situated in the space of consciousness by its own nature, naturally. Just as the moon, situated in its own place in the sky, spreads moonbeam, so too the soul, situated in its own form, spreads knowledge-moonbeam. But just as the moonbeam illuminates the earth and other things, but the moon does not become earth-like, so too the soul, illuminating the world with knowledge-moonbeam, does not become world-like. Thus, the moon, spreading its own illuminating moonbeam, remains situated in its own place, so too the soul, spreading its own illuminating knowledge-moonbeam, remains situated in its own nature. This is the certainty, the situation is by pure nature. And that nature never becomes otherwise, because becoming another substance is not its nature, but another nature (see p. 483, and p. 75). The soul has the nature of being self-illuminating, knowing, therefore it is situated in the world, not established, not to be established, like the cool-rayed moon, the being, the soul, by its inherent nature. 

**Meaning:** The essence of the being is pure in essence, like the moon. And the knowledge is like moonbeam, like moonlight. This is merely a simile for the liberated soul. And the covering, meaning the covering of knowledge, is like clouds.

(608)
Even though one knows about the *Gadasti*, it doesn't make them become the universe. In this regard, it is worth contemplating again and again the profound and mysterious *Vachanamrut* of the supreme *Tattva-darshta*, Shrimad Rajchandraji.
The moon illuminates the earth, and due to the brilliance of its rays, the entire earth becomes illuminated, but the moon never becomes the earth. Similarly, this soul, which illuminates the entire universe, never becomes the universe, it always remains in its pure *chaitanya* form. Believing in the oneness of the soul in the universe is delusion.” – Shrimad Rajchandra. 760 (433),
“What is this new knowledge you have received, O Lal? Knowledge does not go away, it remains.
The known and the unknown, the knowable, O Lal, are known just as they are.” – Shri Devchandraji.
And thus, even though it is situated in its pure nature, the moon is covered by clouds, obscured, and its true form is not visible. Similarly, the soul, situated in its pure nature, is covered by *jnana-avaranas* and other karmic clouds, obscuring it, and its true form is not visible. However, no matter how dense the clouds are, just as the moon's shadow never disappears, and its light never fails to pierce through the clouds, “The moon does not hide, the clouds cast a shadow”; similarly, the soul-moon, which is pure *kevaljnana*, no matter how dense the karmic veil that covers it, its brilliance never diminishes, its *jnana-jyotsna* always peeks through, revealing its *chaitanya* form. That is why the scriptures say that a part of *kevaljnana*, as vast as an infinite number of *aksharas*, always remains revealed. Otherwise, the being who is bewildered would attain the state of being non-living. Therefore, even though *kevaljnana-avaranas* prevent *jnana* from attaining full illumination, a faint light, a partial illumination, always remains visible. And the cause of this faint light is also the present *kevaljnana-avaranas*. Thus, due to the same cause, *kevaljnana-avaranas*, full illumination in the form of *kevaljnana* does not arise, and a faint light, a partial illumination, arises. *Suvi mevamudra ti ma valan??* – Shri Nandi Sutra, 42
Even in this faint light, there is a sense of immediacy, a sense of abundance, a picture… “*Sabjivaanapi ya nan akkharass anantatamo bhago niccughhadiyo chitthai,*
*So vish karu varijna te vivo nivattala pavza* – Shri Nandi Sutra, 42 * “*Ayam cha svabhavah kevaljnanaavaranavritasya jivasya ghanapatalachchhannasya,*
*Vevi maya%ara rutuyuth tatra dettu varjnanaavaranameva*” – Shri Jnanabindu,

**On the Sight:** The cloud of the veil of omniscience, the fading of the dim light.
(609) The strange distinctions appear, the reason for which is the other karma like the veil of knowledge. Just as the sun's light, which is not covered by clouds, appears dim through the holes in the cloth or the wall, so too, the knowledge of the soul, which is covered by the veil of omniscience, appears dim due to the other karmas like the veil of knowledge, which are present in the interval. There is a difference in the degree of dimness. And therefore, due to the infinite distinctions in the fading of the karmas like the veil of knowledge, infinite distinctions in knowledge like the veil of knowledge are born. + Whatever may be the case, the light of the soul-moon is always uncovered to some extent. That is why it is said that knowledge is an extraordinary quality of the soul that illuminates itself and others. "Tatra jnanam tavadatmanah svaparaavabhaasakah asaadhaarano gunah."
-Sri Yashovijayaji's Jnanabindu

Nature's creation says -
Ghatikarma is like a cloud, the wind blows;
When it goes away, the glorious one becomes the omniscient. 184
Meaning - Ghatik karma is like a cloud, which is blown away by the wind of yoga, then the glorious one becomes the omniscient.
Analysis - Ghatik karma, like the veil of knowledge, is like a cloud. It is blown away by the wind of dharma-sannyasa, which was just mentioned.
Action - Ghatik karma, the veil of knowledge, etc., and the veil of knowledge, the veil of perception, the veil of attachment, and the veil of obstruction. These are like clouds. Ghatik karma, which is mentioned here, is blown away by the wind of yoga. When it goes away, the glorious one becomes the omniscient. +"Sa cha apantaraalaabhasthitamatijnaanaadyaavaranakshayopaashamabhedasaampaaditam naanaatvam bhajate | GhanapatalaachchhannareveH mandaprakaash iva antaraalasthakutakutaayaadyaavaranavivarapravesaat ||"

##  The Collection of Gadashti

When the series of [karma] comes to an end, it disperses, and then through the supreme effort, one attains the knowledge of the Shriman, becoming a Kevali-Sarvagna.

The four "Ghatikarma" are: Jnanavarniya, Darshanavarniya, Mehniya, and Antaraya. They speak of the inherent qualities of the soul, hence "Ghati" - destroyers. Jnanavarniya karma covers the soul's inherent quality of knowledge, destroying it. Darshanavarniya karma covers the soul's inherent quality of perception, destroying it. Mehniya karma destroys the soul's supreme decisive quality of Samyaktava, and the quality of character that is stable in the nature of knowledge and perception. Antaraya karma destroys the soul's infinite quality of vigor. Thus, because they destroy the inherent qualities of the soul, these four karmas are given the true name "Ghatikarma."

Patatva-guna-na hi nivaiti vasthati: - Shri Panchaadhyayee.

Among these four Ghatikarma, Mehniya karma is the most powerful. It is called the king because while other karmas like Jnanavarniya only cover the soul's respective qualities, Mehniya karma transforms the soul's respective Mehniya qualities into the opposite taste. Darshan Mehniya, the king of the soul, transforms the quality of Samyaktava, which is the form of correct faith, into the opposite form of Mithya faith.

## Paradrushti: The King of Mahiy Karma, Ghati-Aghati Nature (611)

It [Paradrushti] turns one towards Mithyatva. And it transforms the virtuous nature of the Mahiy soul, which is the state of its inherent qualities, into a state of division. Thus, it commits the most wicked and vile act of transforming the supreme, nectar-like qualities of the soul into a state of distorted, poisonous existence. While other karmas merely act as coverings or obstacles, this great [!] Mahiy karma, using its own cunning, turns things upside down! That is why it is the most terrifying and dreadful enemy of the soul. Its power depends on the strength of the Nayak [the soul], and when the Nayak's strength weakens, the power of other karmas also diminishes. Thus, being the supporter and nourisher of other karmas, the Mahiy, deserving of the name "King of Karma," is truly so.

There are infinite types of karma, of which eight are the main ones. Among them, the Mahiy is the most important, as I have taught. The divisions of Mahiy are: 1) Darshan and 2) Charitra. It destroys 1) Aedh and 2) Vitragata. This is the sure remedy.

"The eight fundamental natures of karma are divided into four Ghati and four Aghati. The four Ghati are called so because they destroy the qualities of the soul, meaning they (1) cover those qualities, or (2) weaken them, or (3) distort them. The nature of these Ghati is to destroy the soul's qualities. The ones that cover the qualities of knowledge and Darshan are called (1) Jnanavarniy and (2) Danavarniy respectively. The Antaray nature does not cover the qualities, but it obstructs their parts, sub-parts, etc., and hinders their functioning. In this case, the soul understands and perceives things, so there is no covering; but even while understanding, it creates obstacles and hindrances in the parts, etc., so it is not a covering, but an Antaray nature. Thus, there are three Ghati natures of the soul. The fourth Ghati nature is Mahiy. This nature does not cover, but it deceives and entices the soul, making it deviate. Despite having knowledge and Darshan, it does not create obstacles, but it still distorts the soul, making it run on the wrong path, causing it to move. Therefore, it is called Mahiy. Thus, these four are called Ghati natures. The other four natures are connected to the soul's domain, perform its work, and are destroyed accordingly. However, they are not destructive in the sense of covering, obstructing, or distorting the soul's qualities. Therefore, they are called Aghati." - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrank 793 (Updesh Noand, 39)

The remaining four karmas, other than these four Ghati karmas, are called Aghati. 

Page #688:
---------------------------
(12)
The collective of karma is called "Gadasti". Ayu, Nama, Gotra and Vedaniya are "Aghati" karma, because they do not destroy the inherent knowledge-perception qualities of the soul. However, Aghati karma does assist in the destruction of Ghati karma, but it does not itself destroy the inherent knowledge-perception qualities of the soul. Nevertheless, it does exhibit its own unique power. For example, due to Ayu karma, the soul resides in a particular body for a limited time, meaning Ayu karma binds the soul to the prison of the four-fold world, and thus harms the soul's perception qualities. Nama karma deceives the soul's inherent qualities of being invaluable and subtle, causing the soul to manifest in various locations, forms, and bodies. Therefore, Nama karma gives the soul various names, like a painting drawn by a painter, making the soul multi-faceted and multi-formed! Gotra karma harms the soul's inherent qualities of being heavy and light, causing a pure, homogeneous soul to experience the disparity of high and low Gotras. Vedaniya karma destroys the soul's inherent quality of uninterrupted happiness, causing the soul to experience both happiness and sorrow, like a thorny path covered with honey. Thus, these four Aghati karma, although not fundamentally destructive of the soul's qualities, do have their own unique effects and play their respective roles. - Thus, among these eight types of karma, the destructive karma like knowledge-obscuring karma is like a cloud. When it is shattered by the wind of Dharma-sannyasa yoga, it dissolves, and through the power of supreme effort, one becomes a Shriman Dharma-sannyasa Jnana-kevali, that is, an omniscient Supreme Soul. Just as clouds are scattered by the wind, so too is the cloud of destructive karma shattered by the force of Dharma-sannyasa. This powerful Dharma-sannyasa, as mentioned earlier, begins with the eighth "Apuurvakaran" state, where the process of destruction begins. Here, the powerful yogi, with his unique self-effort and self-indulgence, mounts the chariot of destruction and, while destroying karma, consuming it, and eliminating it, he progresses forward, manifesting his heroism in the seat of the soul, like a great warrior. He continuously increases his restraint, which is the state of the soul, and, while throwing away the shackles of karma, he leaps forward to the higher and higher states of being, increasing the growth of the destructive force. Finally, at the end of the twelfth state, he destroys all Vedaniya karma and attains the supreme state of being, the supreme state of being free from attachment, the supreme state of being free from attachment.
* "Tat: Seshajan Cha Vaari Vivaana!
Gunaana Baatmi Varaavo Vyaatmiraatti Ni" - Shri Panchaadhyaayi,

From the perspective of Dharma, the four karmas are destroyed and the self-moon shines brightly.
“Even at that time, the hero knows, your victory is certain;
With the strength of meditation, you will reach your own true place.” — Shri Anandghanji.
(613)

And as the knowledge-obscuring karma is destroyed, the remaining three karmas, namely the knowledge-obscuring karma, the perception-obscuring karma, and the obstruction karma, are also destroyed. Thus, with the victory of the hero, the self is victorious, the victory drum beats, and the self, as the conqueror of the enemies of karma, becomes known in the world as a ‘Jina’, an ‘Arihant’, a ‘Veer’.

Perfect Knowledge
“A little virtue, a little happiness, a little knowledge, a little detachment, a little Lord;
Purity, unity, sharpness, with these feelings, the enemy of karma is defeated and the victory drum beats.” — Shri Devchandraji.
“I seek refuge at the feet of the hero, I seek heroism;
I will dispel the darkness of false attachment and fear, I will sound the victory drum.” — Shri Anandghanji.

And thus, when the four karmas, like clouds, covering the self-moon, are destroyed, the self, in its pure, natural state, shines brightly as the light of the self. Just as the moon shines in its full glory when the clouds are removed, so too, when the karmic clouds are removed, the self-moon, the king of the people, shines in its full glory as perfect knowledge, and shines brightly in its pure, natural state.

“Where the four karmas are destroyed, there is the destruction of the seeds of rebirth;
The knower of all, the seer of all, is pure, the Lord has accomplished his task, infinite light, an unprecedented opportunity.” — Shrimad Rajchandraji.

Therefore, it is said:
क्षीणदोषोऽथ सर्वज्ञः सर्व लब्धिफलान्वितः । परं परार्थ संपाद्य ततो योगान्तमश्रुते ॥ १८५ ॥
Vritti: - क्षीणदोषः - क्षीणु दोष, whose, सर्वज्ञः - omniscient, without any obscurations of knowledge, with the cessation of all desires. Then, having done, सर्व लब्धि फलान्वितः - endowed with all the fruits of attainment, - संवाद्य - having accomplished the highest good, शाभव्या सम्यक्त्वादि चोलांतमस्तुत - then he attains the end of yoga, the end of the cycle of births and deaths.

The one who has completely eradicated all the karmic impurities, is omniscient, and has attained all the fruits of liberation, after accomplishing the ultimate purpose, attains the end of yoga (liberation). 185. Meaning - After eradicating all the karmic impurities, the omniscient one, who is endowed with all the fruits of liberation, attains the end of yoga after accomplishing the ultimate purpose.
**Commentary**
Thus, the one who has eradicated all the karmic impurities, is omniscient by virtue of the knowledge of non-attachment, and is endowed with all the fruits of liberation due to the cessation of all the karmic activities. Such an omniscient one, who is endowed with all the fruits of liberation, bestows the ultimate benefits of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, etc., upon the worthy beings, according to their capacity, and performs the ultimate act of compassion. And then, he attains the end of yoga.
The one whose all karmic impurities, including attachment, etc., are eradicated, becomes a Vitaraga-Jina, and the one who becomes Vitaraga, is immediately omniscient. This is the rule. All the karmic impurities are contained in the three main karmic impurities: attachment, aversion, and delusion. The one who has transcended these three karmic impurities, is free from all karmic impurities and is the ultimate Vitaraga, because these three karmic impurities cause the 'Sannipat' (downfall) of the soul, i.e., the soul falls from its pure and true nature. But when these karmic impurities are destroyed, there is no downfall from the true nature of the soul, but the soul remains in its natural and true state. The soul remains in its natural and true state. This is the state of the ultimate Vitaraga, and this is the truly divine 'Mahadeva-pan' (state of the great Lord). Therefore, it is said, "The one who has no attachment, which is the cause of karmic impurities, forever, and who has no aversion towards the fuel of calmness, like the fire towards the fuel, and who has no delusion, which covers the knowledge and causes impure conduct, is called the 'Mahadeva', whose glory is known throughout the three worlds."
"Yasyasankleshajanano rago nasty eva sarvada. Na cha dvesho'pi sattveshu shameindhanadavanalah. Na cha moho'pi sajgnanachchhadano'shuddhavrittakrit. Trilokkhyatamhimamahadevaha sa uchyate."
- Shri Haribhadracharya's Ashtak
The eighteen karmic impurities are absent in the Vitaraga Jina, or in other words, the one who has transcended the eighteen karmic impurities, is the ultimate Vitaraga, who is free from all karmic impurities. Others, who are attached to the karmic impurities, and who are endowed with attachment, etc., are...

On the sight, the special victor, "Mahadeva"-18 faultless Jindev (15) gives reverence, to whom this Bhagwan Jin-Vitrag has removed from the root, uprooted from the root, as "Servant, how can we ignore, O Mallijin! This is a good adornment; to whom we give great respect, you have removed the root." - Shri Anandghanji.
The knowledge-form of the soul, which is eternal, on which infinite layers of ignorance of infinite time had settled, this Bhagwan Vitrag pulled it out and revealed it.
See that Turiya state, which has made the state of ignorance associated with the eternal angry! And when it went away, it didn't even leave a trace! He didn't even feel sorry for it! Thus, this Bhagwan has retired the ignorance defect.
From the four states of sleep, dream, wakefulness, and wakefulness, the fourth state of wakefulness was attained by Bhagwan. That is, in the natural state of the self, he attained the unbroken wakefulness, self-awareness, continuous, extreme wakefulness; and the two states of sleep and dream, knowing that they were angry, started to go, even this master of his own form did not persuade them! He did not persuade the beloved of long time! Thus, Bhagwan, who attained the supreme state of knowledge, which is extremely awake and awake, retired the extreme state of sleep.
Your eternal knowledge-form, you took it; see the state of ignorance, angry, going, not leaving a trace. O Manijin! Sleep, dream, wakefulness, wakefulness, Turiya state came, sleep, dream, giving state, angry, knowing, not respecting the Lord... O Manijin!"
The harlot named Mithyamati, who was connected with this being from the beginning, was connected, knowing her to be a wicked, wicked, adulterous woman, this great soul

## Yoga-drishti Samuchaya

Then, - assume the gait of a dog! But just like "dogs bark behind an elephant", they kept barking foolishly! And the Lord's ride continued, ignoring them! Meaning, these insignificant, lowly faults became insignificant in the presence of this supreme, self-controlled being, completely unable to have any effect on him!
(616)
Om, "Fear, lowly, Karasali"
Far away
Laughter, excess, desire, greed, fear, lowly, Karasali;
Climbing the series of elephants, assuming the gait of a dog...Ha Majin!

The passions of anger, hatred, and restlessness, which were the wounds of the charitra-meh, as soon as this Lord's state of freedom from passions manifested, immediately fled, running away! Moreover, the Lord abandoned all the karma-kasya karma, which was like the Vedic scriptures, the result of desires and passions. Thus, destroying the charitra-meh, becoming free from all causes, this supremely merciful Lord, who is an ocean of compassion, manifested the infinite fourfold state", meaning he attained infinite knowledge, infinite vision, infinite bliss, and infinite liberation.
6
Chadda'
"The state of anger, hatred, and restlessness, are like dust on the feet;
As the state of freedom from passions manifests, they rise and flee, running away...Ha Majin!
The Vedic desires and their results, all the karmic actions, he abandoned;
An ocean of compassion, free from all causes, he attained the infinite fourfold state...Ha Majin!"

Such a supreme, passionless Lord, became the giver of the state of fearless refuge, removing all obstacles related to giving. This Lord, who is filled with the essence of supreme benefit, became the remover of obstacles related to benefit, for the entire world. By becoming the master of supreme benefit, destroying all obstacles and all hindrances, this Lord became the king of the fourfold state; and by removing obstacles related to fortune and enjoyment, he became the enjoyer of complete fortune.
"He removes all obstacles related to giving for all beings, the giver of the state of fearless refuge;
He removes all obstacles related to benefit for the entire world, the essence of supreme benefit...Ha Majin!
He destroys all obstacles among the learned, attaining the complete state;
He removes all obstacles related to fortune and enjoyment, the enjoyer of complete fortune...Ha Majin!"

Thus, (1) ignorance, (2) sleep, (3) false belief, (4) laughter, (5) excess, (6) desire, (7) greed, (8) greed, (9) fear, (10) anger, (11) hatred, (12)

Behold! The Jina, the omniscient, is free from the eighteen defilements: (617) Avirati, (13) Vedodaya (Kama), (14) Danaantaraya, (15) Muni-jana-vrinda-labha-antaraya, (16) Vayantaraya, (17) Bhegantaray, (18) Upgaaya "Bhegantaray". This Jina, the liberated soul, is free from these eighteen defilements. His unique qualities are sung by the assembly of monks, and they are pleasing to the pure mind. This supreme, pure, and virtuous being, the Srimad Vitrag Dev, is examined in this way. The qualities of this Jina, who brings peace to the mind, are sung by the monks, and they too attain the state of Anandghanapada through the merciful gaze of the compassionate one. In other words, they too attain the state of inherent self-nature, which is filled with supreme bliss, like the Jineshwar.

These eighteen defilements are rejected by the body, sung by the assembly of monks; the Avirati-rupa-desha is described, the pure mind is pleased. ... Mallijin! This is how the mind is pacified, the qualities of the Jina are sung. Through the merciful gaze of the compassionate one, the state of Anandghanapada is attained. - Sri Anandghanaji.

Thus, there is a complete destruction of the covering of defilements of this Bhagwan, a complete annihilation. Just as external and internal impurities are destroyed for their own reasons, so too are the external and internal impurities of Bhagwan destroyed by the reasons of Samyagdarshan, etc. Just as the external and internal impurities of metals and stones are destroyed for their own reasons, so too are the external and internal impurities of Bhagwan destroyed by the reasons of Samyagdarshan, etc. Kshaya: Sarvagna means that the defilements that are objects of compassion and obstacles, as well as the coverings of knowledge and perception, are completely destroyed. And thus, with the destruction of these obstructive defilements, he who is free from defilements necessarily becomes omniscient. In other words, he attains the state of Kevalgyan, which is free from all coverings, and thus he sees all beings directly, and knows all the states of all substances. (See page 356, and page 349 footnote.)

This matter of omniscience is as follows: Subtle, hidden, and distant objects are directly perceived by someone, because they are inferable, like fire, etc. In other words, subtle means naturally separated, hidden means separated by time, and distant means separated by space. Such objects are directly perceived by someone because they are inferable, or provable. And what is provable is directly perceived by some special person, or what is inferable is directly perceived by someone. For example, fire, etc. Moreover, omniscience...

The second standard technique regarding the attainment of *gadarissusthay siddhi* is this: that which is characterized by *taratambhav* has a limit of excellence. For example, importance is a quality characterized by *taratambhav*. Its ultimate limit is attained in the sky, meaning that the sky is the greatest. Similarly, the quality of knowledge is characterized by *taratambhav*. Therefore, its attainment of excellence in some particular person is definitely possible. And the one in whom this knowledge attains excellence is the omniscient. This is the occasion! (See - *Shri Haribhadrasuri*’s *Sarvajnasiddhi Prakarana*, *Jnana Bindu*, *Apt Mimamsa* etc.).

Such a *kshinadosha* (one with minimal faults) - *param nirdosha* (perfectly faultless), virtuous *Shrimad Sarvajnya Bhagavan* is united with all the fruits in the form of attainment. The attainment of *kevaljnana*, the attainment of *kevaldarshan*, infinite attainment of giving, infinite attainment of gain, infinite attainment of sharing, infinite attainment of taking, infinite attainment of all the powers - all these attainments reside in the body of this *kevali* Bhagavan. The eight great *mahasiddhis* like *animmafal* and *bhegi* *mahima* etc. revolve around him like his attendants. This Bhagavan is the abode of all the glories described in the *yogashastras* like *Patanjali* and in *Jinagama*. Due to his omniscience, which pervades all the states of all the objects, this omniscient *Shripati* is completely free from *ausush* (desire), he has no desire for anything anywhere, therefore he is the enjoyer of the fruits of all the attainments.

There is nothing greater than his own self. No influence has been produced, is present, or will be produced in this creation, which is not attained by his complete self. *Shrimad Rajchandra*, *Ank* 337 (411).

Because this *vitrag* (desireless) Lord, who is the Lord of the knower and the known, knows through his own knowledge, this Lord sees his own ordinary object by seeing his own form, this Lord, who is immersed in his own nature-like character, enjoys infinite *chaturshka* (fourfold) pleasures in his own enjoyment, this Lord, who is the enjoyer of his own nature-like fortune, enjoys infinite pleasures in his own form. This great giver, this Lord, always gives, and this God, who is the receiver and the pervader of his own power, is himself the recipient of that gift.

He knows through his own knowledge, the Lord of the knower and the known; he sees his own ordinary object by seeing his own form.

## Pas Darsti: "Sav Udhi Fal Bhegi" Dhruvpadrami

(19) Nij Rame Raman Kare, Prabhu Charitre Ramta Ram Re; Bhogya Anantne Bheg, Bhege Tine Bhokta Swami Re. Dey Dan Nit Dijate, Ati Data Prabhu Swayamev Re, Patra Tame Nij Shakti Na, Grahak Vyapakmay Dev Re. Shri Shreyans "Shridevchandraji.

Since Danaantaraaya has been destroyed, this Bhagwan gives the gift of pure, natural Atmaswaroop to the soul. Since Labhaantaraaya has been destroyed, he continuously receives the natural Atmaswaroop, which is beyond worry. Since Bhegaantaraaya has been destroyed, he gathers pure Atmaswaroop, pure good qualities, and wealth. Since Veeryantaraaya has been destroyed, he continuously consumes pure good qualities. Since Upbhogantaraaya has been destroyed, he is effortless in his Atmaswaroop Raman. He effortlessly and naturally manifests infinite Atmashakti.

"Akshay Dan Achintan, Labh Ane Bhog...Ho Jinji! Veery Shakti Aprayasata, Shudh Swagun Upbhog....Ha" - Shridevchandraji.

Thus, since he is fulfilled in his Atmaswaroop through infinite giving and receiving, this supreme Prabhu Dhruv remains in his natural, innate Atmaswaroop. Therefore, this "Dhruvpadrami" Prabhu has no desires, he is desireless. Why would he desire anything else, Swami, when his "Dhruvpadrami" home is filled with abundant, complete wealth? Why would this "Dhruvpadrami" desireless Gunaraya desire anything else, when his Atma-griha is filled with abundant, complete good qualities? Why would this "Kevali" Bhagwan use anything other than the pure Atmapad, which is the only "Dhruv"?

Dhruvpadrami Cheswami Mahara, Nikaami Gunaraya Sugyani! Nikaami He Pami Tu Dhani, Dhruv Aarami Thay - Shri Anandghanji.

While deeply contemplating this subject of attainment, the supreme truth-seer Shrimati Rajchandraji revealed the supreme, wonderful ultimate truth:

When the four powerful karmas are destroyed, the nature of the Antarayas is also destroyed. Therefore, Danaantaraaya, Labhaantaraaya, Veetaraaya, Bhegaantaraaya, and Upbhogantaraaya, these five types of Antarayas are destroyed, and infinite giving and receiving, infinite benefit,

The collection of yogic insights, the attainment of infinite dana (giving), etc., and the attainment of infinite bhega (enjoyment) and upga (absorption) are all considered to be "labdhi" (attainments). These are the ultimate, because they are the result of the destruction of the karmic obstacles. The supreme being, having destroyed all karmic obstacles, is fully capable of bestowing infinite dana, etc., and the ultimate good. However, these attainments, in the form of pudgala (matter), are not the result of the supreme being's activity. Primarily, the attainment of these labhdis is the nature of the soul itself. Because they are attained through kshayika (destruction) and not udayika (manifestation), they are the very nature of the soul. The infinite capacity that was present in the soul from the beginning, in the form of power, is now manifested, and the soul can bestow it in its own form. Similarly, it can manifest in a pure and clear way, which is called infinite dana labdhi. Also, in the attainment of infinite soul-capacity, there is no cause for even the slightest separation, hence it is called infinite laabha labdhi. Furthermore, the attainment of infinite soul-capacity is experienced entirely in the form of supreme bliss, and there is no cause for even the slightest separation in it, hence it is called infinite bhoga upga labdhi.

Similarly, even though the attainment of infinite soul-capacity is complete, the soul's power does not become tired from experiencing it, nor can it be exhausted, carried, or affected by any kind of time or space. There is nothing that can even slightly affect it. It is the complete capacity to remain in its own nature, with full power in all three times, which is called infinite veerya labdhi. From the perspective of kshayika (destruction), these labhdis are the use of the supreme being, as mentioned above. These five labhdis are differentiated for the sake of understanding, but they can all be included in infinite veerya labdhi. The soul, having attained complete veerya, has the capacity to use these five labhdis in the form of pudgala (matter). However, this is not possible for the supreme being, who is already perfect and has a completely detached nature. The activity of the supreme being, in the form of giving teachings, etc., is due to the arising of yogic preconditions, and not due to any distortion of the soul's nature.

–Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrak 840 (3) (915) and onwards.

Such a supreme being, who is omniscient, detached, and possesses all attainments, acts according to the dictates of prarabdha (past karma) and performs ultimate benevolence. This karma-free, perfect being, who is like a particle of pure consciousness, walks the earth according to the manifestation of the remaining four aghati (uncontrollable) karmas, namely bhogagrahi karma. Through the power of his compassion, he bestows ultimate benevolence upon other souls, guiding them towards the path of liberation and perfection. This compassionate being, who is an ocean of compassion, showers the world with the rain of ultimate good, bringing peace and tranquility to the suffering beings of the world. 

Page #697:

**On the sight:** Danadi Labdhi is the ultimate purpose: the ultimate benefactor.
(21) This being, without understanding its true form, suffers endless cycles of rebirth. This Supreme Guru, understanding the true form, bestows ultimate welfare upon the world, gathering and protecting the virtuous. This pure Dharma, embodied in this Lord, the friend of the world, flows towards ultimate peace, the path of peace, in which virtuous souls, immersing themselves, experience ultimate peace of the soul. Thus, this Dharma-form, Dharma-avatar, the Vitaraga Paramatma, establishes, reforms, and bestows upon the virtuous, according to their nature, and according to the merit of their parents, the attainment of Samyaktvad, etc., virtues, and gives them Dharma-benefit as appropriate. This Kevali Bhaskar, enlightening and developing the virtuous, wanders in the world. "Keval Jnana, infinite light, blossoming the lotus of the future generation... Lord, the inner knower. The essence of pure bliss, dwelling in the pure form... Lord, resting in the Dharma of the self, selfless in its transformation... Lord." - Shri Devchandraji.
And thus, until the end of life, he guides the wicked and the unrighteous away from the wicked path, and leads the righteous and the virtuous towards the desired ultimate purpose, performing the ultimate grace of benefiting all beings in the world, and then this world-loving Paramatma attains the end of yoga, attains the state of Shaileshi.
"The great Muni, with his faults extinguished, omniscient, gathers all the fruits of attainment; he does good to others, and thus attains the speed of fire." - Shri Dasakza, 8-3
"There, from that yoga, the supreme yoga, the Lord, quickly, having destroyed the disease of rebirth, attains ultimate Nirvana." 186. Meaning - There, quickly, that Lord, from that supreme yoga, destroys the disease of rebirth and attains ultimate Nirvana.
"Tatra - there, that is, in the end of yoga, in the Shaileshi state, Drava - quickly, immediately, in the time of uttering only five letters, Bhavan - the Lord, from that yoga, from that non-action, from that supreme yoga, from that yoga-leader, from that Shaileshi yoga, that is the meaning. What? That is, having destroyed the disease of rebirth, in all ways, he attains Nirvana - ultimate Nirvana, attains the state of Nirvana, that is the meaning."

Chaugdashtasamuchchay
Vivechan
Then there - in the Shaileshi state, in the form of Chaug, quickly, he, the Bhagwan, attains the supreme 'Ayag' Yoga, which is the main in the Yag, that is, the Shaileshi Chaug, destroys all kinds of Bhavyadhis and attains the supreme state of Bhava Nirvana.
In the Shaileshi state, he attains this supreme Chaug called 'Ayag', which is the best in the Bhagwan's Samyog; that is, the actions of Samaneyag, Savchanayag, and Neskayachaug cease, and he attains the supreme 'Ayagi' Dashagunasthan, which is devoid of all Yogavyapars.
Where the mind, speech, body, and karma are all gone, where all the Pudgal relationships are severed; such an Ayagi Gunasthan exists there, full of great fortune, happiness, and completeness... an unprecedented opportunity...” - Shrimad Rajchandraji,
Here, by removing the subtle, destructive, and restless activity of the mind, speech, and body, this Chaugishwar Bhagwan makes the Chetan pure, clean, and free from Aleshi and Leshya. And in the Shaileshi state, which is like Meru, that is, the state of Shaileshikarana, which is the state of self-stability, which is free from all actions and motionless, he, having attained the supreme Sav, becomes completely inactive, and destroys the subtle four remaining Karmas, the Chaugsattam. Thus, when there is a strong inspiration of the supreme Atmiya, the Chaug-kriya does not enter, so there is such a firmness and immobility of Yag in this Shaileshikarana that it cannot overcome the immovable, stable, self-power like Shaileshi-Meru - it cannot move it. (See pp. 45-46). And this Ayagi Dashagunasthan remains for the time of the utterance of the five Hasvakshar; that is, it remains for the time it takes to utter the five short letters A, I, U, R, and L. So, having attained this 'Ayag' Yagsattam, this Prabhu quickly - immediately - destroys the Bhavyadhis and attains supreme Nirvana.
Due to which the state of Bhava, the root cause of Karma, was there - the state of repeatedly taking birth in a body - all of Bhava is completely destroyed. So, due to the absence of the cause, there is no effect, according to the principle, the Bhava-Samsara is completely destroyed. Just as the seed of Bhava, the root cause of Raga, is destroyed, Raga is destroyed, similarly, the root cause of Bhavaraga, the subtle Karma, is destroyed, Bhavaraga is destroyed. So, then there is no rebirth, no more taking birth. Just as after the fire has been extinguished, 

Page #699:
---------------------------
But, due to the absence of the shell-like chariot, liberation from the cycle of birth and death is attained. (23) Just as a sprout does not emerge from a completely burnt seed, similarly, after the karma-seed is burnt, the sprout of birth does not emerge.
“दग्धे बीजे यथाऽत्यन्तं प्रादुर्भवति नाङ्कुरः । कर्मबीजे तथा दग्धे न रोहति भवाङ्कुरः ॥"
–Shri Amritchandracharya's Shri Tattvarthasar. And just as after the disease is destroyed, complete health is attained where even a speck of dust is not present; similarly, after the disease of birth is destroyed, the soul attains complete health, a state of liberation from all diseases, where even an atom of karma-disease is not present. Just as after the disease is destroyed, a human being attains their original, natural, inherent health, similarly, after the disease of birth is destroyed, the soul attains its original, natural, inherent health, its innate state, meaning the pure soul, the Lord, manifests in its natural, inherent state. And just as a healthy human being experiences natural, inherent joy after the disease is destroyed, similarly, after the disease of birth is destroyed, the soul, which is healthy in terms of birth, experiences natural, pure, inherent bliss.
"Paramanand Vilasi anubhave re, Devchandra pad vyakti... Pujana te kije re barma Jinatani re."
-Shri Devchandraji. And thus, when the disease of birth is destroyed, the Lord attains the ultimate state of liberation. Just as a lamp is extinguished when its oil runs out, similarly, the Lord attains liberation when the karma-oil runs out. Because liberation from the cycle of birth and death is attained due to the absence of karma-oil, the Lord is said to have attained liberation. Or, just as fire, which has no fuel, is extinguished when its fuel is burnt to ashes, similarly, the fire of the world, which has no fuel, is extinguished when all the karma-fuel is burnt to ashes. Therefore, it is truly said that the Lord has attained liberation. "कृत्स्नकर्मभयादूर्ध्व निर्वाणमधिगच्छति । यथा दग्धेन्धनो वह्निनिरुपादानसंततिः ॥"
–Shri Amritchandracharya's Shri Tattvarthasar. "He who has gone to the water, has become different from his own body." Shrimad Rajchandraji. "The destruction of all enemies, the destruction of all diseases, the fulfillment of all desires; all wealth, speed, and happiness are obtained from it; infinite virtues are without any blemish." -Shri . 6, Saja, 8-3

Yoga Trisamuccaya
The Essence of Para Drishti
Parardashti is rooted in Samadhi. It is free from the defilement of attachment to Samadhi, and by the logic of sandalwood fragrance, it is characterized by inherent activity, meaning it is inherently active in its nature. It is characterized by a state of detachment, transcending all conduct. And due to the absence of cause, it is not subject to any transgression; meaning it is not bound by any conduct and therefore has no potential for transgression. Just as the one who has ascended has no need for further ascent, similarly, this yogarudha purusha, due to the absence of karmas that need to be conquered through conduct, has a state of detachment.

Then why does he engage in practices like begging, etc.? The resolution of this doubt is this: Just as the perspective of the one who is being taught is different from the perspective of the one who is teaching regarding the regulation of gems, etc., similarly, the perspective of this yogi is also different regarding the same conduct. Because previously, his destruction of the subtle (including kshaya) was taking place, and now the destruction of the gross, which is the cause of rebirth, is complete. Just as the great soul, the Ratnavarna, becomes fulfilled through the regulation and practice of gems, similarly, this great sage becomes fulfilled through the regulation and practice of Dharma Sannyasa. This primary Dharma Sannyasa arises in the second incomplete stage, and through it, there is the state of Kevalashri, which is free from any obstruction and is eternally present due to its never being subject to decline.

Just like the moon, the jiva is naturally pure in its essence and does not need to be established. And the knowledge that exists is like moonlight. The veil of that knowledge is like a cloud. This cloud-like veil, when it is dispelled by the force of the Dharma Sannyasa yoga, which is like the wind, at the time of the completion of the series of destructions, then he becomes a knower of knowledge through the power of the primary yoga. Meaning, through the destruction of all defilements like attachment, etc., he becomes a knower of all, having destroyed all defilements, and he becomes a partaker of all attainments. Such a great sage, the omniscient Bhagavan, performs acts of benevolence and then attains the end of yoga. There, in the state of Shaileshi, in the brief span of time it takes to pronounce five short syllables, he, through the yoga of A-yoga, destroys the disease of rebirth and attains the ultimate state of liberation.

“Having destroyed all defilements,
The great sage, a partaker of all attainments,
Through benevolence, he attains the bliss of Shiva, being a yogi;
All enemies destroyed, all diseases extinguished, he is completely fulfilled;
Through the yoga of all, he attains bliss, and his infinite virtues are manifest.” —Shri Cha. Sajjaya.

Kevaljnana-Nirvana
The culmination of Ashtanga Yoga is the manifestation of the cycle of existence. Thus, with the cessation of the eight mental afflictions, and with the activation of the eighth Pravritti Guna, which is by nature complete activity, and with the attainment of the eighth Samadhi Gang, the eighth Darshan blossoms in full bloom. Consequently, with the completion of the cycle of disease, the cycle of existence is also completed, meaning the cycle of existence comes to an end. This cycle is truly an invincible weapon that destroys the cycle of existence. By means of this, the supreme yogi, having conquered the ocean of existence, attains the true name "Arihant" and, by achieving the perfection of his own nature, makes the name "Siddha" meaningful. The eight Gangs are the pillars of this cycle, closely connected to the axis of yoga, which is the nature of the self, and revolve around it.
Or, the yogi is the complete man. His eight limbs are the eight Gangs. Among them, Yama and Niyama are the two feet, Asana and Pranayama are the two hands, Pratyahara is the abdomen, Dharana is the chest, Dhyana is the neck, and Samadhi is the head. When these eight limbs of the yogi become complete and free from any defects, it is the complete and defectless Ashtanga Yoga - just as it is in a man with complete and defectless limbs. Any defect or incompleteness in any limb leads to a defect or incompleteness in the yogi - just as it is in a man with defective limbs. Just as every limb of the human body has its own appropriate place and function, so too does every Gang in this body have its own appropriate place and function. Just as all the limbs and parts of the body work together in coordination to perform all the actions related to the body, so too do all the limbs of the yogi work together in coordination (organic unit) to perform all the actions related to the yogi.

Yogadashti-Susura, the Yuga Purusha, performs all the processes that are conducive to the attainment of liberation.  And so on, in many ways, this simile has been explained in detail by this commentator.  It is necessary to contemplate this with one's own understanding.
Or, the Garud is a lotus with eight petals.  The eight Gani-rupa are its eight petals.  And the place where these petals meet is the Atma-svabhava-rupa, the Jan-rupa, the Yog-Karnika.
In this Atma-svabhava-rupa Karnika, the Bhagavan, the Atma-Parabrahma, resides.  As the Garud's eight-petaled Yogadashti-rupa petals develop, so too does the Yog-Kamal lotus develop.  With the opening of each Yogadashti-rupa petal, one by one,
each Chitta-dosha is eliminated, each Guna develops, and each Gyan is revealed.  Thus, with the complete development of the Yogadashti, the Garud's eight-petaled lotus attains complete development.  A complete understanding of all this can be obtained in brief from the comprehensive main diagram placed by this commentator himself at the beginning of this book on the title page.
Yogadashti Kalash Kavya
Vasantatilaka, with the heart fixed in Samadhi, is the perfect creation, the pure Chandramani, the peace, the nectar, the good creation, the art of the soul, the Chandra blooms here, the knowledge-filled, the three worlds are absorbed. 143
All the thoughts and influences are contained within, the Atma-svabhava is pure and always contained; the mind becomes merged in the Atma forever, such Samadhi manifests, bringing happiness to all. 144
With constant restraint, at every moment, the infinite, the Amla Atma-bhava grows; such a unique, pure, eternal knowledge, free from association, is always present. 145
Where the mind, filled with desires, becomes merged, the Atma becomes absorbed in its own form; in all regions, like the fragrance of sandalwood, the Atma's activity becomes its natural, inherent form. 146
Such a pure, white stream of feet, always flows naturally, free from all impurities; beyond conduct, the difficult task is this, what is there to climb for one who has already climbed? 147
Those who have climbed the highest peak of the Yuga, and those who have grown in the unique series of Gunas; they are all beyond the limitations of time, beyond the realm of thought, like the Jin-kalpa in their power. 148
The vision of the novice in the Nadi-Shikshan is like that of a novice, different from the vision of the self; the conduct, the action, is also the same, the Yogi's other fruits are different in the world. 149
The jewels are free, the jewel forest is fulfilled, the three jewels are free, the Muni, in accordance with the truth, the renunciation, the Dharma, the application, here the Yogi, becomes fulfilled, the ultimate truth, the good qualities are gathered. 150
Renunciation Dharma, doing it for all, the perishable feelings, filling the hearts of all; the Muni says, the renunciation Dharma is the path, the unique series of Gunas flows. 151

## The Kalash Kavya of the Eightfold Vision

(627)  A unique series of virtues, comparable to the direct path to liberation, ascends and shines; the twenty-four Tirthankaras, the supreme Kevalis, bless those who are eternally arising and free from attachments. 152 Just as the moon is situated in the sky by nature, so too is the Atma-chandra (inner moon) situated in its pure nature; to attain Keval Jnana (omniscience) is like the moon's light, while the veil of ignorance is like a cloud. 153 When the dense cloud of karmic actions dissipates quickly, propelled by the wind of renunciation and Dharma, then the glorious supreme Keval Jnana is attained, and one is truly called a Jnana Kevali. 154 All faults are completely eradicated, omniscience is attained, and all beings are liberated; the compassionate Muni, having achieved the highest purpose, bestows grace upon all. 155 The Lord, whose natural form is like the king of mountains, quickly attains the state of liberation, known as "Bega"; having destroyed the disease of birth and death, he attains Nirvana and resides eternally in the abode of bliss. 156

|| Thus, in the Sri Yoga Drishti Samuccaya Shastra, the eighth vision, as explained in detail by the great commentary "Sumana Anandani Brihattika" by Bhagavan Das, the son of Kirat Chandra, composed by the great sage Haribhadracharya. ||

## The Essence of Liberation*

What is there (in Nirvana)? It says:

"The liberated man in the world is like this, so is this. He is not non-existent, nor is he free from affliction, nor is he unafflicted." (187)

**Meaning:** The liberated man in the world is like this, so is this (the liberated man in Nirvana). He is not non-existent, and he is not free from affliction, meaning he is free from affliction. And he is not unafflicted.

**Commentary:** The liberated man in the world is like this liberated man who has attained Nirvana. (1) He is not non-existent, but he is like a extinguished lamp, which is a metaphor for the state of being. (2) He is not free from affliction, meaning he is free from affliction, because he is free from the test of existence. (3) He is not unafflicted, nor is he afflicted, because he has overcome affliction through the state of being.

Someone who has been suffering for a long time from a very difficult affliction. He is tormented by various ailments and cries out, "Save me!" He has a high fever in his body. The example of the imbalance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha has caused him to suffer from a severe illness. Therefore, he...

**Note:** *Chashimu* - free from affliction, afflicted, *Puman* - man. *Chadaroyadash* - like, *Tadash* - so is this, *Nit* - Nirvana. *Namavo* - non-existent, like a extinguished lamp. *No Mu* - not free from affliction, meaning he is free from affliction. *Mathapit* - unafflicted.

*This consideration of the true nature is actually a distortion of the true vision. It has been placed here separately for the sake of the subject.*

## Liberation of the Soul: The Disease of Samsara

(629)  He who has forgotten his own nature, wanders aimlessly, driven by madness.  His entire body is consumed by unbearable torment.  A sharp, piercing pain pierces his heart.  He is tormented by various kinds of ailments, overwhelmed by suffering.  If such a soul, afflicted by this great disease, receives the guidance of a supreme physician, and is given the best medicine, administered according to the prescribed method, then the disease will be eradicated.  The fever will subside, the three poisons (tri-dosha) and the deadly disease (sannipat) will vanish.  He will regain his true self-awareness, his torment will cease, the pain in his heart will disappear.  He will then be completely free from disease, restored to perfect health, strong and vigorous, and experience the fullness of well-being.  And this healthy, "swastha" man, freed from disease, experiences an indescribable joy, a taste of bliss.

In the same way, this soul has been afflicted by the great disease of samsara since time immemorial.  He has been tormented by this difficult-to-cure ailment for countless eons.  He cries out in pain, "Oh, please grant me liberation!"  A raging fever of attachment (raga) has consumed his knowledge-body, and the three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion (tri-dosha) have afflicted him.  He has lost his true self-awareness and wanders in a state of delusion, engaging in senseless activities.  His entire body is consumed by unbearable torment, a burning sensation arising from his craving for worldly pleasures.  A sharp, piercing pain of hatred (dvesha) pierces his heart.  When such a soul, afflicted by this intense disease, encounters the supreme physician, the Shrimad Sadguru, he receives the three-fold medicine of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (samyak darshan, samyak jnana, samyak charitra) through the Guru's teachings.  By diligently practicing these three jewels (ratna-trayi) as prescribed by the Guru, he gradually eradicates his disease.  The fever of attachment subsides, the pain of hatred disappears, the deadly disease of delusion (sannipat) is vanquished, he regains his self-awareness, and the torment arising from his craving for worldly pleasures is extinguished.  He then sees his true self, attains knowledge, and follows his true nature.  He knows the pure soul, the self, and dwells in the state of pure knowledge.  He becomes "swastha" and experiences the state of liberation (kevalya).  Then, until the end of his physical life, he gradually eliminates the remaining four karmas, which are like the remnants of a burnt-out wick, according to his prarabdha karma.  He completely exhausts these karmas.  Thus, completely free from karma, he is liberated from the cycle of samsara.  And this soul, freed from the disease of samsara, possessing perfect spiritual health, dwelling in his true self, this supreme "swastha" man, experiences an indescribable joy, a state of perfect bliss.

(630)
The collection of Gadasti is like a lake where a man free from disease is healthy, well, and joyful. Similarly, this pure, conscious being (soul) free from the disease of existence is supremely healthy, supremely "well", and supremely joyful. (1) This liberated being who has attained Nirvana is not devoid of anything. In other words, it is not a state of nothingness, as some (Buddhists, etc.) believe. It is not the absence of the self, but the essence of the self. That is, there is only the pure, distinct, and immaculate essence of the self, which is known as "Siddha". Just as a man freed from disease does not cease to exist when he is freed from disease, so too, the conscious being-soul freed from the disease of existence does not cease to exist when he is freed from the disease of existence. The absence of disease does not mean the absence of the man, but only reveals his pure, healthy state. Similarly, the absence of the disease of existence does not mean the absence of the soul, but only reveals its pure, healthy, and disease-free state. The soul's worldly state is removed, and the Siddha-liberated state emerges. The pure, inherent nature of the soul, where there is ultimate detachment from the body and other attachments, is revealed. (See the verses of Atmasiddhi, p. 404).
Furthermore, (2) this being-soul is not free from disease, but is free from the test of existence. Some (Samkhya, etc.) believe that this soul is always free, unbound, and never bound. But this belief is very free and full of errors. Because if we believe that, then bondage, pleasure-pain, etc., will not cease, and many faults like destruction-non-creation, etc., will arise. And the goal of that philosophy, which is liberation, will also fail! Because one who is bound has the possibility of being liberated, but one who is never bound, where is the possibility of liberation? If there is no bondage, then where is liberation? Because liberation is the process of being freed from bondage. This liberation, which is the process of being freed from bondage, is achieved here by being free from the test of existence. Therefore, one who attains liberation is not free from the disease of existence, but is free from it. Just as a "healthy" person is not free from disease, but is still free from that disease, and therefore is called healthy and disease-free, so too, the liberated soul is not free from the disease of existence, but is still free from it, and therefore is called "liberated" and free from the disease of existence. (3) And it is not that he was "disease-free" - without disease, because previously he had the essence of disease, which was manifested in various ways. It is not even said that the man free from disease had disease before, because it contradicts the direct perception. Because it is like saying "There is no tongue in the great ocean".

## Liberation of the Soul: Regamukt is Bhavamukt

(631) To say that a Regamukt is like a cured person is a contradiction. Because if someone was afflicted, how could they be free from affliction? Therefore, to say so is completely absurd. Because it is a real fact that he was suffering from the disease of existence. And only when he is freed from it, is he called free from the disease of existence.

Thus, in every way, the liberated soul is like a person who is free from disease: (1) Just as a person who is free from disease is healthy and joyful, so too is this liberated soul perfectly healthy and joyful, immersed in Regamukt. (2) Just as when a disease is cured, there is no lack of the diseased person, similarly, when the disease of existence is cured, there is no lack of the pure conscious soul. (3) Just as a person who is free from disease is not free from disease, but is free, so too is this liberated soul who has attained Nirvana not free from the disease of existence, but is free. (4) And just as a person who is free from disease was previously afflicted, without disease, but was afflicted; so too is this liberated soul who has attained Nirvana previously afflicted, without the disease of existence, but was afflicted by the disease of existence. If there was no disease, then how could it be destroyed? And how could there be liberation?  "If there is no dog, then how can it be tied?" Thus, this illustration clearly reveals the truth, like a bright lamp, which even a child can understand. How can any human being with a simple understanding not understand it? Yet, it is surprising that some philosophers, who consider themselves wise, have created many false ideas about liberation! For example, "Liberation is a state of nothingness." "This soul is eternally liberated." "This soul has never been afflicted by the disease of existence." And so on. All such alternative views are based on wrong desires and cannot stand for even a moment when examined with reason. Those who are curious about this should study the great scriptures like the Shatdarshanasamuccaya, Shastravartasamuccaya, Batris Batrisi, Tattvarthasara, etc. Due to the fear of being too lengthy, only a brief guidance has been given here. 

The same meaning is clearly stated in the following verse:

**भव एव महान्याधिर्जन्ममृत्युक्किारवान् ।**
**विचित्रमोहजननस्तीव्ररागाविवेदनः ॥१८८॥**

**Vritti:** Existence itself is the great disease, the great affliction. Why? Because it is characterized by birth and death, which are forms of change. It is the source of various delusions, and it is filled with intense passions and suffering. 

Page #708:

(632)
The collection of yogic insights states that the world is a great disease, birth, death, and change; intense passions and pains, a strange affection. 188 Meaning: - This world is a great disease. It is full of change in the form of birth and death, it produces strange affection and is full of intense passions and pains.
Discussion: This world is a great disease. What kind of disease is it? It is full of change in the form of birth and death, it is full of change like dust and so on; it produces strange affection due to the arising of false belief; and it is full of intense passions and pains due to the attachment to women and so on. What is the disease mentioned above? The author, the great sage, has clarified it here. From the ultimate point of view, the greatest disease in this world is this world itself, that is, the cycle of birth and death. This world is comparable to a great disease; because in terms of its sign, form, cause, distortion, treatment, result, and so on, there are many similarities between the two. It is like this -
Just as a disease attacks the human body and surrounds it from all sides, so too does the disease of the world attack the soul's knowledge-body and surrounds it from all sides. Just as a disease spreads from atom to atom in the body and produces its effect, so too does the disease of the world spread throughout the soul's regions and produces its effect. Just as a disease weakens the body's strength, destroys its vitality, and absorbs its blood, flesh, and other elements, so too does the disease of the world weaken the soul's infinite power, destroys its light and vitality, and absorbs its knowledge, vision, and other elements of its nature. Just as a disease causes a disturbance of the elements, so too does the disease of the world cause a disturbance of the passions, hatred, and other vices. Just as a disease confines a person to bed, makes him dependent and weak, so too does the disease of the world confines the soul to the body, makes it dependent on matter and weak. Just as a disease changes the entire appearance of a person so much that it becomes difficult to recognize him, so too does the disease of the world changes the soul's true appearance so much that it becomes difficult to recognize it.
Just as a disease is a state of ill health, unnatural, unnatural, and distorted for the human body, so too is the disease of the world a state of ill health, unnatural, unnatural, and distorted for the soul. Just as a disease is an unhealthy state of the human body, so too is the disease of the world an unhealthy state of the soul. Just as a disease is a punishment for the human body's unnatural, unnatural behavior, for its unrighteousness, so too is the disease of the world a punishment for the soul's unnatural, unnatural behavior, for its unrighteousness. Just as a disease is a punishment for the body's

## The Beginning
**The Essence of the Sūktas**: The state of being bound by karma, a state that is unnatural and distorted, and its signs.

**(633)** Just as the imbalance of the bodily elements manifests as disease, so too does the imbalance of the soul's inherent elements manifest as the disease of karma. Just as disease has specific causes, so too does the disease of karma. Just as the accumulation of impurities, the aggravation of karmic poisons, the imbalance of bodily elements, conduct contrary to nature, fear, and anxiety, etc., lead to the manifestation of disease, so too does the accumulation of karmic impurities, the aggravation of karmic poisons like attachment, aversion, and delusion, the imbalance of the soul's inherent elements, conduct contrary to the soul's inherent nature - adharma, the fear of the consequences of one's actions, and the anxiety of not being on the right path, etc., lead to the manifestation of the great disease of karma.

**(1)** Just as disease leads to a weakening of the digestive fire, causing a loss of appetite and a dislike for food, so too does the disease of karma lead to a weakening of the soul's inherent energy, causing a loss of appetite for the path of liberation and a dislike for the supreme reality. Just as disease leads to vomiting, a sign of the body's rejection of the disease, so too does the disease of karma lead to a rejection of the path of liberation and a forgetting of one's true nature. Just as disease leads to constipation or indigestion, so too does the disease of karma lead to the accumulation of karmic impurities or the indigestion of worldly desires.

**(2)** Just as disease causes pain in the heart and shortness of breath, so too does the disease of karma cause pain to the soul and shortness of breath in the pursuit of the right path.

**(3)** Just as disease leads to an increase in vital energy, causing rapid breathing, coughing, and phlegm, so too does the disease of karma lead to an obstruction of the soul's inherent knowledge and vision, causing rapid breathing of birth and death, coughing of karmic poisons, and phlegm of worldly desires.

**(4)** Just as disease leads to the decay and depletion of the body, so too does the disease of karma lead to the decay and depletion of the soul's knowledge body.

**(5)** Just as disease disrupts the flow of pure blood in the body, causing the body to become pale, weak, and lifeless, so too does the disease of karma disrupt the flow of pure consciousness, causing the soul's knowledge body to become pale, weak, and lifeless.

**(6)** Just as disease dries up the bodily elements like blood and flesh, leaving only bones, so too does the disease of karma dry up the soul's inherent elements like knowledge and vision, leaving only a faint trace of consciousness.

**(7)** Just as disease can affect the brain, causing confusion, loss of memory, and incoherent speech, so too does the disease of karma affect the soul, causing confusion, loss of memory, and incoherent speech.

The collection of impurities (gaderisamuccaya) does not reside in the form of the three poisons (tridosha), the center of the form is shifted due to the corruption of the form, the soul forgets its inherent nature (nijaswaroop) of the father, the insane one becomes a "chakra" and speaks nonsense about the other things as if they were the father, and due to the growth of the three poisons (mehraag-dvesharoopi trideesha), it attains the state of annihilation (nipataroop) from the state of existence (saswaroop). (8) Just as the body itches and burns due to the heat, similarly, due to the disease of existence (bhavarog), the body itches and burns due to the desire for enjoyment (bhogechchaaroop). (9) Just as the body gets fever and thirst due to the heat, similarly, due to the disease of existence (bhavarog), the soul gets fever and thirst due to the desire for objects (vishayatrushna). (10) Just as various ailments arise due to the heat, similarly, birth, death, etc. arise due to the disease of existence (bhavarog). To be born again and again, to die again and again, to lie in the womb of the mother again and again, to experience old age, heat, pain, anxiety, misfortune, poverty, etc. again and again - these are all the ailments of the disease of existence (bhavarog).
(11) Just as strange types of affection arise due to the heat, similarly, strange types of affection arise due to the disease of existence (bhavarog). Just as the disease of jaundice (kamala) causes the yellowness of the eyes, similarly, the disease of existence (bhavarog) causes the delusion of perception (darshanmoh) due to the strange affection of the wrong belief (mithyatva). Just as the patient with fever forgets his own identity, similarly, the soul in the disease of existence (bhavarog) does not have the awareness of its own true nature. Just as the patient in unconsciousness considers the father's things as his own and his own things as others, similarly, the soul in the disease of existence (bhavarog) considers the other things as the father's and its own things as others. (12) Just as the patient is not in his original healthy state but in a diseased and distorted state, similarly, the soul in the disease of existence (bhavarog) is not in its original natural state but in a distorted state due to the disease of existence (bhavarog). (13) Just as the behavior of the patient suffering from fever is erratic, similarly, the behavior of the soul suffering from the disease of existence (bhavarog) is also erratic and contrary to its nature. (14) Just as the patient becomes irritable due to the heat, similarly, the soul in the disease of existence (bhavarog) also becomes irritable and gets angry. (15) Just as the body experiences intense pain due to the disease, similarly, the soul experiences intense pain due to the attachment to women, etc. - thus, from certain specific signs...

(635) Just as a diagnosis can be made based on examining the symptoms of a disease, the diagnosis of Bhava Rog can be made based on the subtle, specific signs.

And just as the curability, difficulty to cure, or incurability of a disease can be determined based on the condition of the patient and the type of disease, the curability, difficulty to cure, or incurability of Bhava Rog can be determined based on the state of the being, the type of Bhava, and the specific circumstances. Is this being's Bhava Rog curable, difficult to cure, or incurable? This can be determined through a Prognosis. For example:

(1) If a patient experiences a very positive effect from a medicine immediately, it indicates that the disease is curable. Similarly, if a being experiences a very positive effect, in the form of a change in their Bhava, immediately after the application of the appropriate medicine, such as Samyag Darshan, it is certain that the being is close to liberation and their Bhava Rog is curable.

(2) If a patient experiences some effect from a medicine after a long time, it indicates that the disease is difficult to cure. Similarly, if a being experiences a positive effect, in the form of a change in their Bhava, after a long time of applying the medicine of the Ratna Trayi, it indicates that the being is far from liberation and their Bhava Rog is difficult to cure.

(3) If a patient does not experience any effect from any medicine, even after a very long time, and the medicine has no effect, it is like pouring water on a stone, and the disease worsens, it indicates that the disease is incurable. Similarly, if a being does not experience any positive effect, in the form of a change in their Bhava, even after a long time of applying the best medicines, such as Darshan, and does not experience any improvement, and instead experiences negative effects like pride, it indicates that the being is far from liberation and their Bhava Rog is incurable.

Just as the future outcome of a disease can be predicted based on the symptoms and specific circumstances of the patient, the future outcome of Bhava Rog can be predicted based on the signs and specific circumstances of the being.

Furthermore, just as there are differences among patients, some are intelligent, some are not, some are children, some are old, etc., there are also differences among beings with Bhava Rog. Some are intelligent, some are not, some are children, some are old, etc. Because, as mentioned above, the one who understands the painful nature of the disease, the intelligent and wise patient, will try to cure the disease as quickly as possible.

Yagadi Samuchaya

A wise, discerning person who is afflicted with raga (passion) seeks refuge in a skilled physician, and without discarding his own wisdom, he follows the physician's instructions and takes the prescribed medicine, thereby becoming free from raga. Similarly, a wise, discerning, learned soul who has attained right understanding seeks refuge in a knowledgeable physician in the form of a Sadguru, and discarding his own mental speculations and whims, he takes the medicine of the Ratnatraya according to the instructions of the Sadguru, and thus becomes free from the raga of rebirth. But a foolish, undiscerning person who is attached to wrong practices, like a camel owner who is attracted by sweet-talking, incompetent quacks, falls prey to their deceitful treatment and suffers further, remaining bound by raga. Similarly, a childish, ignorant soul who is attached to worldly pleasures, seeks refuge in a false guru who speaks sweet words that appear appealing at first but are actually poisonous in their consequences, and through the incompetent remedies of this inept physician, he falls deeper into the abyss of rebirth and remains bound by raga. And so on, there are different types of people afflicted by raga, and even among them, there are differences in the prognosis of the severity and curability of raga.

Just as raga can be controlled and cured through appropriate treatment, so too can the raga of rebirth be controlled and cured through appropriate treatment. In the treatment of raga, just as there is a need for a skilled, expert physician who truly understands the root cause, the reason, the form, the signs, the consequences, and the treatment of raga, so too in the treatment of the raga of rebirth, there is an indispensable need for a knowledgeable, wise Sadguru who truly understands the root cause, the reason, the form, the signs, the consequences, and the preventive treatment of the raga of rebirth. Just as there is a need for excellent medicine in the prevention of disease, so too there is a need for the medicine of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct in the prevention of the raga of rebirth. Just as taking the right medicine with the right diet is beneficial and leads to healing, while taking it without the right diet is harmful, so too taking the medicine of the Ratnatraya with the right diet of following the guru's instructions is beneficial and leads to liberation, while taking it without the right diet is harmful and leads to spiritual downfall. The supreme seer, Shrimad Rajchandraji, has said:

"Raga is like self-delusion, the Sadguru is the knowledgeable physician;
Following the guru's instructions is like the right diet, the medicine is contemplation and meditation." - Shri Atmasiddhi

And thus, just as a person afflicted with raga becomes healthy through appropriate treatment, so too...

## The Essence of the Poison: The Variety, Treatment, and Why it is Called "Maha" (Great)

(637)

**Health**

When the poison is eradicated through the proper use of the three jewels (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct) as medicine, the being becomes free from the poison, healthy, free from disease, and nourished by the pure essence of consciousness. It experiences the ultimate state of health, immersed in the bliss of its true nature. In many ways, the poison can be compared to passion, so it is fitting to call it by that name. This is a brief overview, as much as possible. You should understand it more deeply through your own reflection.

**6**

Furthermore, calling this poison "Maha" (Great) is also justified. Because whatever is the best in its own category or class is called "Maha. For example, Maha-kavi (great poet), Maha-raja (great king), Maha-vir (great hero), Maha-muni (great sage). The poison's greatness is evident in many ways. For example:

(1) The passions that arise in a human body last for a limited time, or at most, for the duration of this life. But this poison has been affecting this being since time immemorial, and it continues to torment it even now. Thus, due to its extreme duration, this poison is "Maha."

(2) Although the passions that manifest in the human body cause intense suffering, the suffering caused by the poison in the hellish realms (see Gatha, page 202, footnote) is so intense that no other suffering can compare to it. The physical and mental suffering caused by passion is nothing compared to the infinite physical and mental suffering caused by the poison in the form of disease, affliction, and obstacles. In the four realms of existence, one endures endless suffering from birth and death. Thus, due to its intensity, the poison is also "Maha."

(3) It is not very difficult to cure or alleviate ordinary passions, but curing or alleviating this poison is extremely difficult. Therefore, due to its difficulty or even impossibility to cure, this poison is "Maha."

(4) Intense passion may lead to death once, but this intense poison leads to endless cycles of birth and death. Thus, due to its consequences, this poison is also "Maha."

**Why is it called "Maha" (Great)?**

In these and other ways, this world of suffering is truly a great poison. To overcome it, the wise must become determined, exert themselves, and make every effort with all their being. How much effort does a sick person make to cure a common illness in this fleeting life? What lengths do they go to? How many doctors and healers do they consult? 

Page #714:
---------------------------
(38)
What collection of yogic perspectives does one gather? How much is spent on medicines and other things? After that, why doesn't the soul, being a seeker of liberation, make as much effort to overcome this eternal, great disease? Why doesn't one make unprecedented self-effort? Why doesn't one expend all the power of one's father's body, mind, wealth, and word? Why doesn't one drink the supreme nectar of the three jewels with utmost love? Why doesn't one follow the prescribed regimen of the true Guru with utmost enthusiasm?
मुख्योऽयमात्मनोऽनादिचित्रकर्मनिदानजः । तथानुभवसिद्धत्वात्सर्वप्राणभृतामिति ॥१८९॥ This is the main disease that arises for the soul, born from the cause of eternal, variegated karma. It is experienced and proven by all living beings. 189
Meaning - This bhavyadhi is the main disease for the soul, it is truly incurable. And it is born from the cause of strange karma, which is different from the distinction of substance and quality, because it is experienced and proven by all beings in the same way.
Discussion - This bhavyadhi, which is for the soul, is the main one, it is truly incurable. And it is born from the power of strange karma, which is different from the distinction of substance and quality, because it is experienced and proven by all beings, including the tiryanch, through the direct experience of birth, death, and other changes.
The bhavyadhi mentioned above is not imaginary, it is not fictional, it is not merely a statement of treatment, but it is real, it is the main one,
It is truly transcendental. It is not a wave of bhavyadhi, a poetic imagination, it is not imagined, but it is the real state of affairs, the true reality, the main transcendence (Actual Fact, Reality). Because what is truly transcendental, truly incurable, is called "main". And the treatment also
It can only be the main, transcendental, true thing, not otherwise. If there were no such thing as bhavarupa, then it could not be treated as a disease. But bhavarupa
Vritti: -mu: -main, incurable, -this, bhavyadhi named - the soul, the soul, what kind? So - anariritrivaarbaninad - eternal, such a strange karma-like cause, born from, different from the distinction of substance and quality, such karma-born, that is the meaning. Due to what cause? That is - tathaanu bhavasiddhatvaan - such experience-provenness, due to the experience of birth, etc. Sarvakagmitamiti - all beings, - tiyyay pramukh, too.

## Makttavami-Mansa: Love-Disease, the Primary Goal, Eternal

(639) It is indeed the true state of affairs, the nature of things, and therefore it can be treated as a disease. The disease may be a metaphor, a concept, a treatment, but "birth" is not a metaphor, a concept, or a treatment. Birth is the true reality (Absolute reality), an untreatable event, the primary goal, the essential state of affairs. It is the primary "chati" (manifest) thing, and this metaphorical event-treatment narrative is to understand it truly. And this treatment-like behavior also occurs in the best interests of the primary goal, the essential thing. For example, there is the existence of a real disease, and it can be treated metaphorically, there is the existence of a real lion, and the "lion-man" - the cat is treated as a metaphor for the lion, the man-lion is treated, but if it did not exist, then what treatment could it be? For example, the existence of a "vadhyasut" (a mythical creature), or a "akashpushp" (a flower that grows in the sky), or a "shashshanga" (a mythical creature) does not exist, so it is not possible to treat them.

This birth is born from a strange karma-like cause, which is eternal. According to the eternal law, every action must have a cause, so there must be a cause for the action of birth. Just as a disease arises from a specific cause, so too does this birth arise from a strange karma-like cause, different from the material and mental distinctions. And this karma-like cause is eternal. Therefore, this karma is eternally connected to this soul, bound by the relationship of association. This pairing of nature and soul is eternal, just as the association of gold and stone, or the association of army and soil is eternal.

"Just as gold is naturally associated with the earth, so too is the soul eternally associated with karma. The soul is called a worldly being as long as it is associated with karma." - Shri Anandghanji.

"The association of the inert and the conscious is eternal, infinite, and without a doer. This is what the Jina Bhagvant says." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

If we do not accept this eternal association of karma and soul, then there is a contradiction. If we accept karma as the first, then who did the karma without the soul? And who did it attach to? If we accept the pure soul as the first, then what is the purpose of karma attaching to the pure soul? And if we accept that it attaches, then why wouldn't it attach to the pure, liberated soul? Again, which came first, the chicken or the egg? Which came first, the tree or the seed? 

"Treatment is also often done in the world, primarily for the sake of the main thing. All this is just a fabrication." - Shri Gibindu, Shle, 15. 

Page #716:
---------------------------
(640)
Just as the yogic perspective on the origin of the universe cannot be definitively stated and is considered to be beginningless, similarly, the relationship between karma and the soul is also established as beginningless.
“Which came first, the soul or karma? – Both are beginningless. If the soul came first, then there would need to be a reason for it to become entangled with the pure substance. If you say karma came first, then who performed karma without the soul? By this logic, both are beginningless.” - Shrimad Rajchandra’s Shri Moksha Mala.
This beginningless karma is unique – it is of many types, and it is divided into material and mental aspects. Material karma is in the form of pudgala particles, and mental karma is in the form of the soul’s results. Attachment, aversion, and delusion are the impure results of the soul, and these are mental karma. The eight karmas, such as knowledge obscuration, are material karma. The general understanding of these eight karmas is as follows:
Knowledge obscuration is the covering of the soul’s infinite power related to knowledge. Perception obscuration is the covering of the soul’s infinite power of perception. Vedaniya karma is the two types of vedaniya karma, pleasant and unpleasant, caused by the body, which obstruct the soul’s power of uninterrupted happiness. Mehniya karma is the obstruction of the soul’s power of self-conduct. Ayu karma is the obstruction of the soul’s power of indestructible existence. Nama karma is the obstruction of the soul’s power of formless divine qualities. Gotra karma is the obstruction of the soul’s power of unwavering awareness. Antaray karma is the obstruction of the soul’s infinite power of giving, receiving, effort, gathering, and consumption.”
– Shri Moksha Mala, page 102.
These eight fundamental types of karma have further numerous subdivisions. And there are four types of bondage of karma: nature bondage, state bondage, taste bondage, and region bondage. State bondage and taste bondage are caused by passions, and nature bondage and region bondage are caused by the actions of the mind, speech, and body. The bondage, arising, manifestation, power, karma-severance, destructive, and non-destructive aspects of these karmas, and many other subtle aspects, are worthy of understanding by the seeker of truth through the great scriptures like Karma Granth, Panchaadhyayee, Gomsar, etc.
Padma Prabhu Jin! You and I, what is the difference, O Lord? Karma’s results are the reason, some say, wise Padma, a particle from a region, the root has many subdivisions; destructive, non-destructive, bondage, arising, manifestation, power, karma-severance… Padma” – Shri Anandghanji. x" योग्यतामन्तरेणास्य संयोगोऽपि न युज्यते।
That is the truth, my friend, like the waves of the ocean.” – Shri Yogakhindhu Play, 10.

## Muktatvamimansa: The Interplay of Dravyakarma and Bhavakarma

(641) There is a mutual cause-and-effect relationship between Bhavakarma and Dravyakarma. The generation of Dravyakarma, such as Jnanavaraniya, arises due to Bhavakarma, like Raga, etc. Conversely, the generation of Bhavakarma, like Raga, etc., arises due to Dravyakarma. Thus, a vicious circle of Dravyakarma and Bhavakarma continues, perpetuating the cycle of karma. This vicious circle can be broken by stopping Bhavakarma, like Raga, etc., which is like applying brakes to a motor. This is within the control of the soul. Once this vicious cycle is broken, the cycle of karma stops, and consequently, the cycle of birth and death also stops. This intricate relationship is elaborated in various scriptures like Shri Samyatsar, Pravachansar, etc., which should be deeply contemplated by the seeker.

**Diagram: 15**

**Bhavakarma**
**Karma Chakra**
**Bhav Chakra**
**Dravyakarma**

If someone asks for proof of this Bhavavyaadhi, which is the main cause of suffering and is generated by the endless cycle of karma, the simple and accurate answer is that it is experienced by all beings. This is a strong and direct proof based on experience. All beings, including Tiryanchas, experience this Bhavavyaadhi in various ways. They suffer the great pain of birth, aging, death, disease, sorrow, and fear. This Bhavavyaadhi, which causes birth and death, is not a mere imagination but a reality experienced by all. It is a proven fact, and there is no need for further proof.

Even though one is freed from this, the freed one is still the main one; (because) the birth-related defects are removed, and the absence of defects is its consequence. 190
Meaning - And even though one is freed from this Bhavyadhi, the freed one is still the main one, because the removal of birth-related defects leads to the absence of defects.
Discussion - The "Susya" mentioned above, the one who is freed from Bhavyadhi, even the freed-siddh is still the main one, because there is a feeling of activity-cause. That is, because of the cause of the removal of birth-related defects, there is a consequence of the absence of defects - a diminishing nature.
The Bhava-Vyadhi, which was proven to be the main-nirupcharit, even the freed-siddh from Bhava-Vyadhi is still the main one, nirupcharit, the true Dharma.
Because the activity-cause - in that way, the activity-cause, which is the main freed one, the action is also the main one, this is the rule. And here, the birth-related defects are the main cause of removal, so the action of being freed is also the main one. And thus, the removal of birth-related defects leads to the consequence of the absence of defects. Because a diseased person is called aroga when he is freed from the disease,
Kritti-patbhu - And the one who is freed from this Bhavyadhi, the one who is freed from the freed-one, the siddh, the one who has the value of nourishment - is still the main one, is still the main

Muktatvamimansa: Mukta (liberated) is the primary, adosha (without faults) due to the absence of desha (faults). 

Just as a man afflicted with birth, death, etc., faults, is called "adosha" when he is freed from those faults, similarly, the absence of faults, which is the cause of the disappearance of faults, is the primary reason for being "mukta". 

The meaning is that when a disease is destroyed, the man is not destroyed, but the disease-free man has only good qualities. Similarly, when the disease of birth and death is destroyed, the man-soul is not destroyed, but the liberated soul has only good qualities. 

Just as a person who is afflicted with faults becomes faultless when those faults are absent, similarly, this soul, which is afflicted with birth, death, etc., faults, becomes a liberated soul when those faults are absent. But the absence of faults does not mean that the faultless person is absent, just as the absence of birth, death, etc., faults does not mean that the faultless soul is absent. 

Just as faultlessness is the state of a person being free from faults, but the person is not absent, similarly, liberation, which is faultlessness, is the state of the soul being free from birth, death, etc., faults, but the soul is not absent. 

Just as a healthy man remains after the disease is gone, similarly, a pure soul remains after the disease of birth and death is gone.

Explaining the same meaning, it is said:

"Even though there is a suppression of the nature of the soul, due to the connection with its own nature, it is the same soul that is present. Because of the absence of that, there is a connection with faultlessness." (191)

Meaning: Even though there is a suppression of the nature of the soul, due to the connection with its own nature, it is the same soul that is present. Because of the absence of that, there is a connection with faultlessness. 

"Just as a man does not consider himself destroyed when his body is destroyed, similarly, the soul is not destroyed." - Shri Samadhishatak.

Yoga-darsti-samuchaya meaning - Although the soul's nature is obscured, due to the force of its inherent nature, it is connected to its own true nature, and because of this, it is connected to its non-destruction.
Commentary - Although the soul's nature is obscured, due to the removal of the feeling of birth, etc., it is connected to its inherent nature; and therefore, it has "tatha-bhava" in the past, meaning it is connected to its non-destruction. In other words, the deluded one is less likely to attain non-destruction.
From time immemorial, the soul's nature has been obscured - it has been covered with dirt. Due to the attack of the mind, its nature has been obscured, suppressed, surrounded,
covered, but not fundamentally destroyed. The nature of the knowledge-nature of the true form is obscured by the separation from the dharma-like nature of the feet - the nature of the feet - or it is attached to the adharma-like mind, but the nature of the object, which is its own nature, is never fundamentally absent. It only happens that it is obscured - covered - by the consciousness that follows the mind. In other words, the soul followed the mind-like mountain, so it was obscured by karma. The nature-like "self-dharma" was abandoned, and it followed the mind-like "other dharma." Therefore, due to the attachment of the past in the form of karma, the other dharma made it truly "fearful" by causing it to wander in the world and suffer! "Other dharmas" are created by the mind, which is also accidental, meaning it is produced by a cause, and is therefore eternal from the beginning, and the cause-like "other effect" is subject-object-related, and is therefore finite. Thus, the mind-like adharma arises from the cause of the other effect, which is the object, etc., and therefore the soul, corrupted by the pure nature-like dharma, wanders in the world and becomes the doer of the other effect. Thus, the soul's nature is obscured - covered with dirt - by the other effect - the mind. (See page 494).
"The nature of the object, its own nature, is never fundamentally absent; it is only obscured by the consciousness that follows the mind." - Shri Devchandraji. "The consciousness that is in its own awareness, the doer, does not act in its own awareness, the doer, the effect." - Shri Atmasiddhi.
Just as the attack of the outer wheel causes chaos in the city, confusion spreads, self and other are not distinguished, and the kingdom of fear spreads everywhere due to anarchy, so the attack of the outer wheel in the form of the mind causes

## The Essence of the Devotee:

This discourse on the nature of the devotee, the essence of the self, and its limitations, is a profound exploration of Jain philosophy. It emphasizes the inherent nature of the soul, its pure and unadulterated essence, and the limitations imposed by its interactions with the world.

The soul's true nature is its inherent essence, its pure and unadulterated self. This essence is the soul's true abode, its inherent being. This inherent nature is the soul's "svabhaav" (nature). (See footnote on page 75).

This "svabhaav" is limited by the soul's "bhaav" (emotions). The extent of the soul's "bhaav" determines the extent of its "svabhaav." It is not otherwise.

To exist and function in pure consciousness is the soul's "svabhaav-maryada" (natural limitation). This "svabhaav" is its "maryada dharma" (limitation-based dharma). Therefore, to exist in pure consciousness is to be within one's "svabhaav." To exist in any other "bhaav" is not to be within one's "svabhaav."

Because the soul's "svabhaav" is limited to pure consciousness, to exist in any other "bhaav" is to be outside of its "svabhaav." To say otherwise would be a fallacy, because the pure essence of the soul is its "svabhaav," and any other form is not its "svabhaav" but a "vibhaav" (external influence).

In essence, to exist within the limitations of one's "svabhaav," to function according to one's true essence, to remain in one's true nature, is the essence of the soul. To exist outside of these limitations, to function outside of one's true essence, is not "svabhaav" but "vibhaav."

To exist within one's "svabhaav" is to be free from all faults, to be liberated. To exist in one's true essence, to be free from all external influences, is to be pure and perfect, to be in a state of infinite virtues. This is the state of "devachandra" (the perfect being), the state of the "jinaraaj" (the victorious king).

"Devachandra" is the embodiment of this pure and perfect state, the state of infinite virtues. He is the one who has attained this state of liberation, the state of pure consciousness, the state of "svabhaav."

The text then goes on to discuss the concept of "anantarakshanamutiratmamud" (the absence of the soul in the past and future moments). This concept is explained in detail, emphasizing the eternal nature of the soul and its existence beyond the limitations of time.

The text concludes by highlighting the importance of understanding the true nature of the soul and its limitations. It emphasizes the need to strive for liberation, to attain the state of "svabhaav," and to become like "devachandra," the embodiment of pure consciousness and infinite virtues.

Yoga Disamuccaya
Meaning: - In the immediate moment, the one who is considered to be the self (by the Vaamanavadi) is not real, and with that, he is eternally present, or he is always unreal.
Discussion
Anantar, meaning the previous and subsequent moments, is non-existence, non-being. The one who, according to the Vaamanavadi's opinion, is considered to be the self, meaning the one who believes that the soul is not real in the previous and subsequent moments, but only real in the present moment, has many faults. He has no connection with the previous and subsequent moments of non-existence, therefore his present moment (1) should be eternal, and (2) or it should always be unreal, non-existent - this is the argument here. Both these arguments are flawed, and therefore the theory of momentariness is established. It is like this: -
.
(1) The momentarist believes that - the soul and other things are momentary, they are non-existent, unreal in the previous and subsequent moments, and only real, existent in the present moment. If we apply this to the momentarist's own soul, it becomes clear: - Due to the lack of connection with his belief that there is non-existence in the previous and subsequent moments, he himself exists in the present moment. Because he says that he is not real in the previous and subsequent moments, he accepts his existence, his present moment, in the moment between them. Thus, the one who is real in the present moment should be eternal, because it is a rule that whatever is real, is always real due to its reality. Meaning, whatever is real, should always be real. So, the one who is real in the present moment should always be real in the present moment. Meaning, he should be eternal. And thus, by establishing the eternal argument, momentariness is destroyed. (2) Moreover, the one who knows and says that there is non-existence in the previous and subsequent moments, if he himself is not real in the previous and subsequent moments, then how can he know and speak? So, he himself should be real in the previous and subsequent moments, in the present moment in which he is real. Thus, it is experienced that the one who knows that something is momentary is not momentary himself. (See page 81, the verses of Atmasiddhi). So, the soul is not momentary, but eternal. - Therefore, the arguer should either accept the eternal argument, or he should abandon the argument that he is real in the present moment. And if he does that, he will always be unreal, non-existent! Because according to them, he is unreal in the previous and subsequent moments, and if he is not real in the present moment, then he will always be unreal, non-existent.
Is the arguer not momentary?

---------------------------
## The Refutation of Momentarism by Its Own Logic:

**(649)** Even in the present moment, it does not remain as it is, and the momentarists who claim this, their father's existence would not remain! So, from where would their argument arise? Those who believe in the absence of the soul in the previous and subsequent moments, their momentarism cannot stand even for a moment.

To counter the objection, it is said:

"It is not the same, just as it is not otherwise. It is contradictory by its own logic, because of its origin and so on." (194)

**Meaning:** "It is not the same" - this is contradictory to "it is otherwise", just as it is contradictory by its own logic, because of its origin and so on.

**Analysis:** "It is the same" - this indicates the state of being. "It is not" - this indicates the state of non-being. Therefore, "it is not the same" is contradictory to "it is otherwise". It is contradictory by its own logic, because the momentarists say, "It is otherwise - it is not otherwise - it becomes", and they say, "How can it be otherwise, if it is otherwise? How can it be?" And this logic is the same in "it is not the same". It is contradictory in this way - if it is the same, how can it "be not"? How can it not be? And if it "is" - it is not, how can it "be"? This is contradictory. Because of the absence of origin and so on, it is contradictory in this way.

**Explanation:** "It is the same" - this is the indication of the state of being, and "it is not" - this is the indication of the state of non-being. "It is otherwise" - this is the indication of the state of being otherwise. It is contradictory, it is refuted, by its own logic, because it says, "How can it be otherwise? If it is otherwise, then how can it be?" And this "it is not the same" - here also, it is the same. It is contradictory in this way - if it is the same, how can it "be not"? How can it not be, because of the absence of being? It is contradictory in this way.

The commentary says: "Because of its origin and so on, because of the absence of origin and so on, it is contradictory in this way."

Feeling ?
Here, the momentary [Kshanika Vadi] uses the same tactic to support his own opinion, with which the sage, the master of Nyaya Shastra, refutes the momentary opinion with great skill, like a skilled lawyer, and returns the argument of the proponent to the proponent's mouth. Then, by the same justice, he has no choice but to remain silent. In this way, the refutation of the momentary [Kshanika Vadi] is that the feeling that exists in one moment, in the next moment, transforms into something else—'it becomes something else,' he says. Then the momentary [Kshanika Vadi] argues in this way to refute it—'How can it become something else? If it becomes something else, how can it become something else? That is, how can that feeling become something else? And how can the feeling that is something else become something else? Therefore, 'it becomes something else'—that feeling becomes something else, it does not happen.' Now, by the same justice, believing that what exists in the previous and next moment does not exist in the present moment, 'the same is not'—what the momentary [Kshanika Vadi] says, that also does not happen. Because 'the same' shows the feeling of being, and 'not being' shows the absence of not being. Thus, in one place, feeling and absence are mutually opposed. Because the same feeling is, how can it 'not be'—how can it not be? And if it is 'not being'—'not being', then how can it be feeling? That is, if 'feeling' is, how can it 'not be'? And if 'not being' is, how can it be 'feeling'? Thus, this is contradictory. Therefore, the momentary side of 'it is not the same' does not happen.
Moreover, the momentary [Kshanika Vadi] accepts that the feeling exists only in the present moment, but he says that in the previous and next moment, it 'does not be'—it does not exist—it is absence. There are also many contradictions in this; because if it does not exist in the previous moment, it exists in the present moment, that is, the feeling arises from absence, this is a fault. Similarly, if it does not exist in the next moment, then there is destruction of being, that is, the manifestation of the feeling is a fault. And so on, many such contradictions arise. (See Shloka. 嗡
Asat is produced, it exists in the present moment, it becomes absence, this is also a fault. (See P. 81 of the Fruitnet.)
Vritti: -Sato—being, feeling, asattva—being considered as non-being (from the word 'the same is not'). What? Then kesavutsah—its production, that is, the production of asattva, will happen—due to kadachitkapana (due to the possibility of being). Then—therefore, due to that production, nashopi tattva—that asattva will also be destroyed.

## Muktatattvamimamsa: Defects in the Theory of Annihilation (Kshanikavada)

(651) If the nature of Sat (being) is considered to be Asat (non-being), then Asat will be produced, and therefore it will also be destroyed. Consequently, the destroyed Asat will be reborn, or else it will be constantly destroyed, and there will be no state of existence for it.

**Explanation:**

The statement "It is not" implies that Sat is considered to be Asat, meaning the absence of being. Due to the occasional existence of Asat, it will be produced, and due to this production, it will also be destroyed, because "Whatever is produced is impermanent." Therefore, the destroyed Asat will be reborn in the same form, because there is no other possibility for the destruction of Asat. In other words, there is no other way for it to be destroyed.

Now, if someone argues that destruction is only a state of being before and after the destruction-causing factor, then this is a misconception. The constant destruction that is assumed will not have any state of existence, and it will be destroyed even at the desired moment.

Based on the statement "It is not," the nature of Sat is considered to be Asat, meaning the absence of being. This will lead to the production of Asat, the emergence of absence. Therefore, something that does not exist in the first place cannot be produced, being cannot arise from non-being, and the world cannot be created from nothing! It is like saying that Asat will spontaneously appear in the sky like a sky flower, a hare's horn, or a barren woman's child, which does not exist! This production of Asat is directly contradicted and is flawed in many ways.

(1) Even if we assume that Asat is produced, it will be destroyed along with its production. Because whatever is produced is also destroyed, this is a rule. Therefore, Asat will be destroyed, and it will vanish. Consequently, the destroyed Asat will be reborn in the same form, because the destruction of Asat is "Vahoottimattanatya," meaning whatever is produced is impermanent. Therefore, the destroyed Asat will be reborn in the same form, because there is no other possibility for the destruction of Asat. In other words, there is no other way for it to be destroyed. Now, if someone argues that destruction is only a state of being before and after the destruction-causing factor, then this is a misconception. The constant destruction that is assumed will not have any state of existence, and it will be destroyed even at the desired moment. 

Page #728:
---------------------------
(52)
How else will the collection of yogas not diminish? Thus, being will remain, truth will remain, the object will always be proven to be of the nature of being, therefore, the untruth of being that you have believed is inappropriate - it is false. (2) Therefore, the debater caught in the trap, confused, holding onto the side of the destruction of being, says that due to the destructive feeling, we also believe that destruction is in the previous and subsequent moments. Then, the answer is given: there will not be a state of always believing in destruction. You say that even in the desired moment, it will not exist, therefore, the being that you believe in will always become non-being. Thus, by believing in the non-being of being, (1) non-being will be produced - the feeling of absence will arise, (2) therefore, non-being will be destroyed, meaning the feeling of absence will be absent, (3) therefore, the feeling will be reborn in the same form. Meaning, the feeling will be the feeling, the object will always be proven to be of the nature of feeling. Or - by believing in the destruction of being, the object will always be proven to be of the nature of absence, therefore, it will never exist.

## The Doctrine of Existence: Either Eternal Existence or Eternal Non-Existence

**(53)** In the previous chapter, it was stated that if a thing is considered to be eternally destroyed, then it cannot even exist for a moment. Therefore, the momentarists argue that destruction is a characteristic of momentary existence.

In response, the scholars state: (1) Even in the subsequent moments, the characteristic of momentary existence, which you claim, will cease to exist. Therefore, in the subsequent moments, this characteristic of momentary existence will arise again. Thus, the eternal non-existence will continue for an infinite number of moments. After that, what moment will be devoid of the characteristic of momentary existence? Show that. In other words, an eternal state of existence in all three times will be attained. Thus, when the uninterrupted existence of a thing is established, where will the momentariness remain? (2) Or, if you say that destruction, which has the characteristic of momentary existence, will exist for a moment, then in the subsequent moments, that destruction with the characteristic of momentary existence will be attained. Therefore, tell me, what moment will be devoid of the destruction that you believe has the characteristic of momentary existence? There will not be a single moment when destruction does not exist, meaning that destruction will always be attained, and the thing will not exist even for a moment. Thus, either eternal existence will be attained, or eternal non-existence will be attained. Therefore, in any case, your momentarism will not stand even for a moment. And thus, what was said above is all correct, and it is confirmed here.

How? It is said:

**क्षणस्थितौ तदैवास्य नास्थितियुक्त्यसंगतेः । न पश्चादपि सेत्येवं सतेोऽसत्त्वं व्यवस्थितम् ॥ १९७॥**

**kshaṇasthitau tadaiva asya nāstiti yuktyasangateḥ | na paścādapi seti evam satō'sattvaṁ vyavasthitam || 197 ||**

**Meaning:** When there is momentary existence, then there is no non-existence of the intended object, due to the inconsistency of the logic. And even later, there is no non-existence. Thus, the non-existence of existence is established.

**Explanation:** When there is momentary existence, then there is no non-existence of the intended object at that moment, due to the inconsistency of the logic. And even later, there is no non-existence. Thus, the non-existence of existence is established.

**Commentary:** When there is momentary existence, then there is no non-existence of the intended object at that moment, due to the inconsistency of the logic. And even later, there is no non-existence. Thus, the non-existence of existence is established.

The sutra states that the non-existence of existence is established. And therefore, the production, etc., of existence is also non-existent. 

Page #730:

(654)
Yogadi Samuchaya
Dai; because if it is not, then there is a contradiction to the state of being, so the logic is inconsistent. Even then, in the second moment, it is not the state of being. Hai, because of the intended initial inconsistency of the logic. 'Then there is a contradiction to its state of being in the state of being' - because the logic is inconsistent in this way that it is not the state of being in the moment. In this way, existence and non-existence are arranged. And therefore, in summary, the conclusion is: 'Existence, non-existence, being, its production, etc. are all that follows.'
In the previous section, it was said that there are those who have the dharma of the moment of destruction, etc., and this is clarified here. (1) When there is a moment of feeling, then - at a certain intended moment, there will not be a state of being of that intended feeling, i.e., there will only be a state of being. Because if it is not, then the logic becomes inconsistent. When there is a state of being, there is a contradiction to the state of non-being, i.e., the logic is that when there is a state of being, there is no state of non-being, and that does not happen. So, if something has the dharma of the moment, then there must be a state of being of the intended feeling at the intended moment. (2) And even then, in the next moment, there is no state of being of it, because if it is not, then the logic becomes inconsistent; 'Then there is a contradiction to the state of being in the state of non-being' - this is the logic, and it becomes inconsistent; i.e., when there is a state of non-being, there is no state of being, this is the logic, and it does not happen here - so, even in the next moment, there is no state of being of the present feeling, but only a state of being. It should be understood in this way for the past and future moments. The state of being means that the three-time state of being of the present feeling is established - thus, it is proven that all that was said about existence, non-existence, being, non-existence, production, etc. is indeed true. So, the non-existence of the momentary form of existence, which the momentarists believe in, is established; i.e., the non-being, the falseness, the delusion is proven. Thus, the momentarist view is false.
। इति एकान्त अनित्यपक्ष निराकरणम् ।
It says, taking the eternal view as the basis -
भवभावा निवृत्तावप्ययुक्ता मुक्तकल्पना । एकान्तैकस्वभावस्य न ह्यवस्थाद्वयं क्वचित् ॥ १९८ ॥
If there is no more becoming and non-becoming, then the idea of liberation is not appropriate... because, for that which is eternally one in nature, there is never a duality of states. 198
Commentary:- Even in the non-cessation of becoming and non-becoming, even in eternal existence, what? Then - the idea of liberation of the soul is inappropriate. Why is it inappropriate? Because - it is eternally one in nature - because of the contradiction of the eternal one nature - because it is not, it goes away - the state of being - the worldly and the liberated, the mind - never, because of the contradiction of the eternal one nature.

**Meaning:** Even in the absence of worldly desires, the concept of liberation is inappropriate because a single, unchanging nature cannot have two states.

**Critique:**

Even in the absence of worldly desires, meaning even if one believes in the unchanging nature of the soul, the concept of liberation is inappropriate. Why is it inappropriate? Because a single, unchanging nature cannot have two states; meaning, the unchanging, uncreated, single, eternal nature, which has a single, uniform nature, cannot have two states, namely, worldly and liberated, because it would contradict its single, unchanging nature. As mentioned earlier, liberation does not occur in the transient, non-eternal aspect of the single nature, and similarly, liberation does not occur in the eternal aspect of the single nature. Because worldly desires exist, according to the view of the eternal nature, they will never cease to exist, meaning worldly desires will always remain, and the soul will never be liberated. Thus, the concept of liberation does not arise in the single, eternal nature because the single, unchanging nature cannot have two states.

According to the view of the single, eternal nature, the unchanging, uncreated, stable, single, unchanging nature is eternal. Meaning, that which is not subject to decay or destruction is unchanging, that which is not created is uncreated, that which is always stable is eternally stable, and that which has a single, unique nature is the single, unchanging nature, which is the definition of eternal existence. This is their definition of the word "eternal."

"Shaktrutananurthic Sa" - according to their belief, the nature of the soul is eternal, always stable, and unchanging. It remains in the same state as it always has been, meaning there is no other change, result, or state transition. Thus, it always remains in the same state, and another state is not possible. It would contradict its single, unchanging nature. Therefore, whatever worldly desires exist will always remain worldly desires. It is impossible for another state of liberation to arise from them. Thus, liberation will never occur in the single, eternal nature, and "liberation" will only be a concept! And the path of yoga for liberation will also be "a mere concept"! Meaning, the path of yoga will not be possible in the single, eternal nature. (See page 80)

Yogadristi Samuchaya _ If there is no such state, then the statement that the worldly being is liberated is meaningless.
It is desirable to accept the nature of the soul as a state of being, according to the principles of Tattvika. || 199 ||
And in the two states, there is no such state; the worldly being and the liberated one, the statement is completely meaningless; therefore, from one nature, the absence of the other, according to justice, the Tattvika belief, that is the desired feeling. 100
Meaning-And in the absence of that state, to say that the worldly being and the liberated one is meaningless. Therefore, according to justice, accept the nature of this soul as a state of being.
Discussion and as mentioned above, in the absence of that state, the worldly being and the liberated one, this will only be a meaningless word, because there is no meaning. Therefore, in this way, this soul should be considered as a state of being according to the principles of justice-Tattvika. This state of being is characterized by the removal of the other from the other, that is, it is characterized by the removal of the other by the other.
It has been proven above that in the single, eternal, non-resultant aspect, there can never be two states of a substance that is stable and of one nature. Thus, in the absence of the state in the non-resultant, the two states of the soul, the worldly being and the liberated one, will not occur. Therefore, to imagine these two different states, the worldly being with the feelings of the Tiryanchadi, and the liberated one due to the transcendence of the cycle of births, is meaningless-meaningless, it will only be a word, it will only be a statement, it will only be a statement, it will only be a statement, it will only be a statement, it will only be a statement, it

## Muktatattvamimamsa: Tatvik Svabhavopamad - Parinamaantar (657)

The characteristic of Tatvik Paam is that it undergoes a change of state. From a state of feeling, it changes to a state of Svabhavopamad, from a result, it changes to a Parinamaantar. This is what Svabhavopamad is. The result is that the Samsari Bhaav becomes Svabhavopamad and undergoes Parinamaantar, Bhavaantar. Only then does the Mukta Bhaav decrease, not otherwise. Because if Svabhavopamad does not occur - if one nature does not displace another nature and take its place, and the Samsari Bhaav remains as it is, without Bhavaantar-Parinamaantar, then how can Mukta Bhaav occur? Therefore, according to this logic, this Atma, with its Svabhavopamad-Parinama Bhaav, is considered Tatvik - Paramarthik. Because only in this Paami Atma, with the harmony of the different states, is Yaga-Maag possible. (See. Hyo. Tanet p. 81.)

## Clearances

Dikṣādyātmabhūtam tatmukhyamasyanivarttate | Pradhānādinate haṁ tu tadabhāvann tannatiḥ || 200 ||

Dikṣā, Mala, etc. are inherent in the Atma, therefore, this Atma is the primary one. It is Dikṣā, etc. that are eliminated. Dikṣā, etc. are the causes of the results of Pradhānādi, and in their absence, the Muktātma does not have those results of Pradhānādi.

## Explanation:

Dikṣā, Avidyā, Mala, Bhavadhikār, etc. are inherent in the Atma, they are naturally existing things. Therefore, this Dikṣā, etc. is the primary, unrefined Atma that is eliminated. What is it like? It is the cause of the results of Pradhānādi. And in the absence of Dikṣā, etc., the Muktātma does not have those results of Pradhānādi. It is like this:

Dikṣā means the desire to see, the desire to see the creation of the world. Avidyā means ignorance of one's own true nature. Mala means the internal impurities of Rāga-Dveṣa-Mādi, Bhavamala. Bhavadhikār means the right to Samsara, the dominance of Samsara Bhaav, the power of Samsara Bhaav. This Dikṣā, etc.

## Interpretation:

Dikṣā, Avidyā, Mala, Bhavadhikār, etc., are inherent in the Atma, they are naturally existing things. Therefore, this Atma is the primary, unrefined one that is eliminated. What is it like? It is the cause of the results of Pradhānādi. And in the absence of Dikṣā, etc., the Muktātma does not have those results of Pradhānādi.

Gadarisamuccaya
It is the essence of the soul, the inherent nature of the soul, it is realistic, not imaginary. Thus, being connected with the soul, this initiation, etc. is the main, it is not scattered. This initiation, etc. is the liberation of the soul, it is the purpose of the merit of the main, etc., and when this initiation, etc. is withdrawn, the liberated soul does not have the maturity of the main, etc.
Without attaining the state of non-duality, the being who desires the creation of this world is bound. To attain such a state, that being must have affection for the cause of that creation, and abandon the egoistic delusion of the father. It is appropriate to abandon the desire for the enjoyment of that creation in all ways. And for that to happen, there is no medicine like the refuge of the perfect man. This determination, seeing the miserable beings burning with the three fires, without knowing, brings supreme compassion. Oh Lord! You grant grace, give him devotion in your path, this feeling comes out.”
- Shrimad Rajchandraji. In the above, the nature of the soul is established as being essential, and therefore it undergoes changes in state and feeling. How does this change in state and feeling occur? It is explained here. How does the worldly state and the liberated state - these two states result from initiation, etc.? It is explained here, showing the main, etc. Initiation, etc., which is the inherent nature of the soul, as long as it is not withdrawn, it becomes the cause of the maturity of the inert nature - the main, etc. And when this initiation, etc. is withdrawn, the liberated soul does not have the maturity of nature - the main, etc. The meaning is that as long as there is the feeling of initiation, etc., there is the result of nature, and as long as there is that, there is the world. And when there is an absence of the feeling of initiation, etc., there is an absence of the result of nature, there is an absence of the world, and there is the attainment of the liberated state. Thus, the withdrawal of initiation, etc. is the result of the soul, and the non-result of the soul, all this becomes meaningless and futile.
* “The faith of the name-giver is also |
The garment of the soul, the faith increases the love.” - Shri Samadhishatak, Initiation, etc. is the cause of the result of the village, etc. - Shri Bindu, page 489.

**Translation:**

**Liberation Inquiry: From Initiation to Nature's Transformation > Samsara, In Its Absence, Liberation**

(659) Initiation, etc... »
The result of nature is samsara. The absence of initiation, etc. - the absence of the result of nature > the absence of samsara (liberation)

**Verse 201:**

"Otherwise, this would be eternal, and this is called 'bhaava'. If bhaava is eternal, how is liberation possible?"

**Meaning:**

If the transformation of the primordial principles (praadhanaadi) is eternal, and this transformation is called 'bhaava', and if bhaava is eternal, how can liberation be possible?

**Commentary:**

If we do not accept that the transformation of the primordial principles is caused by initiation, etc., then this transformation would be eternal. This transformation is called 'bhaava' and is known as 'samsara' because it involves the existence of the primordial principles, their nature, and their attributes like mahat. Since the transformation of the primordial principles is eternal, bhaava would also be eternal, and liberation would be impossible.

In the previous verse, it was stated that the transformation of the primordial principles is caused by initiation, devotional feelings, etc., and that in their absence, this transformation does not occur. However, if we do not accept this, then the transformation of the primordial principles would be eternal. This is because anything that has a cause is contingent, meaning it may or may not occur. But anything that is without a cause is either always present or always absent. This is a rule. Therefore, if initiation, etc., are not the cause, then the transformation of the primordial principles would occur naturally and eternally. It would never stop or cease, and liberation would never be possible.

Therefore, it is appropriate to accept that if we do not accept the view that the transformation of the primordial principles is caused by initiation, etc., then this transformation would be eternal. This transformation is called 'bhaava' and is known as 'samsara'. Since this transformation is eternal, it would involve the existence of the primordial principles, their nature, and their attributes like mahat. Therefore, if bhaava is eternal, liberation would be impossible.

## Thagadashtisamuccaya

Because the consequence of Pradhan etc. is what is called Bhav or Samsara. The consequence of Pradhan-Prakruti is that it has the nature of Mahat etc.
From Pradhan, Mahat arises, meaning Buddhi. From Mahat, Ahamkara arises, the consequence of Prakruti. And from Ahamkara, Shodashak Gana arises, meaning the five Buddhi Indriya, five Karmendriya, five Tanmatra and Man, making a total of sixteen.
Thus, according to the consequence of Pradhan-Prakruti, there is a consequence of Bhav-Samsara. So, if the consequence of Pradhan is eternal, then the consequence of Bhav-Samsara will also be eternal. And thus, due to the eternality of Bhav-Samsara, liberation will be impossible. This is illogical. Therefore, the consequence of Pradhan etc. does not occur due to Nishkaran-Ninimit, but it occurs due to the cause of Didaksha-Bhavamal etc. The implication is that Samsara and its cause are eliminated due to Diksha etc. Thus, the principle is established. Diksha etc. - Pradhan etc. consequence - Samsara. Similarly, Pradhan (Prakruti) -> Mahat (Buddhi) -> Ahamkara > Shodashak Gana, (five Buddhi Indriya; five Karmendriya, five Tanmatra, Man.)

**Verse 202**

If there is no state (Avastha) in reality, then how can there be a perception of it? This perception of state is false, so what is the point of it? There is no proof (Man) for this false state.

**Explanation:**

The verse states that if there is no state (Avastha) in reality (Tattvato), then how can there be a perception (Pratyay) of it? This perception of state is false (Brant), so what is the point of it? There is no proof (Man) for this false state.

**Commentary:**

The verse is a critique of the concept of state (Avastha) as a real entity. The author argues that if there is no state in reality, then any perception of it must be false. The author further argues that there is no proof for this false perception.

**Reference:**

The verse is from the **Sri Haribhadrasuri Darshanasamuccaya**, a Jain text that discusses the nature of reality.

**Note:**

The verse uses the term "Avastha" which is a Jain term for a state of being. The verse also uses the term "Tattvato" which means "in reality". The verse also uses the term "Pratyay" which means "perception". The verse also uses the term "Brant" which means "false". The verse also uses the term "Man" which means "proof".

**Translation:**

"If there is no state in reality, then how can there be a perception of it? This perception of state is false, so what is the point of it? There is no proof for this false state."

**Note:**

The translation is based on the understanding of the verse and the commentary. The translation is not a literal translation of the verse.

**Note:**

The verse is a part of a larger discussion about the nature of reality. The verse is not meant to be a standalone statement.

**Note:**

The verse is a part of a Jain text. The verse is not meant to be a statement of universal truth.

**Note:**

The verse is a part of a religious text. The verse is not meant to be a scientific statement.

## Muktatatvamimansa: Bhavanityatva Sathe Mukta Asambhav: Aavantara Siddhi
**Discussion**

If you say that the state of liberation is not from the essence of the state, then how will that state arise as a perception (pratiti) due to the lack of a condition? Therefore, the proponent says, "This may be true, but this state perception is false." What then? The response is that there is no evidence present regarding this false state.

Above, it was proven through pure logic how the two states of the soul, the worldly and the liberated, can arise. And the argument for the eternal state was refuted.

Therefore, the proponent of the eternal state says, "You may have proven those two states and shown the state, but that state is not from the essence." The scholar responds with logical arguments, "Well, if that state is not from the essence, then how will that state arise as a perception (pratiti) due to the lack of a cause? How will this perception of the worldly state and this liberated state arise?"  Therefore, the proponent, cornered, says, "This may be true, but this state perception is false." What then? The response is, "You say that this state perception is false, but what is the evidence for that? There is no evidence here."

**Verse 203**

**Yogijnanam tu manam chet tadavasthantran tu tat; tatah kim bhrantmetatsyadanyatha siddhasadhyata.**

**Meaning:** If you say that yogic knowledge is the evidence, then that yogic knowledge is a change of state. What then? If this yogic knowledge is false, then its non-false nature is the established conclusion, meaning the existence of a difference in states is proven.

**Explanation:**

If you say that yogic knowledge is the evidence here, then that yogic knowledge is a change of state. What then? The proponent says, "This yogic knowledge is false." The response is, "If it is not false, then its non-false nature is the established conclusion, meaning the existence of a difference in states is proven." 

Page #738:
---------------------------
(662)
The collection of perceptions is stable. So what? It is said that this yogic knowledge is false; if not, its non-false nature is true, due to the existence of a difference in states, it becomes provable.
The question was asked above, what is the proof, so the proponent says that yogic knowledge is the proof. The scholar replies that the yogic knowledge that you call proof is itself a transformation of the yogi. So the proponent says - So what? It is a transformation of the yogi, so what has happened? What are you trying to say from above? The scholar replies that this yogic knowledge is either false or non-false. How can you consider it as proof if it is false? And if it is non-false, then it becomes provable. That is, the existence of a difference in states that is non-false has been established, so you have accepted and proved what we wanted to prove! You were trying to escape, but you have fallen into the same trap! So now that you have accepted our opinion, we have nothing to say, because yogic knowledge is itself a transformation of the yogi. It was yogic knowledge before, and then it became, so it is a different state from the previous state. And this is non-false - you say it is proof, so you also accept that this transformation is non-false, proof. Thus, it is proved! Is there too much speculation? - Thus, the argument of the eternal one-sidedness has also been refuted here with proper reasoning.
Therefore, the object is neither only non-existent nor only existent, but is both existent and non-existent, thus the theory of anekanta is established here. The meaning is that the soul is eternal in terms of substance, and impermanent in terms of modification. From the perspective of dravyarthika nay, the soul is eternal, from the perspective of paryayaarthika nay, it is impermanent - it changes with modification. The knowledge of the three states of childhood, youth, and old age occurs to the same person.
The soul is eternal in terms of substance, it changes with modification; the knowledge of the three ages of childhood, youth, and old age occurs to the same person. - Shri Atmasiddhi.
| This is the eternal principle of anekanta!
The nature of the object
The momentarists say that "the object is non-existent in the previous and subsequent moments, and it is existent in the present moment." (1) This statement of theirs is inconsistent with logic, because according to their opinion, the one that is existent in the present moment is the one that is always existent, so it should be a one-sided, impermanent, present-moment existent. Because "the rule is that the side that is always existent is always existent." Thus, according to their belief, the object will be eternally present-moment existent, that is, eternally existent, by default. And that present-moment existence

##  Suttatattvamimamsa: Vastusvabhavasara: Ekanta Anitya Adi Paksha Ayukt (663)

If one does not accept the principle of **Suttatattvamimamsa**, which states that the nature of reality is **Vastusvabhavasara** (the essence of things), then it will be proven that it is always false. Thus, either the object will be proven to be eternally existent in its own form, or it will be proven to be eternally non-existent. Therefore, **Kshanikavada** (the theory of momentariness) cannot stand for even a moment.

(2) Now, if the **Kshanikavadi** argues that "what exists in the previous moment does not exist in the present moment," it is contradictory, like saying "it is otherwise." Because if the object becomes something else, then how can it be "it"? And if it is "it," then how can it become "otherwise" - something else? They argue this way. The same logic applies to their statement: "How can it be 'it' if it does not exist?" And if it does not exist, then how can it be "it"? This leads to a contradiction.

(3) Similarly, there are flaws like the origin of non-existence, etc. Because if one believes in the existence of both existence and non-existence, then non-existence will be produced, i.e., the origin of non-existence will occur. And according to the rule that whatever is produced must also be destroyed, this non-existence will also be destroyed. Therefore, the destroyed object will be reborn in its own form. In other words, the object will be proven to be eternally existent. And if the object is considered eternally perishable, then it will not exist even in the desired moment, i.e., it will be proven to be eternally non-existent.

(4) Now, if you say that it is perishable and has the characteristic of existing in a moment, then even in other moments, it will exist, and this moment-existence will remain. Therefore, what was said will also happen. Because when it exists in a moment, it does not cease to exist, and even after that, it does not cease to exist. In other words, it always exists. Thus, everything that was said about the non-existence of existence, etc., is true. In other words, **Ekanta Anitya Paksha** (the theory of absolute impermanence) - **Kshanikavada** - cannot stand in any way. In other words, the object is not eternally non-existent.

Similarly, **Ekanta Nitya Paksha** (the theory of absolute permanence) cannot stand in any way either. Because (1) the **Nitya Vadi** (the proponent of eternalism) says that what is unchangeable, unproduced, stable, and uniform is true, i.e., the object is eternally uniform. Therefore, the world is real, and its cessation will never occur, i.e., the world will always remain, and the state of liberation will never be produced. Because there is only one nature, and that state always exists. Therefore, to say that there are states of worldly existence and liberation is merely a matter of words. Therefore, it is desirable to consider the transformation from one nature to another as a matter of essence. In other words, only if one nature displaces another and takes its place can the states of worldly existence and liberation occur, otherwise not.

(2) **Diksha** (initiation), **Bhavamala** (the stream of karma), etc., are the essential and primary things of the soul, and they are inherent in the soul. And they are the cause of the transformation of **Diksha** and other primary things. Without them, the transformation of primary things would not occur. In other words, as long as the cause of **Diksha**, etc., remains, the transformation of nature, etc., continues to occur. And when that cause is obtained, the transformation of primary things does not occur. If one does not accept the cause of **Diksha**, etc., then this transformation of primary things, which is without a cause, will always continue to occur. This transformation of primary things...

**Ekanta Nitya Paksha Ayukt** 

Page #740:
---------------------------
(664)
The collection of Gadasti is called the world of existence. And since existence is eternal, how can liberation be possible? Therefore, we must accept causes like initiation. Initiation leads to existence, and its absence leads to liberation. Thus, there are two states. (3) And just as it is said that these states are not due to the principle, how can their perception arise? What is the proof that this perception is peaceful? The proof is yogi-knowledge, which is the transformation of these states. If you call this knowledge illusory, why did you call it proof before? And if you call it non-illusory, you have accepted the side of transformation. In this way, the one eternal side (the object of feeling) does not diminish.

The meaning is that the object is in the form of feeling and non-feeling, that is, it is eternally transformed. If we believe this, then the entire system of existence and liberation will be properly established; because the nature of the object is derived from feeling, etc., yet due to the yoga of its original nature, it becomes feeling and non-feeling as it was. This is non-attachment. And this nature is the object itself, that is, it is its own essence. The state of nature is liberation, it is non-attachment; and the state of change is existence, it is attachment.

We have spoken about the incidental, now we will present the nature, and that nature is the established form, through the explanation of the sick, the liberated, the ignorant, the animal, etc. In it,

"Whether it is the sick, or its absence, or something else, just as it is. The liberated is never born from the sick." (204)

Meaning - The one who is afflicted with disease is afflicted, or the absence of that disease, or something else than that, just as the "liberated from disease" is never born from the sick.

Analysis - The afflicted, that is, the one who is afflicted with disease, or the absence of that disease, or something else than that - the son, etc., none of these three is ever "liberated from disease" due to the sick. This is an example. 1 The one who is afflicted with bile disease, that is, the one who is afflicted with disease, or the absence of that disease, or something else than that, the afflicted, that is, the son, etc., just as the "liberated from disease" is never born from the sick, just as none of these three is "liberated from disease" due to the sick, due to the sick, due to the sick, due to the

##  Sutratattva Mimamsa:  

**The diseased is not free from disease, just as the samsari is not free from samsara (665).**

**A diseased person cannot be called "free from disease" even if he has been cured; because how can one who is diseased be called free from disease? That would be a contradiction in terms. (1)**

**Or, even if the diseased person has a complete absence of the disease, how can he be considered free from disease? Because if the disease itself is not present, how can he be free from it? (2)**

**Or, his son, brother, etc., who are different from the diseased person, cannot be called free from disease. Because how can the diseased person be different and the one who is free from disease be the same?**

**Similarly, how can a passionate person be called free from passion? Or, if there is an absence of passion in the passionate person, how can he be free from passion? Or, how can a different person be free from passion, while the passionate person remains passionate?**

**Therefore, according to the rules of logic, a passionate person, or the absence of passion in a passionate person, or someone other than a passionate person, can never be called "free from passion." Because all three of these cases are directly contradicted, they are against what is seen and desired. Therefore, it follows from this that whoever calls a passionate person free from passion, or whoever calls the absence of passion in a passionate person free from passion, or whoever calls someone else free from passion instead of the passionate person, is clearly deluded, mistaken, and has a distorted mind.**

**卐**

**The Dārśanika commentator says:**

**"The samsari, or the absence of the samsari, or someone other than the samsari, is said to be liberated. Yet, he is not liberated from the main activity, say those who know the liberated." (205)**

**Explanation:**

**The diseased is not free from disease, just as the samsari, or the mere absence of that person, or someone else entirely, is not liberated from the main activity - the ultimate goal - even though he is said to be liberated. This is what those who know the liberated say.**

**Commentary:**

**Samsari - the person, or the absence of that person, or someone else entirely, is said to be liberated. Yet, he is not liberated from the main activity, say those who know the liberated.**

**The three - the person, the absence of the person, and someone else entirely - are not liberated from the main activity because of their attachment to the non-virtuous. This is what those who know the liberated say.**

(666)
The illustrative example given above regarding the collection of obstacles is explained here in detail. Just as a patient, or the absence of the disease in the patient, or someone other than the patient, none of these three can be called free from the disease; similarly, a worldly man, or the mere absence of the worldly man, or someone else entirely separate from him - none of these three can be called free from the main obstacle, from the ultimate truth, because in all these cases, there is an absence of the cause of activity. (1) A worldly man, meaning a soul who is subject to the cycle of birth and death, cannot be called free from the ultimate truth; because if he were truly free from the ultimate truth, why would he be worldly? And if he is worldly, how can he be free from the world? Although, from the perspective of pure conviction, it can be said that "all beings are liberated," this is only a verbal statement and cannot be considered as true liberation from the main obstacle, from the ultimate truth. And whatever is said in this regard is nothing but delusion, falsehood, and mental aberration. The point is that a worldly man cannot be called free from the main obstacle. (2) Or, even where there is only the absence of the worldly man, there is no liberation. Because where there is only the absence of the soul, how can there be liberation? (3) Or, even if someone else entirely separate from the worldly man exists, he cannot be liberated; because just as it is impossible for a patient to become healthy by someone else, similarly, it is impossible for a worldly soul to be liberated from the worldly disease by someone else.

Thus, due to the absence of the cause of activity, the cause of liberation, none of these three aspects can be considered free from the main obstacle. In other words, just as a patient cannot be called free from the disease, similarly, a worldly man cannot be called liberated. Just as there is no question of liberation for a patient who has the disease itself, similarly, there is no possibility of liberation for a worldly soul who has the disease itself. Or, just as it is impossible for a patient to become healthy by someone else, similarly, it is impossible for a worldly soul to be liberated from the worldly disease by someone else, because it would be like saying, "Take the red one and fill it with Haridas," which is absurd! This is a definitive, established, theoretical truth, like two plus two equals four, which cannot be changed at any time. This is a clear, true fact that any human being, young or old, can understand. Yet, whoever insists that a patient, or the absence of the disease in the patient, or someone other than the patient, is free from the disease, is clearly delusional, a direct falsehood; similarly, whoever says that a worldly man, or the absence of the worldly man, or someone other than the worldly man, is liberated, is also clearly delusional, a direct falsehood.

From the above, it is established that (1) some philosophers (Samkhya, etc.)

## Liberation and Its Implications: Misconceptions and the Principle of Anekanta

**(667)** It is a misconception to believe that a worldly being (soul) is always liberated. If a worldly being (soul) is truly liberated, why is it bound by the cycle of births and deaths? How can something that is liberated be bound by the world? And if the belief is that it is liberated, then what is the purpose of all the yogic paths that aim to liberate it from the world? Therefore, this belief is erroneous, a misconception. 

**(2)** It is also a misconception to say that the absence of a being (soul) is liberation. This is an extreme and inappropriate view. Because to call something that is absent as "being" is absurd. How can something that does not exist be liberated? 

**(3)** It is also inappropriate to say that liberation is something separate from the being (soul). According to the momentarists, what existed in the previous moment does not exist in the subsequent moment. Therefore, without any connection between the past and the present, the worldly soul is one thing, and the liberated soul is another. This is clearly contradictory.

Thus, according to the doctrine of one-sidedness (ekanta), the nature of things does not manifest, the system of bondage and liberation does not manifest, and the system of worldly and liberated beings does not manifest. Only through the principle of many-sidedness (anekanta) does the nature of things manifest, the complete and unchanging system of bondage and liberation manifests, and the system of worldly and liberated beings manifests in its entirety. 

This is a profound philosophical discussion that requires further exploration. To understand it, one should study the scriptures like the **Vashanasamuccaya**, **Shastravartasamuccaya**, **Dharmasangrahanu**, **Shrimadb Rajchandra**, **Sammatitarka**, and other influential philosophical texts.

The teachings of the Jinas regarding the nature of bondage and liberation are more complete and accurate than the teachings of other philosophies. This complete and accurate teaching is the one that is logically proven. - **Shrimadb Rajchandraji**

So, what is the nature of liberation? He says:

**"Just as a person with a waning illness is considered free from illness in the world, so too is a person free from the disease of the cycle of births and deaths, due to the waning of that disease."** (206)

**Explanation:** Just as a person with a waning illness is considered free from illness in the world, because of the absence of the illness, so too is a person free from the disease of the cycle of births and deaths, because of the waning of that disease. This is not a claim that the illness is completely gone, but rather that it is waning and will eventually disappear.

Just as a person with a weakened disease is considered "disease-free" in a lake, similarly, a Bhavagī is considered "free" from Bhavagana through its decay, as stated in the scriptures.

**Analysis:** The person with a weakened disease, who is considered "disease-free" in the lake, is not established or proven. Similarly, the Bhavagī, due to the decay of Bhavagana, is considered "free" in the scriptures.

Here, the judge, the scholar, has given the final verdict on the entire discussion, which is unanimously agreed upon by all the lakes and all the scriptures. The person who has a weakened disease, due to the decay of Bhavagana, is considered "disease-free" in the lake due to the absence of the disease. This is a simple and established principle, which does not need to be proven. Similarly, the Bhavagī, who is affected by Bhavagana, is considered "disease-free" due to the decay of Bhavagana, as stated in the scriptures. This is an established principle, which does not need to be proven.

Therefore, there is no need for any further evidence to establish this simple and understandable situation, which is unanimously agreed upon by all the lakes and all the scriptures. What more can be said about this?

To understand the nature of the liberated soul, who has attained Nirvana, the example of a disease-free person is presented here in detail. The disease-free person who is in the lake is not a non-existent entity, nor is he free from disease, nor was he previously diseased. In other words, the disease-free person does not experience any lack, just as the liberated soul does not experience any lack. Just as the disease-free person is not free from disease, similarly, the liberated soul is not free from Bhavagana, but is indeed free. Just as the disease-free person was not previously diseased, but was indeed diseased,

## Muktatnavami Maansa: Freed from the Disease of Existence, Essence, Kalash Kavya

Thus, this soul, freed from the disease of existence, was not previously afflicted by the disease of existence, but was afflicted by it, and now it is free from it.

Here, the world itself is the great disease. Birth, death, etc., are its afflictions. It produces a strange kind of affection, and raga, etc., cause intense pain. This disease of existence is the main one, and this disease has been generated in the soul by strange karma (dravya-bhav) that is without beginning. And it is experienced by all beings, from the lowest to the highest, as is evident from experience. Thus, this disease of existence is the main one, so being freed from it is also the main thing, because the faults of birth, death, etc., are light, and their absence is the essence of their nature. It is like this - even though it is an analogy to its nature, it is the essence of the soul's nature, that is, the original nature is the essence, so its absence of faults is the essence. Due to the absence of the essence, its nature was like a broken pot, and it was a fault. When it regained its original nature, it attained the essence. Thus, just as someone who was afflicted with a disease becomes free from the disease, so too, this soul, which was afflicted with the disease of existence, has become free from the disease of existence. Thus, being free is the main thing - truly, the ultimate goal, the ultimate truth, is the essence of nature.

And this essence is the essence of the soul, that is, it is the essence of the essence. That is, the essence of the soul is the essence of its nature, its inherent state, its innate nature, which is the essence of liberation, the essence of being free. And this essence is the essence of the essence, which is limited to the essence of the object, and not otherwise, because excessive extension leads to faults. If we consider that essence to be either completely impermanent or completely permanent, then the essence of liberation is not possible, as has been explained in detail above.

Someone who has a disease is called diseased, or the absence of that diseased person, or someone other than that diseased person, none of these three definitions can be used to describe someone who is free from the disease. Similarly, a worldly person, or the absence of that person, or a soul other than that person, cannot be called free from the main point of view, from the point of view of truth, from the point of view of the ultimate goal. This is what those who know the nature of liberation say. Therefore, the system of liberation is like this - just as someone who has been cured of a disease is called a "disease-free" person, and is considered to be in a state of liberation, so too, those who were truly afflicted by the disease of existence are free from it due to the destruction of the disease of existence, as is stated in the scriptures.

**Gadashti Kalash Kavya**

**Chamar Chhand (Naarachavat)**

The person who is free from the disease is in a state of liberation, the one who is free from birth has attained liberation; there is no absence of that person, nor is there anyone who is not free, nor is there anyone who is not afflicted by the disease, nor is there anyone who is not afflicted by the disease. 157

The disease of the soul, this is the cause of birth, birth and death are just transformations, the pain of attachment, aversion and delusion is immense; the main cause of this is the karma generated from the beginningless time, which binds the soul to the cycle of births, the Siddhas experience this in all beings. 158 This disease is the main cause of bondage, when it is removed, the bondage is removed, the defects of birth etc. are removed, and non-attachment is attained; the defects of the soul, which were present in the previous births, are removed and non-attachment is attained. 159 Even though the nature of the soul is suppressed by the influence of the karmic matter, it is still the nature of the soul, because of the influence of the karmic matter; the nature of the soul is as it is, and thus the non-attachment of the soul, which was present in the previous births, is removed. 160 The nature of the soul is its own nature, know this through the knowledge of the soul, and believe in your own true nature; the limit of the nature of the soul is this nature, otherwise, there is only the influence of the karmic matter. 161 The patient, his lack of health, is not the same as the other, the disease-free person never loses his health due to the influence of the karmic matter; similarly, the soul, which is born with the disease of birth, its lack of health, is not the same as the other, the liberated soul never loses its liberation. 162 The disease of the soul is removed in the person who has attained liberation, just as the disease-free person remains in the world; similarly, the soul, which has removed the disease of birth, is liberated from the cycle of births, as stated in the scriptures. 163 The lack of disease does not mean the lack of the soul, the disease-free person is healthy because he is free from disease, the lack of birth does not mean the lack of the soul, the soul is healthy because it is free from the disease of birth. 164 The soul is liberated from the cycle of births by the influence of the nature of the soul, which is free from the influence of the karmic matter; by removing the influence of the karmic matter, the soul attains its true nature, and the seed of birth is burnt by the power of the soul. 165 The soul is liberated from its own nature, which is known, the pure, natural, and inherent nature of the soul is the Siddha, the soul is the Siddha; the Brahman, which is the pure consciousness, is the supreme state of the blessed soul. 166

This is the end of the chapter on the liberation of the soul, from the book "Kiritchandra Sumanonandsudan", written by the great sage Grihadracharya, and explained in detail by Bhagavan Das in his commentary "Sumanonandani Brihattika".

**Conclusion:** The thought of the yogi, the form of the Supreme, is worthy of being contemplated.

**Nature says:** All conclusions are stated here—*From many yoga scriptures, this has been extracted in brief. This yoga, due to the difference in vision, is supreme for the remembrance of the Self.* (207)

**Meaning:** This yoga, due to the difference in vision, has been extracted in brief from many yoga scriptures; and it is supreme for the remembrance of the Self.

**Commentary:** Patanjali and other yoga scriptures have been extracted in brief, like extracting butter from milk. What is the purpose? It is for the remembrance of the Self, which is supreme.

Here, the author of this scripture, the great sage, embodies simplicity and straightforwardness. He honestly acknowledges the source of his work. He says that this scripture has been extracted in brief from many yoga scriptures, like extracting butter from milk. He has extracted the essence of many yoga scriptures, like extracting butter from milk. Just as the churning of the ocean yielded nectar, so too has the churning of the ocean of yoga scriptures yielded this great scripture.

**Interpretation:** *From many yoga scriptures*—from Patanjali and others, *in brief*—in summary, *extracted*—separated from them, like *butter from milk*, by what? By *difference in vision*—by the aforementioned characteristics of vision, *this yoga*—the yoga that is being discussed, *is supreme for the remembrance of the Self*—for the purpose of remembering the Self, *it is the most important*.

This great and wise scholar, the Bhagavan, has planted this **Chaugdashtri Samuchchay** (Fourteen-fold Viewpoint Collection), a supreme nectar of yoga. Just as the gods alone know the effort that went into churning the ocean, so too, only this supreme Acharya knows the effort that went into churning this yoga scripture. And just as only he knows the taste of the nectar obtained through that great and difficult effort, so too, only this supreme yoga teacher, the creator of this immortal work, knows the taste of this nectar obtained through that great and difficult effort. This is described in detail in the yoga scriptures. Here, it is stated in a concise summary. It is not an easy task to extract a gem of concise statement from a vast and extensive body of literature. From one perspective, it is easy to expand a concise statement, but it is not easy to condense an extensive one. Because condensing an extensive statement requires great skill, and this Acharya has demonstrated this skill fully, as is evident. Moreover, conciseness is not incomplete or unfinished, but complete in brevity. Just as a portrait of a man can be life-size or as small as a locket, yet even the small locket-sized portrait represents the complete figure of the man, so too, a concise statement of an extensive scripture presents the complete subject matter of the scripture in brevity.

The synonym for conciseness, "**Samas**" (Synthesis), also confirms the same meaning. To synthesize or include a lot of meaning in a few words is **Samas** or conciseness. Just as the sky has the power to encompass and contain infinite objects, so too, **Samas**, in the sense of a concise statement of scripture, has the extraordinary power to encompass and contain infinite meanings. Thus, this scripture, though concise in words, is full of great meaning, and its intention is very profound. And the depth of that intention becomes increasingly apparent as we delve deeper into it. Just as the ocean appears shallow from the surface, but its depth is only revealed when we dive into it, so too, this scripture appears simple on the surface, but its profound intention is only revealed when we delve deeper into it. This scripture possesses this extraordinary power of encompassing and synthesizing; because a simple statement, when touched by the hand of a capable and virtuous person, becomes a powerful and profound statement. A word, when touched by the **Parashmani** (touchstone) of a saintly soul, becomes "**Suvarna**" (golden), filled with infinite meaning. Every "**pad**" (word) of a knower is capable of becoming a supreme "**pad**" (position). That is why, "In every word of a virtuous person, there lies infinite knowledge," - this saying of Shrimad Rajchandraji is truly applicable here.

---------------------------
Conclusion: This scripture, in essence, is like the "Sur" (Sun), a concise summary. (673) Just as a child, when asked "How big is the ocean?", spreads out both hands and says "This big", so too, we can only be amazed by this "ocean-like" scripture and say "It's so big!" We can only do so much, like a child's play. For this "ocean-like" scripture, a profound work of Acharya Chudamani, we can only imitate, with a slight change, the exclamation someone made for Shriman Anandghanji Giraj's work:

"The intention is Shri Haribhadra, extremely profound and generous; the child, spreading out his arms, says the ocean is vast."

"Even a child, spreading out his arms, says the ocean is vast."

"बालोऽपि किं न निजबाहुयुगं वितत्य,
विस्‍तर्ग‍त रथयात वधवुaो . 

Shri Bhaktamar Stotra, or "Sutra", is like a concise statement. It contains a lot of meaning in a few words. This scripture is also like a Sutra. A Sutra, like a thread, can be kept in a pouch, but when unraveled, it can reach from village to village. Similarly, this Sutra-like scripture is concise, but when its essence is unraveled, it can fill volumes of great scriptures. It is full of generous intentions. Just as a thread is wound around a central point (Nucleus), this Sutra-like scripture is also wound around a central point of self-nature. A kite can be flown high with a thread in hand, but if the thread is released, the kite falls immediately. Similarly, this Sutra-like Yoga scripture, with its form as a thread in hand, can be raised high to the highest realms of Yoga Siddhi, but if the thread of form is released, it immediately falls into the abyss of ignorance. Just as various pearls are strung together on a single thread in a pearl necklace, various pearls of wisdom are strung together on a single thread of self-realization in this Yoga scripture. Just as various flowers are woven together with a single thread in a garland, various flowers of wisdom are woven together with a single thread of wisdom in this scripture. Just as a mountain of flowers cannot be worn on the neck, but a garland made of various selected flowers strung together on a single thread can be worn comfortably on the neck, so too, a mountain of scriptures cannot be easily absorbed, but various pearls of wisdom selected and strung together on a single thread of wisdom can be easily absorbed.

(674)
This garland of yoga scriptures, woven together as a collection of yoga insights, can be easily worn around the “neck”. This concise statement makes this yoga scripture comparable to a sutra in many ways.
Furthermore, this concise statement also exemplifies the relationship between the ocean and a drop, and the tree and a seed. Just as the ocean contains a drop and the drop contains the ocean, and the tree contains a seed and the seed contains the tree, the same applies here. It is like this - the composition of the ocean is the same as the composition of a drop. The elements that are present in the ocean are also present in each drop in the same proportion. The elements that are found when analyzing the entire ocean are the same elements found when analyzing a single drop in the same proportion. The entire ocean has a certain taste, and each drop has the same taste. Tasting a single drop is like tasting the entire ocean. That is why it is said that the ocean contains a drop and the drop contains the ocean. Similarly, the composition of the entire yoga scripture, which is like an ocean, is the same as the composition of this concise, rich, drop-like yoga scripture. The spiritual elements that are present in the ocean of discourse are also present in this drop-like yoga scripture in the same proportion. The elements that are found when analyzing the entire ocean of scriptures are the same elements found when analyzing this drop-like yoga scripture in the same proportion. The entire yoga scripture ocean, which is an undivided, non-dual, supreme, nectar-like, ocean of consciousness, has a supreme, nectar-like taste, and this drop-like yoga scripture also has the same taste. Whoever tastes this yoga drop has tasted the entire ocean of scriptures. Thus, the entire “ocean of discourse” has been condensed into this supreme, nectar-like, “drop” of scriptures - it has been condensed, making its taste accessible to all. The wise saying of Shri Rajchandraji is:
“Just as the ocean of discourse is condensed into a drop,
So too is the attainment of the fourteen previous births.” - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
The composition of a tree is the same as the composition of a seed in miniature form. The limbs and branches of the tree, which are manifest, are represented in the seed in an unmanifest form. The tree produces the seed, and the seed produces the tree - this is the eternal cycle. The essence of the entire tree is contained in a single seed.
That is why it is said that the tree contains a seed and the seed contains the tree. Similarly, the entire scripture is like a vast tree, and this concise, essence-filled yoga scripture is like a seed. The composition of the yoga scripture tree is the same as the composition of this concise yoga scripture. The limbs and branches of the yoga scripture tree…

**Conclusion: The Importance of the Author as Illustrated by the Simile of the Seed and the Tree**

(675) Just as the vast expanse of the Yoga Shastra is presented in a condensed form in this seed-like Yoga Shastra (In Concentrated & condensed form), so too, just as this Yoga Shastra-seed is born from the vast Yoga Shastra tree, so too, by contemplating and expanding this Yoga Shastra-seed, the entire Yoga Shastra tree can be born. Thus, the entire essence of the Yoga Shastra tree is contained within this single Yoga Shastra-seed. Such is the amazing power of this seed! All that is needed is a skilled, true seeker, a seeker of truth, a researcher! So be it!

Furthermore, it is easy to give a gross form to the subtle, but it is not easy to give a subtle form to the gross; or it is easy to make a small picture big, but it is not easy to make a big one small, just as it is easy to expand a summary, but it is not easy to summarize an expansion. Therefore, to extract this condensed nectar from the many difficult Yoga Shastra-like summaries, making it accessible to all, is not a small, easy task, but a great, difficult task, a work of great art. And in this creation of such a condensed summary, this Acharya is unparalleled, supremely skilled. His mastery in saying much in few words, his amazing, artistic wonder, is evident in every work of his. To write little and know much - this saying seems to be the essence of his unique style.

"This summary is enriched by the Yoga Shastras of Patanjali and others" - by saying this, the great author has revealed his humility, his lack of ego, his gratitude, his honesty, his steadfastness, his simplicity, his magnanimity, his generosity, his non-attachment, his moderation in writing, and his tolerance towards all philosophies. He has given us a glimpse of his father's supreme generosity, his ethical and spiritual greatness. This discerning reader can understand this for himself. But what is particularly noteworthy is that while others are hesitant or even afraid to mention the names of those from other countries, this supremely generous, magnanimous Acharya has boldly mentioned other philosophical schools with gratitude. And it is no surprise that such a true knower of the right path would do so, because in the right path, there is unity of all philosophies, the right path is agreeable to all philosophies and is the ultimate goal. Although there may be many paths in the world, the path to liberation - the right path - is one, because the pure nature of the self, which is liberation, is the only goal that is to be achieved. Therefore, such a seeker of liberation...

In the path of Yoga, in the path of liberation, where is there room for trivial insistence on differences in opinions and views? Where is there room for the distinction of a father's doctrine or a stranger's doctrine for the aspiring yogi?
There, the truth, the principle that is free from the influence of what is seen and desired, should be accepted with an open heart and an open throat; whatever way the soul attains its true nature, that is the measure there. (See pp. 397-398, and the verses of Atmasiddhi on p. 436)
"आत्मीयः परकीयो वा का सिद्धांत: विपश्चिताम् ।
દરેણાવાયત્તો ચરતુ ચુસ્તબ્ધ પરિબડ્ડઃ ” – Bindu, Play. 24. Therefore, it is extremely wise for this supreme yogacharya, who has no attachment or insistence on opinions and views, to follow this policy; because they are supremely skilled (Expert) in harmonizing all views (Unity), and they have shown extraordinary skill in bringing together and harmonizing the views of other yogas with their own yoga! Which is worthy of the highest gratitude of all views, without insistence on any particular view! So be it!
Thus, just as the brevity of the narrative is a special feature of this book, so is the special subject of this book another special feature. And that subject is the narrative of the path of yoga from the point of view of different perspectives - that is,
This book is divided into sections according to the development of the yogadristi. As explained clearly in each perspective above, this yogadristi narrative is a "spiritual instrument" that indicates the spiritual development of the soul. As this yogadristi unfolds - opens up, the soul ascends to higher and higher levels, and finally, when it is fully unfolded - developed, it attains the state of supreme yogarudha. As the great and powerful Bhavagi Shrimad Rajchandraji has explained - just as the temperature of the body can be measured from a thermometer (Thermometer), a heat-measuring instrument (parashi), so the state of the soul's development can be measured from this "yogadristi" - a spiritual instrument for measuring the state of the soul. Just as there is the method of fourteen gunasthana for understanding the spiritual development of the soul, so there is also this unique method of eight yogadristi.
So, what is the purpose of this yogadristi book being woven together in brief? What is its...

Conclusion: From the perspective of the Jain term "Daṇibheda" (differentiation of the soul), the statement, "For the sake of 'Ātmānusmṛti' (remembrance of the soul)" (677) has been explained. It means "for the sake of 'Ātmānusmṛti', i.e., for the sake of remembering the soul's father, for the sake of remembering the father, by the soul. Just as someone might write a memorandum for the sake of remembering a subject, so too, this Ācārya says that I have briefly compiled this list of yogic principles (Memorandum) for the sake of remembering my father, for the benefit of my own soul. Just as one quickly glances at a brief list and immediately understands what has been done and what remains to be done, so too, one quickly glances at this brief list of yogic principles and immediately understands what spiritual qualities have been attained and what remain to be attained in relation to the father's soul. And just as one then focuses on what remains to be done from the list, so too, here one focuses on the attainable spiritual qualities that remain to be attained, and accordingly, they are achieved through self-effort. Thus, by the soul -

This list is extremely beneficial in this way. Therefore, the intention of this Supreme Soul in telling the Ācārya is this: "I am a soul who is a traveler on the path of liberation, I am a seeker of liberation. I am a seeker who desires to progress on the path of liberation, a seeker who desires to be liberated." And this yogic perspective is a milestone in the spiritual progress of a soul, a measure of the soul's state from which the soul's purpose can be understood. Therefore, it is constantly present in the soul of my father, the great soul, whether or not this yogic perspective is present. This is why I have compiled this yogic text for the sake of "Antarmukha Avalokan" (introspection), for the sake of constant awareness, for the sake of remembrance. This yogic perspective should be constantly before the eyes, so that one can clearly understand how much the yogic perspective of my father's soul has developed, so that the attained state is "secured," strengthened, and protected, and the unattained is "obtained" and brought into being. This is why I have constantly remembered the soul. This is the only purpose of this text. Otherwise, we have no intention of composing this text for the sake of fame, for the sake of worship, for the sake of glory, or for any other benefit related to this world or the next. We have abandoned all those trivial purposes, knowing them to be the poison of "Halahala." Our only purpose is the attainment of the Supreme Nectar-like purpose of self-realization. We have no other purpose, such as fame, etc. "The purpose is one, the soul's, not another." Or, "For the sake of 'Ātmānusmṛti' means for the sake of remembering the soul, this is the compilation of this yogic perspective. This yogic perspective constantly reminds one of the soul, because... 

Page #754:

(678)
The collection of yogadristi, combined with the nature of the self, is called "yoga," and this yogadristi is the study of such yoga, which is born of the nature of the self. Therefore, this yogadristi constantly focuses on the true nature of the self, the perspective of the body is abandoned, and the vision remains constantly on the soul, so that only the goal of the soul, which is the attainment of the self, is achieved. There is no desire for worship, etc., nor is there any internal path to the root of worldly suffering. It is only said that the ultimate goal is to attain the self, and what the seeker attains is the root of the matter." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.
Thus, the purpose of this text is to attain the self in all respects. This yogadristi, which is a distinction of perspectives, is the ultimate, the primary, and the best, because, as discussed above, it is extremely beneficial in the welfare of the soul and in the yoga of the unattainable, and because it constantly keeps the self-nature alive through constant awareness, what other yoga can be superior to this yogadristi?
The second explanation (second explanation) says -
कुलादियोगभेदेन चतुर्धा योगिनो यतः । अतः परोपकारोऽपि लेशतो न विरुध्यते ॥२०८॥ Kulaadi yogabhede, yogi chara prakar
Athi virodh na paamte, kaa'iy par upakaar. 208 Meaning - Because yogis are of four types, due to the distinction of kulaadi, therefore, this text does not contradict any benefit to them.
Discussion
Due to the distinction of kulaadi, yogis are also of four types, generally. Therefore, in comparison to kulaadi, this yogadristi text does not contradict any benefit to them, because they have a bias towards yoga. - Above, "for the sake of self-remembrance" - the main purpose of this yogadristi shastra is to attain the self, which is self-benefit; here, the secondary purpose is to benefit others.
Explanation: - Kuriyojame - due to kulaadi distinction - lineage, kula, cycle of activity, distinction based on the characteristics of the manifested form, vat - four types, yoni no yat - because yogis are generally. What is the result? - Rod - ipopkaar pan - in comparison to kulaadi, raato na viru - it is not contradictory - it does not contradict even a little bit, because they have a bias towards yoga, that is the feeling.

Conclusion: The Sorrowful Ātrī is somewhat Benefited

(679) Just as this text has been beneficial for the sake of self-remembrance – for the sake of remembering the soul of the father, so too, it is possible that this text can be somewhat beneficial for other souls who are similarly inclined. Because their soul-nature is the same, it is possible that they too, through this, will experience self-remembrance – self-awareness. Since the nature of all souls is the same, it is possible that other souls who are similarly inclined, who are fit for the benefit of the same Dharma, will also experience self-awareness through this, if they absorb this influence. Just as a lion cub, who has lived for a long time in a flock of sheep, experiences awareness of its form upon seeing a lion, (see page 113) so too, a soul who has been in contact with – familiar with – the external world for an immeasurable time, may also experience remembrance of its own nature through seeing its own form.

And for absorbing this influence (Reception), some similar qualification is required. Just as a radio receiver must be at a certain specific frequency – wavelength – “G” (Wave-length) in order to absorb the radio broadcast (Radio Broadcasting) waves (Waves), only then can it absorb them, otherwise not; similarly, for absorbing the influence – waves – vibrations (Vibrations) of this G-discourse, the soul must also be at a certain specific, similar frequency – wavelength. Only then can it absorb them, otherwise not. Or, just as a vessel cannot hold more than its capacity, similarly, this spiritual knowledge cannot remain without a suitable vessel. As Shrimad Rajchandraji has said in Moksha Mala, “A thing cannot remain without a vessel, spiritual knowledge remains in a vessel.” This “G” (suitable) being cannot digest this “Jaga” (world) form of great substance. Just as a lioness’s milk is only for a lion cub – “A lioness’s milk is only for a lion cub,” – it will burst in the presence of another; similarly, this “Jaga” form of supreme substance can only be digested by a suitable being, it cannot be digested by others – those who are not suitable, not only that, but it will cause indigestion – dyspepsia – and abdominal pain due to false pride.

And there are four types of such beings, because there are four types of Yoga: G-Yoga, Kula-Yoga, Pravritta-Yoga, and Nishpanna-Yoga. Therefore, there are also four types of beings: Gogi, Kulagi, Pravritta-chogi, and Nishpanna-chogi (whose characteristics will be described later). It is possible that they too, according to their Yoga, will be benefited by this text. And the reason for this benefit is that they have an inner feeling of partiality towards Yoga, they have a natural love – innate love – for the subject of Yoga. 

Page #756:

(680)
Gadastisamurchya
This is because their mental inclination is naturally biased towards yoga, their self-reflection is completely inclined towards yoga. Thus, this Gadasti text, while primarily for self-knowledge, is also secondarily for the benefit of others. In other words, the primary purpose of this text is to benefit both self and others. This is a prime example of how the actions of a great soul, while primarily for self-benefit, also become beneficial for all, for public use. Compare:
" न कवित्वाभिमानेन न कीर्तिप्रसरेच्छया। । कृतिः किन्तु मदीयेयं स्वबोधायैव केवलम् ॥"
–Shri Shubhachandracharya's Shri Jnanarnava. And from this, it is also important to note that true selfless saints who benefit themselves are the ones who are truly capable of benefiting others. Those who achieve self-interest, which is the form of self-interest, are the ones who can achieve the ultimate goal of benefiting others. Because those who do not benefit themselves cannot benefit others; those who do not achieve self-knowledge cannot achieve the benefit of others. Because "If it is in the well, it will come to the air." "If you don't achieve anything for yourself, what will you cook for others?" But those who dare to benefit others without achieving self-interest, who boast about it, lose both and become corrupt. Those who go to teach others without teaching their own soul cannot benefit either their father or others; because without the strength of character, which is the form of self-purification, the intended effect does not occur, the hearts of others are not touched, and it becomes like "water on a stone"! That is why the first and foremost endeavor of the knowers of the right path, the virtuous, the good men, is to teach their own soul, because they feel deeply that: "O soul! You teach me, first you learn, because the country of the wise is the most distant and inaccessible." This profound saying of Shrimad Rajchandraji should be engraved in the hearts of all seekers:
"You teach, first you learn,
The country of the wise is the most distant and inaccessible." – Shrimad Rajchandraji. Thus, the lecture activity of such virtuous, virtuous men, while primarily for self-study, is also like this writing activity, silent. 

Page #757:
---------------------------
**Sunrise Garland:** Self-benefit, like the living, awakened awareness, this is the silent self-study of the 'Sadhu' (holy person).

(681)

It is self-study, it is contemplation; not like the eloquent speakers who spread the knowledge of the Vedas, entertaining the masses; because they know well that where the self-witness is the Dharma (righteousness), what is the use of the masses? Entertainment of the masses is not even a single nut in the value of Dharma.

“Where the self-witness is the Dharma, what is the use of the masses?
Entertainment of the masses is not even a single nut in the value of Dharma.” — Shri Chidanandaji.

Therefore, this self-study, immersed in self-study, from the true soul, yearning for liberation, the true seeker of liberation, the seeker of liberation, the spiritualized, the soul of the future, this self-study of the great sage, even today, touches the hearts of other living, awakened, spiritual seekers, yogis, and bestows upon them immeasurable benefits like the awareness of the living, awakened. This yogic awareness, this yogic teaching of the living, awakened yogi, awakens the yogis, and in the end, reveals the inner, self-awareness, the yogic lamp! And it will continue to illuminate the path for as long as the world exists, such is the supreme divinity in it! So be it!

**In this, here—**

Those who are engaged in the cycle of the universe, they alone are the rightful recipients. Not all yogis are like that, due to their lack of realization, etc. 209

**Explanation:**

Those who are engaged in the cycle of the universe and are not all yogis, because those who are engaged in the cycle of the universe are yogis, they alone are the rightful recipients of this, they have such a lack of realization, etc.

**Commentary:**

In this, those who are engaged in the cycle of the universe and are yogis engaged in the cycle of the universe, they alone are the rightful recipients of this yogic scripture.

**Meaning:** Those who are engaged in the cycle of the universe and are yogis engaged in the cycle of the universe, they alone are the rightful recipients of this yogic scripture, not all yogis, because of their lack of realization, etc.

Conclusion: The Kulgi and the Pravrittachka are not the authorities of this scripture (683). But the reason is different. When the GotrYogi is not the authority here due to the non-attainment of Yoga, then the accomplished Yogi is the authority of Siddhi due to the attainment of Yoga. The purpose of this scripture is for that Siddhi, and the non-authority and that Siddhi have already been achieved by these accomplished-Siddha Yogis. After that, what is the purpose of this for them? What is the purpose of this scripture in the form of words (Theory) for the Siddha Yogi who has shown the Siddhi in practice, who has achieved the Yoga of the essence of nature and manifested the pure soul, who has shown the "Samyasaar" in practice? This scripture in the form of a guide is useful for the traveler on the path of Yoga, but what need does the one who has completed the journey on the path of Yoga have for this scripture in the form of a guide? One needs a support to climb the temple, but just as one doesn't need it after climbing to the top of the temple, one needs this scripture in the form of a support to climb the temple of Yoga, but after climbing to the top of the temple of Yoga, where is the need for it? Just as one needs the support of a stick to climb a mountain, but just as one doesn't need it after climbing to the top of the mountain; similarly, one needs the support of this scripture in the form of a vision to climb the mountain of Yoga, but after crossing all the stages and reaching the peak of the mountain of Yoga, what is the need for it? Because what is there for the one who has climbed to climb? What is there for the one who has attained to attain? What is there for the Siddha to achieve? Therefore, the accomplished-Siddha Yogi is also the authority of this scripture in this expectation.

Thus, the GotrYogi is the authority of this scripture because he is the beginner, and the accomplished Yogi is not the authority because he is the supreme Yogi. Only the middle two types of Yogis - the Kulgi and the Pravrittachka - are the authorities of this scripture. The meaning of Kulgi is - the Pravrittachka who is in the obstructive state due to being far from the stage of Yoga is the beginner here; the accomplished Yogi is not suitable here because he is in the state of Siddhi, which is the culmination of the stage of Yoga; and the Kulgi and the Pravrittachka Yogi who are in the state of the stage of Yoga, which is suitable for them, are suitable here. And that is why -

"Adidhitthi has said in brief, the scripture of Yoga is a guide; the Kulgi and the Pravrittachka, it is for their benefit." - Shri Ch. Da. Sakza. 8-4

He tells their special characteristic -

ये योगिनां कुले जातास्तद्धर्मानुगताश्च ये । कुलयोगिन उच्यन्ते गोत्रवन्तोऽपि नापरे ॥२१०॥ 
Those who are born in the lineage of Yogis, and who follow the Dharma of those Yogis, are called "Kulyogis" - not others, even if they are of the same lineage. 
Commentary: "Those who are born in the lineage of Yogis, and who follow their Dharma, are Kulyogis." 
Those who are born in the lineage of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, are called "Kulyogis." This is evident from both their nature and their actions. It is not just those who are of the same lineage, nor those who are simply born in the same land. 
Those who are born in the lineage of Yogis, and who follow the Dharma of Yogis, are Kulyogis. In other words, those who are Yogis from birth, born Yogis, are Kulyogis. Just as a human being born into the human lineage is a human being from birth, and a lion born into the lion lineage is a lion cub from birth, so too is a Yogi born into the lineage of Yogis a Yogi from birth. 
A Yogi who has completed their cycle of life after practicing austerities in a previous life, and who has been reborn as a "Gabhrashta" (one who has lost their previous knowledge), can become a Kulyogi (Born Yogi). Just as there are humans who are born with a natural talent for poetry, and are therefore born poets, so too are there great souls who are born with a natural yogic power, and are therefore born Yogis. These Yogis naturally awaken to their previous yogic practices, and gain knowledge of the scriptures, such as the Jatismarti. They also quickly and effortlessly continue their previous yogic practices. Just as a traveler on a long journey takes a break at a resting place, and rests, eats, and sleeps, so too do these Yogis, who are born into the lineage of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who are naturally inclined to follow the Dharma of Yogis, and who

**Conclusion:** Kulgi-Aajanyogi, an example, is like a traveler on the path to liberation who, after a period of rest, resumes their journey with renewed vigor. Similarly, a seeker on the path of liberation, after taking a break at a resting place, resumes their journey with renewed enthusiasm. Just as an employee, after completing their work, resumes their unfinished tasks the next day, so too does a yogi, after completing their lifespan, resumes their unfinished spiritual work in the next life. Thus, the journey of a yogi towards liberation is continuous.

Just as a carpenter, after completing their work, resumes their unfinished tasks the next day, so too does a yogi, after completing their lifespan, resumes their unfinished spiritual work in the next life. Thus, the journey of a yogi towards liberation is continuous.

"In the four states of existence, the journey towards liberation is never broken; just as the carpenter's work is never wasted, so too is the happiness of the liberated soul." - Ch. Saza. 2

What others achieve through years of study, Aajanyogis achieve effortlessly, naturally. This is a testament to their extraordinary spiritual power accumulated in past lives. This is evident in the spontaneous enlightenment of the great yogi, Shrimad Rajchandraji, as he himself said:

"From a young age, I was drawn to the knowledge of the truth;
How can I explain this? What effort did I make to attain this knowledge?
It came to me effortlessly, without any fear of rebirth." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

The lives of many great saints who exhibited extraordinary yogic abilities from birth also confirm this. For example, Sant Jnaneshwar, who wrote the extraordinary Jnaneshwari at the young age of twenty, and Vajiswami, who, while playing with dice, remembered his previous life as a muni.  Shri Hemchandracharya, who displayed extraordinary intellectual brilliance at the age of five, and Dharma-Dhurandhar Shri Yashovijayji, Sant Kabirji, Raman Maharshi, and others, all bear witness to this. Even the Tirthankaras themselves were born with the three knowledges of Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi. This is also confirmed by the verse: "A yogi is born into a family of wise men. This is a rare birth in the world." - Gita.

The collection of *gadashti* indicates that one is a *kulgi* from birth. Hundreds of examples of *kulgis* can be given, which are the result of the practice of yoga in previous births. Such *kulyogis* naturally have speed inherent in them. As soon as they wake up from sleep, shaking off laziness, they remember the events of the previous night, and then they quickly and swiftly pass through the stages of *pravrittachakradi* yoga and attain the state of *gadashana* - the state of *siddha*.

The *kulgi* nature, which is described as birth in this *yogikul*, is in relation to spiritual *sanskar*, i.e., it is *sanskar* itself in the form of birth. Just as a man has an external birthplace, similarly, a *gipurusha* has this spiritual birth in a subtle form. In practical terms, just as the external, well-developed body is born, similarly, in terms of ultimate reality, the *yogasanskar* is the birth of the soul, which is endowed with *sanskar*. Just as the gross body of a man is created from the *bijaadhana*, similarly, the subtle *sanskar* body of the soul is created from the *g-bijaadhana*. Just as there are external parents who are the *bijaadhana* of the external body, similarly, there are *yogis* who are the parents in the form of *bijaadhana* of this spiritual subtle body. Just as qualities and characteristics are inherited from parents in the physical body, similarly, *gunasanskar* is inherited from the spiritual *sanskaraswami* *gis* in this subtle body. Just as "like father, like son, and like grandfather, like grandson", similarly, these *gi-balas* are like *gipitas*. But external birth has the purpose of rebirth, while this spiritual *sanskarajanama* has the purpose of non-rebirth. Practical birth has the purpose of death, while this ultimate birth has the purpose of immortality. Or, that external gross body birth is not really birth in terms of ultimate reality, but in terms of feeling, it is the death of the soul, it is the death of feeling; the true ultimate birth of the soul is to be born endowed with *sanskar*. This ultimate, blessed, ultimate *sanskarajanama* has been attained by these *kulyogis*, and from birth, they have attained the religion of *yogis*.

And others who are naturally inclined towards the religion of *yogis* are also *kulgis*. That is, those who follow the religion of *yogis* are also called " *kulgis* ".

What is this " *gi dharma* "? One who has a connection with yoga is a *yogi*, and the connection of the soul with liberation, which is its nature, is called yoga. So, one who has a connection with the soul's nature, i.e., one who has attained the pursuit of the soul's nature, is a *yogi*, and the religion that such a *yogi* has is *gidharma*. What is it? Thus, to pursue the soul's nature, to practice and cultivate the soul's nature, to attain self-realization, is the religion of *yogis*. Moreover, the word " *dharma* " also indicates the same feeling, because the nature of a thing is its *dharma*. 

Page #763:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** What is the spiritual government, the yogi dharma?
(687) "Rahu Rao Gho" meaning the dharma of the self-substance is the self-dharma-substance dharma. To describe the nature of the soul is dharma, to be in its form is dharma, to hold the soul in its form is dharma. This soul's natural form is the same as dharma. So, whoever acts in the nature of the soul, stays in its form, holds the soul in its form, practices the yoga that is the form of the soul's nature, is truly the embodiment of dharma "Gi" and that is also dharma. Thus, yogi dharma is the substance dharma-self dharma that follows the form of the self. To abandon the external transformation and follow the internal transformation is the Gi dharma. The meaning is that whoever has achieved the form that is united with the nature of the soul is "Gi". And the form that is united with the nature of the soul is their true dharma. Whoever is constantly striving to follow this self-nature Gi dharma is the Kulagi. Whoever is devoted to the soul, meaning whoever follows the soul everywhere, whose entire feeling-dharma activity is devoted to the soul, is the Kula yogi. This self-devoted feeling is from the Samkrit guna to the Shaileshi state, so that the Sanvar-Nirjara happens and the causal factor manifests, because here the object of attainment is grasped. (See page 493, 21-522).
"From the Samkrit guna to the Shaileshi, the self-devoted feeling;
Sanvar Nirjara is the causal factor, the object of attainment is grasped." - Shri Devchandraji.
And thus, because of this constant self-devoted feeling, the Samyakdristi yogi purusha, as much as possible, does not oppose the self-substance, does not cause opposition, so he performs all the actions and prohibitions, so that the self-substance is not opposed, he performs all the "dharma" duties, and whatever opposes the self-substance, he does not perform those adharma duties. In short, he "worships the living being, the knowledge-vision-character nature dharma, he avoids the adharma that is the form of attachment-aversion etc.; he embraces the internal transformation and abandons the external transformation. And thus, by performing the actions and prohibitions that do not oppose the self-substance, he "accepts" the self-substance that is accepted by the great ones. (See Kavya page 397) That is why the Kulagi, the seeker of liberation, who follows this Gi dharma-the path of liberation, cuts off the karma-feeling that is the form of ignorance, and constantly strives to embrace the liberation feeling that is the form of his own nature-natural state; he destroys the darkness of ignorance with the light of knowledge, knowing the bondage that is the cause of bondage, he serves the path of liberation that is the form of that cause; he worships the path that leads to the cessation of attachment-aversion and ignorance, which are the main knots of karma; and he follows the method of the path of liberation so that he may attain the "pure soul" that is full of consciousness and devoid of all appearances. (See Atmasiddhi's Gatha page 271, 463)
This is what was said about the Gi dharma-the path of liberation-the eternal substance dharma-the eternal

Where is there any scope for differences of opinion - differences in philosophical views - in the religion of the Self, in the collection of yogic perspectives?
Where is there any difference in caste or attire? Therefore, this pure nature of the Self, the caste and attire, where there is only one goal, that of liberation, in the religion of the Self, there is no Jain, Vaishnav, Brahman, Vedantin, Buddhist, etc., differences in all religions. Sadhu, Shraman, Sanyasi, Jagi, Fakir, etc., external differences in physical forms have no place. What was said above, the emotional form of the religion of the Self - the path to liberation - whoever follows, worships, and meditates on it, attains liberation.
"There is no difference in caste and attire, the path is said to be one;
Whoever follows it attains liberation, there is no difference in it." - Shri Atmasiddhi. Whoever worships this true religion of the Self, is in this religion of the Self. Whoever abandons attachment and choice in any opinion or philosophy, and with devotion follows this eternal religion of the Self, which is the goal of one's own nature, abandoning traditional practices, and continues to practice the self-transformation of yogic religion - all true practitioners, all true followers, all worshippers, all seekers of liberation, all souls, all Jivas, all right-view Sadhus, without any difference in opinion or sect, are the true "followers" of this universal religion of the Self. And by implication - those who are completely averse to this yogic path, who have true inner love, noble attachment, true inner curiosity, and a heartfelt desire to follow it - all these lovers of the right path, all those who follow the path, all those who are curious, are also materially the followers of this yogic religion. Thus, this eternal yogic religion, which is the nature of things, is perfectly suited to be a universal religion; because by nature, all yogic practitioners are of one caste, and they have only one religion, because the religion that achieves the goal of one's nature is suitable for these great yogis. (See Poetry p. 58-59)
"That is the root of the tree of that principle, the religion of the Self;
To achieve the goal of one's nature, that is the religion that is suitable." - Shrimad Rajchandraji. x " लिङ्गं देहाश्रितं दृष्टं देह एवात्मनो भवः । न मुच्यन्ते भवात्तस्मादेते लिङ्गकृताग्रहाः ॥ जातिदेहाश्रिता दृष्टा देह एवात्मनो भवः । न मुच्यन्ते भवात्तस्मादेते जातिकृताग्रहाः ॥"

Conclusion: The Secret of the Word 'Kuli' for True Followers of Jainism

(689) Those who truly follow this most generous and all-encompassing Jainism, regardless of their sect, are all followers of the same Dharma - Sadhamika. The meaning is that whoever truly follows this path of Yoga, whether they are a Jain, a Vaishnavite, a Buddhist, a Brahmin, a Sankhya, or a Vedanti, they are all Sadhamika brothers, Atmabandhus. All those who follow this Jain Dharma with any material or emotional attachment are Kulgi. Here, the material that causes the emotion is the main one, not the material that does not cause the emotion. That is, the material that follows the Jain Dharma as a means of Yoga, which leads to the emergence of emotion, is also Kulgi by implication; and the one that follows with emotion is clearly so. It is only necessary to keep in mind that the material means of Yoga Dharma is good and successful only if it is the cause of emotional means of Yoga Dharma, otherwise it is bad - Mithya. The material should be such that it is the cause of a particular emotion, and it is successful only if it does so, otherwise it is unsuccessful. Those who are interested in knowing more about this should read Shri Haribhadrasuriji's Shri Panchashakashashtra.

"Material Dharma is to suppress the ego, to avoid objects, etc.;
The power of the soul is the nature of good Dharma, the means and the purpose are generous." - Shri Devchandraji. Such great souls are truly Kulgi. Just as a Kulvadhu (daughter of a noble family) behaves in a way that befits her family - she practices Kulina (noble) behavior, just as a Kulputra (son of a noble family) behaves in a way that does not bring shame to his family - he practices Kulina (noble) behavior, so too does a Kulgi behave in a way that befits his father's lineage, and does not bring shame or blemish to his lineage. For example, just as a Kulvadhu follows the family Dharma by not going to other people's homes, staying in her own home, staying within the proper limits of Dharma, and maintaining her chastity, so too does a Kulgi follow the Dharma of his lineage by not going to other people's homes, staying in his own home, staying within the proper limits of Dharma, and maintaining his chastity. Just as a Kulputra avoids all un-Aryan actions such as violence, falsehood, theft, adultery, and taking what is not given, and follows the principles of righteousness and honesty, so too does this Aryan Kulgi avoid violence, which is the destruction of the soul, falsehood, which is the father's word, theft, which is the taking of what is not given, and going to other people's homes, which is adultery.

(690)
He abandons from afar the unrighteous acts such as *gadashti* (sexual misconduct), *vyabhichar* (adultery), and *mamtav* (attachment) leading to the acquisition of another's property, and by severing the *parbhaav-vibhaav* (external influence and its effect), he lifts his ownership from above, establishes himself in his own possessions, and continuously strives to follow the *sanyayniti* (ethics of renunciation) - the true authenticity. Just as a *kulputra* (son of a noble family) enhances the reputation of his ancestors, illuminates his family, and becomes well-established in society, similarly, a *kulgi* (Jain monk) also enhances the reputation of his *bikul* (lineage), illuminates his family, and attains a place in the *yogi* (spiritual) community, becoming well-established in his form, "saving forty-one generations." Therefore, the name "Kulgi" aptly suits him, just like *kulvadhu* (daughter-in-law) and *kulputra* (son of a noble family).

However, those who are born into the lineage of the *Jinadi* (Jain) supreme beings, but do not follow their religion with devotion, or those who follow it only in name, even if their father calls them "Jain" etc., are merely nominal Jains, *gotragi* (belonging to a lineage), but not *kulgi* (true Jain). Similarly, those who are born into the lineage of Buddha, but do not follow his religion with devotion, even if their father calls them "Buddhist," are also merely nominal Buddhists, not *kul-yogi* (true Buddhist). Likewise, it should be understood for others who are called Brahmins, Vaishnavas, etc., but do not possess the characteristics of true Brahmins or Vaishnavas. Those who do not possess the Jain qualities of conquering the enemies like *raag-dvesh* (attachment and aversion), or the wisdom of true *buddhi* (understanding), or the purity of *vaishnava* (devotee of Vishnu), or the true knowledge of *brahma* (ultimate reality) of a Brahmin, even if they are born as Jains, Buddhists, Vaishnavas, Brahmins, or anything else, are not true Jains, Buddhists, Vaishnavas, or Brahmins in their heart and soul. They cannot be called *kulgi* (true Jain) either. The point is that those who do not follow the true path of *yog* (spiritual practice) - the path of *maekshamaag* (non-violence) - are not *kulgi* (true Jain) in any community or any school of thought.

Often, a human soul belongs to some religion or school of thought, and therefore believes that it should act according to that religion or school of thought. But this is not called *mumuksta* (desire for liberation). *Mumuksta* is to strive for liberation alone, free from all kinds of worldly attachments. And intense *mumuksta* is to constantly strive on the path of liberation with unwavering love.
- Shrimad Rajchandra, Patrak 216 (254)
Or it can be called *yog* (spiritual practice) that is merely for physical development, like the exercises practiced by the Vaishnavas. - Shri Narsinh Mehta

Page #767:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** Mere nominal followers, those who are only physically related are not Kulagi.
(691) Those who mock, or under the pretext of Homa-adi process, those who create a sense of speed, or in the name of speed, create many Dhiting, those who mock the great "G" of the great "G" word, or those who pretend to have attained the state of Beti Samadhi and deceive the innocent people, those who eat and drink in the name of Yoga, or those who increase complexity and wear the garb of a Yogi, those who are consumed by the desire for worldly pleasures - all these are not Kulagi. They are the mockers of Yoga, the ones who make the Yogi-kula a laughing stock, and the ones who disgrace the most sacred thing like "G"!
Apart from the Kulagi mentioned above, the others who are Bhumi-bhavya-gotra-yogi are not Kulagi. Bhumi-bhavya means those who are called glorious due to the qualities of the earth. For example, the descendants of the Aryakshetra - this Bharat-bhumi are Bhumi-bhavya. They are Gotra-yogi, but not Kulagi, because mere glory of the earth does not bring about the welfare of any living being. But when a living being attains true glory, when such qualities are manifested, then only welfare happens. The glory of the earth is necessary for the welfare of the soul, it is necessary for the provision of suitable material, but it is only when the material cause is manifested, which is dependent on the cause of opportunity, that it is used, not otherwise. For example, there is complete suitability for attaining Gidharm in this glorious Bharat-bhumi. Because in this divine land, many great souls have taken birth and sanctified this earth. Therefore, it is easy to obtain the means of Gidharm here. But it is only when those means are used to the fullest extent, and the soul's true glory, magnificence, and worthiness are manifested, that it is done. Otherwise, mere Bhumi-bhavya-ta will not yield anything. In this glorious Bharat-bhumi, mere location will not make one a Yogi. Therefore, those who are Bhumi-bhavya-yogi are not called Kulagi. To become Kulagi, one must manifest the qualities that are suitable for Moksha. (See page 316-317) To understand the difference between Gotra-yogi and Kulagi, it is necessary to understand the difference between the words "Gotra" and "Kula". The word "Kula" refers to a close lineage, while "Gotra" refers to a distant lineage. Similarly, Kulagi has a close lineage relationship with Yogi-kula, and Gotra-yogi has a distant relationship. From the above, we can infer that those who are close to Moksha, those who are near, those who are imminent and glorious, are "Kulagi"; and those who are far away from Moksha, those who are distant and glorious, are "Gotra-yogi".
To further clarify this, it is said:

(692)
These are all-merciful, dear to the Guru, Gods and twice-born, compassionate, humble, wise and self-controlled. ||211||
Meaning: And they (the Kulakas) are all-merciful, dear to the Guru, Gods and twice-born, compassionate, humble, wise and self-controlled.
Commentary: "These are dear to the Guru, Gods and twice-born, compassionate and useful." - Saz. 8
And these Kulakas, due to the absence of all kinds of attachments, are all-merciful; due to the influence of Dharma, they are dear to the Guru, Gods and twice-born; due to the absence of Kilesha-paap, they are compassionate by nature; due to their skillful attachment to the sublime, they are humble; due to the breaking of the knots, they are wise; and due to their virtuous nature, they are self-controlled.
These Kula Yogis, who are born in the Kula Yoga and who follow the Gidh Dharma, are all-merciful everywhere. They have no hatred in the world because they are completely free from all kinds of attachments, including Mithya Aagraha, which is the cause of hatred. Hatred is caused by attachment. When someone is attached to a particular belief, they immediately develop hatred towards anything that contradicts that belief. This is because they have a sense of "mine" about their belief. They think, "This is my belief, it is the right one." This sense of ownership leads them to become angry towards those who disagree with them. The person who is attached to their belief thinks, "My belief is true," and the person who is attached to their belief thinks, "My belief is true." Therefore, the person who is attached to their belief is dragged along by their belief and even when they are presented with a different perspective, they cling to their own belief. The person who is attached to their belief is drawn to their belief, and their mind automatically enters into the belief. The monkey of the mind of the person who is attached to their belief pulls the cow of the belief by its tail! And the person who is not attached to their belief...
All-merciful, and they are all-merciful due to the absence of all kinds of attachments. And - Vav-Kriya: - Dear to the Guru, Gods and twice-born - due to the influence of Dharma. And - Vav - Compassionate - by nature, due to the absence of Kilesha-paap. And - Humble - due to their skillful attachment to the sublime. And - Wise - due to the breaking of the knots. And - Self-controlled - due to their virtuous nature. 

Page #769:
---------------------------
## Conclusion: The characteristics of a Kulagi, the absence of attachment everywhere, the absence of attachment to any particular view.

(693) The calf, which is the mind of the Kulagi, follows the cow, which is the strategy, it goes behind it! (See footnote, page 328-329).

Such attachment is only found in an isolationist, because they cling to a particular view, and like a "Vohra's rope," they hold onto it stubbornly! That is, it is from the mind. For example, someone who is attached to a particular practical view, is attached to a particular decisive view. Someone who is attached to a particular knowledge from the soul, is attached to a particular action. Someone who is attached to a particular eternal aspect of isolation, is attached to a particular non-eternal aspect of isolation. Thus, from the mind, the isolationist has attachment to their own views. But from the soul, the non-isolationist has no attachment to anything, because they know the nature of the view well, that every view is good in relation to its father, but is wrong in relation to others. Therefore, it is wrong, it is false, to be attached to any particular view. Knowing this, they never cling to any one view, and accept the appropriate limits of practical and decisive views, and achieve reconciliation. Therefore, when they hear something decisive, they do not abandon their means, but keeping the decision in mind, they use the same means.

"Having heard the decisive word, do not abandon the means;
Keeping the decision in mind, use the means." - Shri Atmasiddhi.

Moreover, in matters of philosophy, they are not attached to any particular view or philosophy; because they are self-realized, they know that those philosophies are true in relation to their own view, and in relation to some other view, they are true. By applying the "self" principle, they reconcile their attachment to philosophies. They know that those philosophies are part of the Jina philosophy, and they are not lacking. Therefore, they are not attached to anything in this regard. (See page 58-59, page 423).

Thus, because of the narrowness of the isolationist's vision, and the vastness of the non-isolationist's vision, from the soul, the Kulagi has a complete absence of attachment to the mind. They are a seeker of truth everywhere, they search for the good everywhere; they do not have the work of the mind, they have the work of the "truth." And thus, they have a complete absence of attachment, so they never develop hatred towards any philosopher. In their mind, they are all fellow spiritual brothers and sisters of the same father. They feel that all souls have the same natural dharma, so because of this equality, all these souls are our spiritual brothers and sisters. With this supreme generous feeling, they have friendship towards all beings.

(694)
There is a collection of yogic vision, there is affection towards them, it treats all beings as its own self. Where can such a person with a friendly attitude everywhere be found?
“Mitti ke samuhu, veram ma = laru”—Shri Jinpravacan
“Satmavat sarvabhutheshu” Shri Bhagavad Gita Sarvatmaman samadasti gho a vachan ne hadey lakhe.”– Shrimad Rajchandraji
2. The love of the Guru-Deva-Dvija is the second virtue of this Kula Yogi. This soul, the seeker of liberation, is very dear to the Guru, Deva and Dvija - he feels very affectionate towards them, and it is the effect of the Dharma he has attained. With a calm and steady mind, if we think, every creature loves the welfare of its father, everyone wants their own good, so whatever is helpful in the cause of that good, is also dear to them. And the Guru-Deva-Dvija become helpful to them in their self-interest, so they become dear to them. For example -
A man suffering from a long illness, lying in the throes of death, if some good doctor cures him, then that life-giving, benevolent doctor becomes very dear to him.
So it is also with this Kula Yogi, in the matter of the supreme benefactor, Shrimad Sadguru Bhagwan! Because - (1) The soul itself, which has been benefiting since time immemorial! The patient was suffering from the great disease of self-delusion, and was lying in the throes of death, “moment by moment, terrifying, primordial, dreadful, fear-filled, death-like”, this Sadguru cured him with the medicine of self-understanding, made him healthy, and planted the seed of enlightenment, the seed of knowledge, and gave him birth. After that, how can this supreme benefactor, Shrimad Bhagwan, not be infinitely dear to this soul, the seeker of liberation?
“Without understanding the form, the suffering experienced is infinite,
I bow to that path, Shri Sadguru Bhagwan” Shri Atmasiddhi. Or (2) If some poor beggar is suffering from great poverty, if someone relieves him of his poverty and makes him rich, then that poverty-removing man becomes very dear to him. After that, - the infinite self-wealth, the fear of one's own form, this soul does not have the awareness of it, so it leaves its father's house and wanders around begging.

**Conclusion:**  "Oh! Oh!  Great Grace to the Sadguru!"  The patient, etc., was a wicked example.  He was clinging to the false and deceitful attachment to the pudgala, and like a thief and a robber, he was filling his sinful belly by stealing from others.  This virtuous Sadguru made him aware of his own true nature, and showed him the way to his own infinite, self-possessed home.  He taught him to stay in his own home, and stopped him from begging for alms in the homes of others.  He stopped him from licking the dirt of the material world, and from stealing from others, and stopped him from filling his sinful belly.  Thus, he made the abundant self-wealth residing in his own home, his devoted servant, and made him full of supreme happiness and wealth.  Why would such a true seeker and yogi not be dearly loved by the infinitely gracious Srimad Sadguru Bhagwan?  Or (3) if someone is lost in a terrible forest, and is wandering around, unable to find food, and someone shows him a simple, straight, and direct path, how much would that person love that guide?  Then, because he was unaware of the direction of the right path in this terrible forest of existence, this being was wandering around in all four directions, suffering from endless wandering.  He who showed him the straight, simple, and innocent path of his own true nature, and who saved him from the endless suffering of wandering in the forest of existence, why would this being, who is grateful for the immeasurable grace of the Srimad Sadguru Dev, not have a stream of love flowing towards him?  Or (4) if someone is drowning in a vast ocean where waves are crashing, and someone saves him, pulls him out, and brings him to the shore, how much would he love that savior?  Then, this being was being tossed around by the waves of birth and death in this terrible ocean of existence, and was swallowing the bitter water of suffering, and the Sadguru Dev, who is like a great savior, saved him from drowning by taking his hand, and brought him to the shore of Shiva-pura.  Why would this grateful being not have an extraordinary love for the Srimad Sadguru, who is the unique benefactor, the ocean of compassion, and the supremely merciful one?
"Oh! Oh! Sri Sadguru, the ocean of compassion, boundless;
Oh! Oh! Great grace that you have bestowed upon this lowly one." - Sri Atmasiddhi
"It seems to me that you have saved Arjin from the ocean of existence;
You have taken him to the shore of Shiva-pura, holding him by the hand." - Sri Yashovijayji.
Or (5) if someone is caught in a fierce fire, and someone saves him with a shower of cool water, how much love would he feel for that savior?  Then, this being was caught in the terrible fire of existence, and the Sri Sadguru saved him by showering him with the cool rain of the nectar of the highest truth.  Why would this seeker not have an extraordinary love for the Sri Sadguru?

##  The Collection of Gadasti
“Oh Lord, the world is a poison, the living beings are tormented by it; Oh Lord, consider them as the treasure of nectar.” – Shri Devchandraji. “The fire of the world’s suffering, the wind that removes the dust of delusion; I bow down to the one who is free from the attachments of Maya.” – Shri Haribhadracharya.

Or (6) If a human being has been poisoned by the bite of a great venomous snake and has fallen unconscious, what kind of Garuda mantra will remove the poison and bring him back to life? How much love will he have for that poison-remover? Then, this living being was poisoned by the poison of Mithyatva (false belief) from the bite of the great venomous snake of Mahamaha. Therefore, this living being forgot his true nature and became unconscious. The great Guru, who is like the supreme mantra, removed the poison of Mithyatva with the help of the mantra of Samyakdarshan (right vision), which illuminates the true nature of the soul, and brought him back to the awareness of his true self. He showered the nectar of Samyaktv (right conduct) and gave him rebirth in the form of liberation. How can the love of this seeker not expand towards the supreme nectar-like Shrimad Sadguru Bhagwan, like a drop of water in oil?

“Oh Lord, Mithyatva is the poison of delusion; Oh Lord, the mantra of liberation is playing in my mind.” – Shri Devchandraji.

Thus, because of the unparalleled favor, the seeker feels immense love towards Shrimad Sadguru Bhagwan. Not only that, but Shrimad Sadguru is such that any true devotee, who is attracted to his supreme qualities, cannot help but feel a natural love for him. Because, when we think about the nature of Shrimad Sadguru, his nature is the same as the nature of the Guru, or “Sadguru” is his nature. In other words, the Guru is his nature in all “Sat” (true) things. Because, the Guru is heavier and more glorious than the entire world. If we put the entire world on one side and the Sadguru on the other, the side of the Sadguru will weigh down. Therefore, Shri Sadguru is the Jagadguru (world teacher). Or, the Sat-Sant (true saint) is his nature. In other words, just as the nature of the soul is, his nature is Sat, true, pure, existing in the present, in the form of ten qualities. It is the nature of the Sant, the nature of the Sadhu. Or, “Sant” means the one who is peaceful, who has given up all his running around for the objects of enjoyment and has found peace in his own nature and attained supreme peace of the soul. He is the peaceful “Sant”.

“Falling, falling at your lotus feet, I ask for the same again and again; You are the form of the Sadguru Sant, make this firm in my mind.” – Shrimad Rajchandraji.

**Conclusion:** The form of the benevolent Guru, the form of God

(697) Such a saintly Guru is self-knowing, impartial, wandering due to the force of past karma, radiating unparalleled speech, and possessing supreme scriptural knowledge. They have the supreme, wondrous state of "Jnani-dasha" where attachment has been destroyed or is tranquil, and the entire world appears like a dream or a mirage. And such a Jnani, even though in a body, appears as if they are not in a body, existing in the supreme, wondrous state of "Dehatit-Videh-dasha" (beyond the body). (See Atmasiddhi Gatha, p. 129, 394). How can a seeker not have unique love for such a supreme treasure of virtues, an ocean of compassion without any impurities, supremely benevolent, supremely merciful, Shrimad Sadgurudev?

"The compassionate, merciful, the support of the devotees, the Lord; Red, O Red!
Serving the Devchandra, the Jina, is the cause of supreme blissful nectar. Red, O Red!" Shri Devchandraji. Just as a seeker has affection for a directly present Guru in a body, they also have the same unique affection for an indirect God who is beyond the body, because that
The form of the inner God becomes the form of the supremely benevolent God for the soul to attain its own nature. The one whose "form" has manifested is God, the one who is "established" in the pure form of the soul is the pure, conscious form of God, the one who has known the soul as the soul and nothing else, that imperishable, infinite form of knowledge is the God, the liberated soul. Because they have shown the path of liberation, they are the law-giver. Because they have shown the path of supreme peace, the path of liberation, the path of Shiva, and have done the "Shankarpana" of the three worlds, they are Shiva-Shankar. Because they are established in their form, yet know the entire universe through knowledge, they are Vishnu. Because they have attained the supreme state of liberation, they are Sugata. And because they have conquered attachment, aversion, etc., and manifested the pure, natural form of the soul, they are the supremely detached, the true Jinadev. (See p. 363-364 and 400-401). Such a pure, natural, innate form of Jinaprabhu is God in practice, and in certainty, that soul is the same God. The worship of Jinadev is, in certainty, the worship of one's own soul, because the state of the Jina and one's own state are one, there is no difference, no difference in form. (See Kavya, p. 112-113).

Without true devotion to this Jinadev, suffering will never cease; therefore, to escape from the fire of suffering in this life, devotion to this supreme Lord is like a supreme nectar
It becomes cool and blissful, like a dense treasure; therefore, how can a seeker not have a supreme love, a unique love, for this supremely benevolent Lord? Moreover, this supreme Lord is in the place of the established form of the soul, which is the goal.

Yoga-drishti-samuccaya | (model) is the ideal form. Just as an artist, sculptor, keeping the pure beautiful ideal in front of his eyes, creates a work of art, so too, this Siddha deva-rupa, keeping the pure ideal constantly in front of his eyes, the sadhaka, the devotee, the seeker, creates the form of the self. (See p. 113) Just as the "Ajkula-gata Kesari" becomes ecstatic at the sight of the lion, so too, this glorious soul, through this devotion to the Lord, takes hold of the power of the self. Thus, being supremely beneficial in the attainment of the form, and being a treasure trove of unparalleled virtues, the seeker has the utmost love for this Parameshti deva, the supreme beloved of the father.
Here, the reason for placing the "Guru" position first is to indicate the supreme influence of the direct Sadguru. Because, in all times, the attainment of the path of liberation is only through the grace of the Srimad Sadguru. Therefore, the "Guru" position is even more beneficial than the indirect Jindeva who lived in the past, because the Guru is direct. Therefore, why is his position placed first? Also, the form of the Jin is not understood without the teachings of the Sri Sadguru, and without understanding it, how can one even understand the benefit of the Jin? In this way, the Srimad Sadguru Bhagavan is also the one who makes one aware of the benefit of the Jin, who is supremely beneficial, therefore, his position is placed first. To show the glory of this direct embodied living form of the Supreme Self, the Sri Sadguru, even in the supremely sacred Sri Navkar Mantra, the "Arihant pada" is found first, and this is also its secret. (See p. 130, Atmasiddhi's Gatha).
Moreover, this Kulagi is also extremely dear to the "Dvija". What is this "Dvija"? It is worth considering in terms of liberation. Dvija is the one who has been born twice, or the one who has been born again, that second birth is the "Dvija", that second birth is the "Dvija", that second birth is the "Dvija", that second birth is

**Conclusion:** "Dwij" (twice-born) and "Paramarth" (ultimate goal), compassion

(69) In this, there is no distinction of caste or attire. Whoever is a worthy person with appropriate qualities, regardless of caste, is eligible to receive this "Sanskar" (spiritual refinement). And such a person who has received this "Sanskar" can be called a "Dwij" or a "Brahman". Because "Tra naanaatiti traaksha: _Brahmane shuddha atmaswaroopa ne jaane te Brahman." Thus, a "Dwij" or a "Brahman" is a person with right faith, knowledge, and spiritual refinement, a "Kulgi" (one who has attained spiritual knowledge), a "Jogi" (a yogi). Such a "Kulgi" with right faith is equal in Dharma (righteousness), therefore, this "Mumukshu" (aspirant) "Kulgi" naturally has love and affection for him. Therefore, he shows various kinds of compassionate affection towards them, helps them in their pursuit of the "Paramarth" path, makes things convenient for them, and does whatever he can with his body, mind, and wealth. In this way, he demonstrates his love and affection.

Thus, this "Mumukshu" "Kulgi" has affection for the "Shreemad Sadguru Bhagwan" (the supreme spiritual teacher) who is the direct benefactor, for the "Paramatma Dev" (the supreme soul) who is the ideal local benefactor, and for the "Samyagdasht" "Dwij" or "Sanskar Swami" (the master of spiritual refinement) who is equal in Dharma.

3. Compassionate - This "Kulgi" is also compassionate. Compassion is a natural quality for him. When he sees someone who is poor, suffering, or in need, he feels compassion and empathy. The pain and suffering that the afflicted person experiences, the same pain and suffering resonates in his soul, his heart melts, and his inner being trembles. Thus, he suffers from the suffering of others. Therefore, he develops a desire to alleviate the suffering of others, which is called "Karuna" (compassion). And he actively strives to remove the suffering of others with all his body, mind, and wealth. Such a supremely compassionate person who is consumed by the suffering of others desires only the happiness of all beings and does only "Sarva Jantu Hitakarani Karuna" (compassion for the welfare of all beings). What is there to be surprised about? Therefore, how can he knowingly inflict pain on other beings, even the smallest? Why would he even harm any living being with his body? And why would he even disturb the spiritual outcome of any living being with his thoughts? (See pages 149, 438, 441) These "Mumukshu" yogis are compassionate, merciful, and full of compassion. The reason for this is the absence of "Filasht Karma" (karmic actions that bind). "Filasht" means difficult, harsh, heavy, and fruit-bearing karmic actions. Therefore, their mental state is free from the harsh and binding results of "Filasht Karma", it is soft and pure like a lotus, moistened with compassion; and their spiritual outcome is extremely soft, melting and dissolving quickly from the heat of the suffering of others.

4. Humility
This Jogi is humble. These Jogi men are humble with humility, they are never arrogant, haughty, or mad. The attainment of Chagidhani is the effect of humility, because without humility, there is no humility, meaning there is no humility of the soul towards the virtues of the soul, knowledge. Humility is the only way to attain self-knowledge (Spiritual education). Therefore, Jogi men are humble by nature, knowing the great effect of humility. Therefore, they maintain appropriate humility towards those who are superior to them in qualities; they perform appropriate services such as rising up and going to meet them, offering seats, worship, respect, and honor. They perform appropriate humility, respect, and reverence towards the Satpurush, the nectar of the Satpurush's words, and the means. And they do not even dream of disrespecting any of them in the slightest. Because they know that disrespect to one Satpurush, one Satvachan, or one Satsadhan is disrespect to all Satpurush, all Satvachan, and all Satsadhan. (See Shloka Footnote p. 423) And worship of one is worship of all, because all Sat is one undivided, inseparable, supreme nectar ocean form. Therefore, worship of one is worship of all, and insult of one is insult of all. Knowing this, these Bhava-Bhiru Jogi men stay away from disrespecting any Sat. And wherever they see qualities superior to their own, the souls of these true quality-loving Mumukhsus become joyful, and they naturally bow down to that quality with humility. They have an excess of "Gunupramaad". (See verse, p. 197-198)
But seeing qualities, they never become envious, or arrogant and haughty. Because they understand well that the reason why my soul, which is devoid of its own awareness, has been wandering for an infinite time, is that I did not serve the true saintly Guru. I did not give up that desire and arrogance. Because of this evil, wicked, great enemy-like arrogance, I have been suffering for so long; if I still hold on to false pride and do not serve the feet of the saintly, I will still have to endure the same worldly suffering. I have never heard of anyone's welfare being achieved through arrogance, but only through service with humility has anyone's welfare been achieved, is being achieved, and will be achieved. Indeed, the scriptures say that even if one has attained perfect knowledge through the teachings of a Sadguru, and the Guru himself is still in a state of delusion (with the veil of knowledge), even then, the Kevali Bhagavan still shows humility to that supremely benevolent Guru. Such are the teachings of humility that Shri Vitragdeva has spoken, the main purpose of which is "Subhag" - auspiciousness. 

Page #777:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** The virtuous, non-deceitful, self-controlled, and wise are understood only by the liberated soul. Therefore, I too, abandoning pride, will follow the path of ultimate humility. Understanding this, the seeker of liberation, the yogi, practices humility as appropriate.

The one who attained omniscience through the teachings of the true Guru, even though the Guru remained hidden, practiced humility towards the Lord. Such a path of humility was described by Shri Vitrag: "The essence of this path is understood by the fortunate." - Shri Atmasiddhi. This humility is the effect of virtuous karma, the fruit of virtuous karma. The karma that leads to further and further virtuous karma is called virtuous karma. Therefore, this humility is attained as the fruit of great virtuous karma, which keeps the chain of virtuous karma going.

5. Non-deceitfulness: The yogi is wise, possessing true knowledge and understanding. This true knowledge arises from the breaking of the knots of ignorance. Therefore, these yogis have right vision and are steadfast in their faith. They have attained true knowledge of the nature of things, and therefore they see the distinction between self and non-self clearly. The knowledge that "I am the self-illuminating soul, distinct from the body and other things," this unshakeable knowledge of the truth is firmly established in their souls. "I am one, pure, full of knowledge and vision, eternally formless, and nothing else, not even an atom, is mine." (See verse page 68). Due to this unshakeable self-awareness, they are never confused, deluded, attached, or entangled in the non-self. Even while dwelling in the midst of it, they remain detached and indifferent, like a lotus in water. The one who tastes the nectar of this right knowledge does not find other tastes appealing; they seem like tasteless, bland, and unappealing.

6. Self-control: The yogi is self-controlled, having conquered the senses. This is achieved through virtuous conduct. The one who truly knows the nature of the self is no longer controlled by the senses, but strives to control the senses. They do not become slaves to the senses, but make the senses their slaves. They do not allow the senses to dominate them, but they dominate the senses. They bind the unruly horses of the senses with the reins of self-control, sit in the chariot of their true nature, and command the charioteer of the mind to drive them forward. They withdraw the five senses from objects, turn them towards their true nature, and employ them in the attainment of self-realization. The insignificant body...

It also extracts the essence of the ultimate goal from the collection of Gadasti, uses it to its advantage, and gets its work done, and like a skilled speaker, it "extracts the essence"! For example, it makes the taste organ successful with the taste of the virtues of a good man, purifies the hearing organ with the listening of good conduct. In this way, by engaging the five senses with external use, it turns them towards internal use, which benefits the soul. "Remain internally focused."
"The one who is pleased with the Lord's face, that is the eye's measure... Jinavar!
The one who names the Jin's feet, that is the head's chief... Jinavar! The one who holds the Ariha's foot, that is the hand's peace... Jinavar! The one who plays in the contemplation of the Jin's virtues, that is the mind's happiness... Shri Trashabhanan." "It is good that I have sung the Lord's virtues, I have taken the fruit of taste, Devchandra says to my mind, all of me is straight like a chariot." Shri Devchandraji.
Thus, here are the six characteristics of this Kulgi - (1) Absence of attachment and aversion everywhere - due to the absence of attachment and aversion. From this, its neutrality and friendliness towards the entire world is indicated. (2) Love for God, Guru, and Twice-born - due to the influence of Dharma. Demonstration - From this, the difference in virtues is shown. (3) Compassion - due to the absence of agreement with the karmas of defilement. From this, his compassion for the suffering is said. (4) Humble austerity - due to the virtue that is connected to virtue. From this, his humility and lack of pride are said. (5) Wisdom - due to the understanding of the knots. From this, his right vision, understanding of truth, right perception, and knowledge are shown. (6) Control of the senses - due to the attitude of conduct. From this, his self-control is shown. From these six characteristics, this aspiring Kulgi is implicitly shown to have right perception, knowledge, and conduct, and the attainment of the complete path to liberation, which is the goal of nature and desire, is shown. These (first) characteristics are so clear, unambiguous, and practical that from them, one can clearly examine who is a Kulgi and what kind of Kulgi they are. These same characteristics are so vast and all-encompassing that they are truly in accordance with the main six philosophies. (See page 558 of the Gita). The one who possesses these characteristics is the true Kulgi, the true Vaishnav, the true Brahmin, the true Buddhist, the true Sankhya, the true Jain, the true Vedantin, the true soul, and the true Siddha Yogi, Shrimad Rajchandraji, who immortalized the true Kulgi in his last work. (See "The one who desires is the Kulgi" page 13). And the one who possesses these characteristics is the one who is entitled to this Yoga Shastra. Thus, the form of the Kulgi has been discussed here in some detail, as much as possible, and it should be contemplated further with one's own mind.

**Conclusion: The Six Characteristics of the Kulagi, the Complete Form of the Pravṛttachakra**

The Pravṛttachakra, first of all, is dependent on the two Yamas; the remaining two are intensely desired, and they are endowed with the qualities of service, etc. (212)

The Artha and the Pravṛttachakra yogi are of two types: those who depend on the two Yamas, and those who are intensely desirous of the remaining two Yamas, and are endowed with the qualities of service, etc.

- Commentary: The eight qualities of service, etc., are complete; the Pravṛttachakra is said to be that; the one who gains the brilliance is the one who desires the two Arthas; the one who gains the initial non-attachment is the one who gains the Pravṛttachakra. - G.D., Sakṣā. 8-5

The Pravṛttachakra is further distinguished as follows: (1) They are dependent on the two Yamas, i.e., they are perfectly dependent on the two Yamas of Icchayam and Pravṛttiyam. And (2) they are intensely desirous of the remaining two Yamas - Sthira-yam and Siddhi-yam. This is due to the virtuous activity. Therefore (3) they are endowed with the eight qualities of service, etc.: service, listening, grasping, holding, knowledge, this, that, and the firm establishment in the truth - they are endowed with these eight qualities.

What is "Pravṛttachakra"? The one whose chakra has become active is the Pravṛttachakra. And here, the G-chakra is presented. That is, the one whose entire yoga-chakra has become active, has started to move, is the Pravṛttachakra. Just as when one part of a wheel is moved by a stick, the entire wheel starts to move on its own (what is "Auto"? matically), similarly, when one part of this G-chakra is touched, moved, the entire G-chakra automatically becomes active, starts to move. This is a very simple but supremely miraculous truth. To move a wheel, one does not have to touch the entire wheel, but by moving one part (handle) with the hand, the entire wheel becomes mobile. Similarly, to move this G-chakra, one does not have to touch the entire chakra, but by moving one of its 

**Vṛtti:** Pravṛvatu punaḥ - The Pravṛttachakra is further distinguished as follows: What is meant is that they are dependent on the two Yamas of Icchayam and Pravṛttiyam. Śeṣārthin - desirous of the remaining, i.e., they are desirous of the two Yamas of Sthira-yam and Siddhi-yam. Atyanta - intensely, due to virtuous activity. Therefore, it is said - Śuśruṣāvigunānvitā - endowed with the qualities of service, etc.; they are endowed with the eight qualities of service, listening, grasping, holding, knowledge, this, that, and the firm establishment in the truth.

The act of turning the hand, which is the form of self-effort, sets the entire cycle in motion. Just as one cycle of a clock starts, all the other cycles closely connected to it also begin to move, and the entire clockwork starts functioning; similarly, when one cycle of the Gachka starts, all the other cycles intimately connected to it automatically start moving, and thus the entire Gachka mechanism starts functioning. And just as the started clockwork moves in a certain direction, so too does this started active cycle mechanism progress towards the attainable state of Siddha. For example:

"When non-violence is touched by the soul, when one acts in non-violence, other virtues like truthfulness, etc., are also touched and activated, because they are the inherent protectors of non-violence. When they are followed, non-violence is also followed, and when they are violated, non-violence is also violated. (1) This is because non-violence means not allowing the self-nature to be harmed or destroyed by passions, hatred, pride, etc. And claiming another's property as one's own is falsehood, which is also a destruction of the self-nature, so a true non-violent person will never lie. Stealing another's property is theft, which is also violence against the self-nature, so a non-violent person will never steal. Engaging in adultery with another's spouse, embracing them, is also a violation of the self-nature, so a non-violent person will never do it. Acquiring another's property is also a form of delusion and attachment, which is a destruction of the self-nature, so a truly non-violent person will not acquire possessions. Thus, whoever is non-violent will certainly follow truthfulness, etc., and whoever follows truthfulness, etc., is truly non-violent. Whoever is non-violent will not indulge in falsehood, etc., and whoever indulges in falsehood, etc., is not non-violent. Thus, there is a mutual inseparable relationship between non-violence, truthfulness, etc., meaning that those who violate truthfulness, etc., are also violating non-violence, so a non-violent person will avoid them. (2) Similarly, whoever embraces the Yoga of "truth" will never say that another's property is theirs, will never call falsehood truth and truth falsehood, but will always call truth truth and falsehood falsehood. Therefore, since committing violence, which is the destruction of the self-nature through passions, etc., is falsehood, a truthful person will never commit it. And whoever commits it is not truthful. They will not commit the act of stealing another's property, because doing so is a violation of truth. They will not engage in adultery with another's spouse, abandoning their own self-nature, because it is equivalent to abandoning the true self. They will not acquire another's property with a sense of self-ownership, because to claim another's property as one's own is a blatant falsehood. The same understanding applies to non-stealing, etc. (See Kavya, pp. 106, 107)" 

Page #781:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** Here, the entire cycle of six karmas, which are the obstacles to liberation, is destroyed by the practice of non-violence and other virtues.

(705) In this way, by practicing with true devotion, even a single virtue, when touched by purity, becomes fully activated, and the entire cycle of karmas automatically starts functioning. This is the great benefit of this active cycle. When this group of virtues touches even a single part of the soul, the entire soul becomes pure! When this group of virtues, like a "magic wand," touches the soul, it brings about a miraculous transformation in the soul! When this offering of yogic devotion is poured out, its magical life-giving effect spreads throughout the soul, from every part to every part!

Thus, the yogic cycle of the yogi who practices this cycle of virtues becomes fully activated. The cycle that previously functioned as an obstacle, without the awareness of the true nature of the soul, and was moving in the opposite direction, "anti-clockwise," and was destructive, now, with the awareness of the true nature of the soul, becomes a facilitator, and the cycle reverses, moving in the opposite direction, "clockwise."

It functions favorably, "clockwise." The six karmic factors, namely, the agent (karta), the action (karma), the instrument (karan), the object (apaadan), the recipient (sampradan), and the location (adhikaran), which previously functioned as obstacles to the soul, now begin to function as facilitators of the soul. Previously, the agent was affected by the external, the action was external, the instrument was used for external purposes, the recipient was external, the object was external, and the location was also external; now, instead, the agent is affected by the self, the action is of the nature of the self, the instrument is used for the purpose of the self, the recipient is of the nature of the self, the object is external, and the location is in the self. Here, the soul itself is the agent, the attainment of the self is the action, the instrument used in the process of attainment is the instrument, the gift of the self's wealth is the recipient, in which the giver, the recipient, and the gift are all one; the discrimination between the self and the non-self is the object, and the basis of all the categories is the location. Thus, it eliminates the obstacles of the karmic factors, which are without beginning, and embraces the virtues that facilitate liberation. Therefore, what previously was done by the external agent, through the external action, with the external instrument, for the external purpose, through the external means, and in the external, is now done by the self, through the self's nature, with the self's nature as the instrument, for the self's nature, through the self, and in the self. In other words, the soul, for the soul, by the soul, for the soul's purpose, through the soul, in the soul, practices. The soul, for the soul, by the soul, for the soul's purpose, through the soul, in the soul, practices. In this way, it practices the virtues of the soul through the six karmic factors that facilitate liberation.

"Mallaanath," meditate on the feet of Jagannath, attain the supreme state of pure primordial consciousness, practice the virtues of the six karmic factors, and only then will you attain the pure form, free from all limitations.

The self-substance is the doer of the collection of actions, its own nature is the cause, the material cause is the result, the applied cause is its efficiency; the self is the giver, its giving is the giving nature, the giver, the receiver, and the given, the three are inseparable. The self-other discrimination is the cause, it is from the non-material cause, the whole cycle is based on the relationship of the place; the obstructive cause is the feeling, it is to be removed from the beginningless, the supportive cause is the dependence, it is to be maintained...that

## Upasahar: Progress towards the Achievable Direction of the Active Cycle

Thus, the seeker, turning away from the direction of the "khaadhak" (worldly desires), starts walking towards the direction of the "shat-kaarak" (six-factor) cycle. Just as a started clock moves in a certain direction, so too does this started, activated "chaag-chakra" (cycle of effort) progress towards the direction of the achievable "siddha" (liberated) state. Moreover, just as a once-started clock gains more and more velocity, so too does this "chaag-chakra", once activated by emotion, progressively gains more and more momentum, reaching higher and higher "chaag-bhoomika" (stages of effort), resulting in progressively higher outcomes and progressively increasing "aatma-pragyaa" (self-awareness).

And due to the swiftness of the purification of these five "yams" (vows) - ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (continence), and aparigraha (non-attachment) - their four "kakshat" (stages) or "bhoomika" (levels) are described: "ichchhaayam" (desire stage), "pravrittiyam" (activity stage), "sthiyam" (stability stage), and "siddhiyam" (achievement stage). These divisions are made according to the progressively increasing degree of purification of ahimsa, etc. There are four "keti" (categories) based on the degree of purification of ahimsa. Just as the body's temperature changes according to the degree of heat, so too does the soul's state of ahimsa, etc., change according to the degree of self-purification. Of these four "keti" of ahimsa, etc., the seeker in the active cycle has already attained the first "keti" - "ichchhaayam" - and is on the verge of attaining the "pravrittiyam" "keti". They are extremely eager to attain the remaining "keti". And for this, their "sat-purushaarth" (righteous effort) is always active, their active cycle is constantly in motion. The reason for this is their "sadupay" (righteous means) activity, their "sat-saadhan" (righteous tools) and "sat-purushaarth" (righteous effort) oriented nature. Therefore, they are intensely active in "sadupay" (righteous means) with undying enthusiasm and full vigor, they have set their minds to it (see page 154).

## Progress towards the Achievable Direction

(707)

And because they are constantly active in "sadupay" (righteous means), they are endowed with the eight "buddhi-gun" (intellectual virtues) - "shushrusha" (eagerness), "shravan" (listening), "manana" (reflection), "nidhidhyasana" (contemplation), "dhyana" (meditation), "samadhi" (absorption), "anubhava" (experience), and "jnana" (knowledge). They are as follows:

(1) **Shushrusha:** Intense desire for "tattva-shravan" (hearing the truth). Just as a young, happy, and beautiful man desires to hear music, so too does this seeker have an even greater desire to hear the eight "tattva-gun" (virtues of truth). This "shushrusha" is the stream of "adhipravah" (inner flow), without it, listening becomes like a "sthala-grupa" (dry land) or like a sleeping king listening to a story.

(2) **Shravan:** Only when there is an intense desire to listen - true "shushrusha" - can there be true "shravan" (listening). This "shravan" is not just the sound hitting the ears, but listening with awareness, with the soul, with the intention of understanding the meaning. Otherwise, it becomes like pouring water from one ear to the other.

is! The story heard and heard, the ears burst, even then Brahma-jnana did not come. '(3) Grahana - After hearing, grahana happens. The one who listened with utmost care and eagerness, his ath grahana happens. (4) Dharana - After grahana, its dharana-avdharana happens. The sanskar of it remains in the mind, remains avidyut. That is dharana. (5) Vijnana - After dharana, special vijnana happens, special khesh happens. Due to the firm sanskar obtained gradually, the khesh becomes firm and the khalata goes away. (6) Iha - After vijnana-khaad, iha-chintan, shanka-samadhan, tark etc. happen. (7) Apoha - After iha, apoha happens. The shanka-sandeh is resolved, the khaadak ansh is resolved and removed. (8) Tattvabhinivesh - After apoha, after all shanka-samadhan is done, after the satark is resolved, tattvanirnay happens, that means, abhinivesh-dridh nishchay-rupa pravesh happens in the tattva, tattva nirधार happens. Such a pravrutti-chakra, which is endowed with these eight gunas, is the yagi purusha. Tatha - 
Aadyavanchakaye. Gaptya tadanyadwayalabhinah.
Easantarino yogaprayogasyet tadvidah. || 213 ||
By the aady avanchak yoga, the other avanchaks are obtained;
Those who are eligible for this yoga-prayoga, the yagi says they are. 113.
Meaning: - By obtaining the first avanchak yag, they are those who have obtained the benefit of the other two avanchaks. They are the ones who are eligible for this yag-prayoga, so the yogavid says.
Vivechan
Tatha, the aady avanchak yoga, which is the hetu-bhoot, by obtaining it, they have obtained the benefit of the other two avanchaks, kriya-avanchak and kula-avanchak. Due to its avadhya-amogh-achuk bhavya, they are of such a form. They are the ones who are eligible for this yag-prayoga, so the yogavid says.
Above, the lakshan of the pravrutti-chakra yagi were told - (1) those who have obtained the benefit of the first yama-dveya, (2) those who have obtained the benefit of the khaki yama. Here, its third lakshan is told: - aady avaachk yag
Vritti - - gavaav dholaacha - - hetu-bhoot, such aady avanchak yoga, by obtaining it, tattva-chaminah - - those who have obtained the benefit of the other two, kriya-avanchak - kula-avanchak, those who have obtained the benefit of it, due to its avashya bhavya, they are of such a form, who? They are - - dhinah - - adhikario, who? Then, yogaprayogaya - - adhikrit, such yogaprayoga - - vritti - - so, tandrah - - those who know it, yogavidah say - - so, the rest is.

Conclusion: The authorities of this great experiment (79) i.e. due to the attainment of the *Chagawanchak*, they have attained the other two *Awanchak* yogas - *Kiya Awanchak* and *Phal Awanchak*, because there is such an unfathomable, infallible, and magnificent brilliance of the *Yogawanchak*, and there is such a type of qualification that the attainment of these other two *Awanchak* is certain. (The form of *Chagawanchak*, *Kiya Awanchak*, and *Phal Awanchak* will be mentioned below. Also see pages 158 to 164). And due to the attainment of this *Pravrittachka* by the *Adya Awanchak*, the remaining two *Kiya-Phal Awanchak* yogas have benefited. Therefore, it is complete with these three *Awanchak* yogas. And thus, those who have benefited from these three *Awanchak*, who have attained *Ichchhayam* and *Pravrittiyam*, and who are determined to engage in the activity of the right path, desiring to attain *Thiyam* and *Siddiyam*, - these *Pravrittachka* are the authorities of this *Yogaprayag*. So say the knowledgeable men, the experts of *Kegan*.

This yoga is truly a great experiment, a great and grand experiment beyond the reach of ordinary people. Because if it succeeds, it will cross the ocean - the welfare of the soul will be achieved, and if it fails, the ship of the *Chaga-Maha-Jiva* will sink! Like the experiment of science, a great thing, if used improperly, leads to acceleration and misfortune, causing great harm. The experiment of science, when conducted by a scientist who knows its method, yields miraculous results; but when conducted by an ignorant person who is unaware of the method, it yields harmful results, and perhaps even the person himself may be blown up! Similarly, this experiment of *Yogavijnan*, when conducted by a knowledgeable yogi who knows the method, yields the most miraculous results; but when conducted by an ignorant person who is unaware of the method, it yields harmful results, and even self-destruction! In the present time, the secret of the powerful atom bomb (Atom-Bomb) has fallen into the hands of ignorant scientists, i.e. scientists who are ignorant of the ultimate truth, and the world has suffered a lot of harm, as is evident. Similarly, if this powerful secret falls into the hands of the wrong people, it is easy to understand how much harm it can cause. Just as the science of materialism, "like showing a monkey a mirror", leads to adverse results and causes great harm to the world, so too, the science of spirituality, when given to an unqualified soul, "like giving a monkey wine", leads to adverse results and causes great harm! One and the same thing can yield poison or nectar depending on its use! Similarly, the right use of *Yogaprayag* yields nectar, and its misuse yields poison! Therefore, this *Yogaprayag*, a grand experiment,

Now, the appropriate authority is needed to test the collection of Gadasti, and that authority is the Kulagi with the great characteristics mentioned here, and the active Cakgis.
Moreover, just as it is not easy to digest glass, and it comes out in reverse without the power to digest, so it is not easy to digest this G-prayagraupa Paro, and if it does not have the strength to digest, it comes out in reverse, in the form of harm! Or, just as it is not easy to digest nutritious yoga-rasayana, and if it is given to an unqualified, weak human being with a weak digestive fire, it becomes heavy for him, and gives a reverse result, to the extent that it even takes his life; but if it is given to an authority with a proper gastric fire, it gives him health and grants him long life; similarly, if this G-rasayana is given to an unqualified being with weak power, it does not digest, and instead, it produces indigestion in the form of false pride, and becomes useless, even causing death in the form of Bhav-pran-haran, Bhav-mrityu; but if it is given to an authority who is a Thegi Purusha, with awakened, powerful energy, it digests properly, and eradicates the disease of birth, giving immortality.
(1) The weapon given to a child who does not even know how to hold a weapon, becomes a killer of himself, and becomes a devourer; but in the hands of a proper weapon expert, a valiant warrior, it becomes a protector. Similarly, this yoga-darshit experiment, if given to an unqualified, inexperienced, ignorant child-being, becomes a devourer of his own misfortune, because it is ill-conceived; and if it comes into the hands of a proper, wise, yoga-authority, it becomes well-conceived, and becomes a protector from the fear of birth. (2) Or, if fire is not held properly, it burns, similarly, if the yoga-agni is not held properly, it burns with the heat of birth-wandering, because it is ill-conceived! (3) Or, a snake, if it is ill-conceived, and held by the tail, kills the holder, similarly, G-prayag, if it is ill-conceived, becomes a cause of death in the form of Bhav-mrityu. As Shriman Haribhadrasuriji said in Shri Yogabindu, if Shramanya-Shramanapan is ill-conceived, it becomes the cause of endless samsara, similarly, if yoga-prayog is ill-conceived, it becomes the cause of endless birth-wandering!
Thus, in all respects, this G-prayog should be placed only in the hands of a proper G-purusha. "Mat ga gha ra nana vyasu dani mih |
Shram garud shvat raaj karo mam |" Yogabindu, 184.

**Conclusion:**  G-Sayan and Duhit Gamga

(711) It is appropriate, and it is worth trying, and it is worth collecting,
Otherwise, there is a complete fear of becoming a great meaningless due to the reverse hope-achievement-miracle-vision etc., and there is every possibility of becoming a Gamga that falls down in the form of yoga corruption. Therefore, here
Such fasters with the above mentioned characteristics are called the authorities of this misuse. Just as a man with royal qualities is fit to sit on the throne, so also a man with yogic qualities is fit to sit on this yogic throne. However, if an unfit-unworthy person dares to climb on it, he will do it - "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread" - he will do the same! Therefore, the above mentioned Kulgi and the active yogis are the authorities here, according to the experienced knowledgeable yogi men. Even in this song, there are junior, middle and superior characters, whose characteristics have been described by the supreme Yogi Shrimad Rajchandraji in his last immortal poem as follows:
"Manda Vishay ne Saralata, Sah Aajna Suvichar Karuna Kamaltadhi Gun, Pratham Bhoomika Dhar. Rokya Shabdadic Vishay, Samyam Sadhan Rag; Jagat Ishta Nahi Atmathi, Madhy Patra Maha Bhag. Nahin Trushna Jiviya Tani, Maran Yog Nahin Kshebh; Mahapatra Te Margna Param Yog Jitabh" - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

The form of Yamadi is explained -
इहाहिंसादयः पञ्च सुप्रसिद्धा यमाः सताम् । अपरिग्रहपर्यन्तास्तथेच्छादिचतुर्विधाः ॥२१४ ॥ Here, in this place, Ahimsa-Ahimsa-adi Dharmas, Panch-Panch-number, Sak Briyad-Suprasiddha, Sarvatantrasadharanapanue, Yama-Yamos, above Icchay, Pravrittiyama, Sthiyame, Siddhi Me, so Satam-Santane Munio, what is the limit? That is, Researchanta - Aparigraha Payat. "Hansaatyantyatradavaparished: ChaT:-" (Patano 2-30) Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Aparigraha are the Yamas - from this statement. Tathaahituturvidha:- Thus, there are four types of Iccha-adi - each one has Icchayam, Pravrittiyama, Sthira Yama and Siddhi Yama. 

Page #788:
---------------------------
(712)
**Yoga-Dristi-Samuchaya Meaning** - Here, the five Yamas, beginning with Ahimsa and ending with Aparigraha, are well-known to the Saints. And each of these Yamas is of four types: Iccha, Pravritti, Sthira, and Siddhi.

**Discussion** - Here, the five Yamas, beginning with Ahimsa and ending with Aparigraha, are well-known to the Saints - the Munis - and are commonly known by all. Because, "Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, and Aparigraha are the Yamas," is the dictum. And each of these five Yamas is of four types: Iccha-Yama, Pravritti-Yama, Sthira-Yama, and Siddhi-Yama.

Just as these five, beginning with Ahimsa, are called Yoga-Sankhya-Adi Yamas, so the Jains call them "Vrat," and the Buddhists call them "Shila." Thus, despite the difference in words, there is no difference in meaning. Therefore, these five well-known Yamas are common to all religions, universally accepted, and well-known to all schools of thought. There is no need for other evidence to prove these well-known Yamas. The nature of these, beginning with Ahimsa, should be understood from the perspective of substance, feeling, and type, and should be understood and practiced accordingly. From the perspective of substance, it means from the external, from the practical, from the physical; and from the perspective of feeling, it means from the internal, from the ultimate, from the equal.

Ahimsa means not harming any living being. "Na Hindya Sarvaali Muutani, Em Vedakruti Che." And "Kamatraavyo Hinsa - Pramattayegthi Prannu Harvu Te Hinsa Che," is the dictum of the Shri Tavaarth Sutra. That is, harming any living being, whether from the perspective of substance, through the senses, or from the perspective of feeling, through the soul, through the mind, speech, and body, with a careless attitude, is called violence; the opposite of this is non-violence. The word "Pramudag" is particularly important here. Violence is only when there is a careless attitude in harming a living being, not otherwise. That is, if a living being is harmed, but there is no careless attitude of the mind, speech, and body, it is not violence. And even if a living being is not harmed, but there is a careless attitude of the mind, speech, and body, it is violence. Thus, if the mind, speech, and body are careful, attentive, and vigilant, and there is a careful effort to protect living beings with a true inner feeling, even if there is physical harm, it is not considered violence. And if the mind, speech, and body are careless, inattentive, and negligent, and there is carelessness in protecting living beings, even if there is no physical harm, it is still considered violence. 

Page #789:
---------------------------
## Conclusion: Non-violence, Truth, etc.

(713) The opposite of violence is non-violence. It means to protect all living beings with utmost care, by keeping the mind, speech, and body free from harm, and by being vigilant and aware. This is non-violence. Thus, non-violence is primarily based on action, but also on intention. (1) When there is no violence in action and no violence in intention, it is the highest form of non-violence. (2) When there is violence in action but no violence in intention, it is a slightly lower form of non-violence. (3) When there is no violence in action but violence in intention, it is not non-violence, but violence itself. (4) When there is violence in action and violence in intention, it is not non-violence, but the worst form of violence. Thus, the foundation of violence and non-violence lies in the impact on the soul. When the soul's inherent knowledge and perception, which are the essence of its being, are harmed by emotions like attachment and aversion, there is violence. When there is no such harm to the soul's knowledge and perception due to the absence of attachment and aversion, there is no violence. This rule applies universally. (See pages 105 to 107)

To speak as things are, to speak the truth, is truth. Or, to speak the truth of things as they are, is truth. To speak truth as truth, and falsehood as falsehood, is truth. And to speak falsehood as truth, and truth as falsehood, is falsehood. Or, to speak without hypocrisy, with sincerity, according to the truth and falsehood in the mind, and according to the actions, to show unity of mind, speech, and body, is truth. Not taking anything belonging to others without their permission is non-stealing. Not stealing the wealth of others, not being a thief, is non-stealing. To practice celibacy with mind, speech, and body is celibacy. To engage in sexual intercourse with a human woman, an animal woman, or a celestial woman, with mind, speech, and body, is non-celibacy. Not accepting any possessions, such as wealth, grain, house, children, etc., is non-possession. Not owning anything belonging to anyone, being completely without possessions, is non-possession. Thus, this is the general form of non-violence, etc., in action.

And in intention, (1) non-violence means not harming the pure nature of the soul. Attachment and aversion, through their destructive power, harm the soul's inherent knowledge and perception, which are the essence of its being. To prevent this harm to the pure nature of the soul, due to the destructive power of attachment and aversion, is non-violence. The essence is that the state of being the pure soul itself is the ultimate, transcendental, and supreme non-violence. And it can be achieved in this way through action, space, time, and intention: (1) To be free from the emotions that hinder the qualities of the soul, etc.

Yoga-Dristi-Samuccaya
When the perfection of qualities results in the perfection of the self, and the self-substance is non-associative with other substances, and the self-substance has no association with the substance of the body, then this is pure non-violence from the perspective of substance. (2) When there is no possibility of influence from the field to all regions, and the awareness of the soul is unbroken with a feeling of being bodiless and pure, then this is pure non-violence from the perspective of the field. (3) Where the origination and destruction of things are subtly perfected, and where the cutting and birth of things are not present, and the nature of things is contained within itself, then this is pure non-violence from the perspective of time. (4) Where infinite qualities and their causes result in their own respective perfections, then this is pure non-violence from the perspective of feeling. Thus, the pure non-violence from the perspectives of substance, field, time, and feeling, is the abode of the supreme non-violent, the supreme compassionate, the supreme merciful, Shri Jinraj, because he is the ship of salvation, the protector of life, both for oneself and others. Thus, non-violence finds its highest ideal in Shri Jin Vitrag, whose beautiful and heart-touching form has been sung by the great soul Devchandraji as follows:

"When qualities result in the perfection of qualities, free from obstructive feelings...O Lord! The substance is non-associative with others, pure non-violent...O Lord! The compassionate Jin. In the field, in all regions, there is no possibility of influence...O Lord! With a feeling of being bodiless and pure, the awareness is unbroken...O Lord! Origination and destruction are subtly perfected...O Lord! Cutting and birth are not present, the nature of things is contained within itself...O Lord! Infinite qualities and their causes result in their own respective perfections...O Lord! Thus, non-violent from the perspective of feeling...O Lord! Thus, non-violent, you are seen as Jinraj...O Lord! The protector of life, both for oneself and others, the ship of salvation...O Lord!" - Shri Devchandraji.

Substance non-violence is also helpful in the practice of feeling non-violence, because substance is the cause of feeling, and substance non-violence is also the natural result of feeling non-violence. Thus, both have a cause-and-effect relationship.

"Through substance, one does not harm the six bodies...O Lord!
This is the practice of feeling compassion...O Lord!
The qualities of the self are unobstructed, the treasury of feeling compassion...O Lord!
Through the qualities of the path of liberation, there is a new propagation of dharma...O Lord!" - Shri Devchandraji. (2) Truth from the perspective of feeling means speaking truthfully from the perspective of ultimate reality, from the perspective of truth. To speak of a thing as it truly is, is truth. To call oneself oneself, and another another; not to call oneself another, 

Page #791:

## Conclusion: भाव अहिंसा, भाव सत्य आदि (715)

**Not calling the non-self as self is truth.** Calling the true as true and the false as false, feeling the truth, etc., and not calling the true as false and the false as true is truth. Except for the pure soul, no other thing is one's own, it is another's, calling that other thing as other, not as self is truth; calling the other thing as self, not as other is falsehood. Thus, calling the non-self as self is falsehood; not calling the non-self as self and calling the self as self, is the ultimate truth. For the ultimate contemplation of this, the appropriate philosophical inquiry has been illuminated by Shrimad Rajchandraji in this way:

"The ultimate truth is that except for the soul, no other object can become the soul. Knowing this with certainty, in practice, while speaking in the context of body, wife, son, friend, wealth, grain, house, etc., one should use the expression that except for the soul, nothing else is mine. While speaking about another soul, even though that soul is not mine due to differences in caste, gender, and such formal distinctions, it is called mine only for the sake of practical conduct; speaking in this way is the ultimate language." etc. (See) - Shrimad Rajchandra, Letter No. 545.

**(3) Not stealing the other's property is non-stealing in the ultimate sense.** Except for the pure soul, nothing else, even an atom, is one's own, it is another's. Taking that other's property is stealing - non-giving. Not doing that is non-stealing. The feeling of taking and giving to others is stealing, not doing that is non-stealing. He who does not commit this feeling-stealing, why would he commit the petty stealing of material objects?

**(4) Wandering - playing in Brahman, i.e., in the pure soul form, is Brahmacharya in feeling.** Wandering - playing in non-Brahman, in the non-self, in the other's property is non-Brahmacharya, or adultery, or sexual union with the other's property, duality. Giving up wandering in the other's property, abandoning adultery, avoiding contact with the other's feeling, playing in the pure non-dual soul is Brahmacharya. Such feeling-Brahmacharya is helpful in achieving material Brahmacharya, and such feeling-Brahmacharya is helpful in strengthening material Brahmacharya. Thus, material and feeling are mutually complementary and supportive feelings.

**(5) Having a feeling of possessiveness towards another thing - other than the soul, fainting, and taking possession of it is possession.** Not having that feeling of possessiveness - possession is non-possession in the ultimate sense. Not considering the other's property as one's own, not considering it as mine, not having the feeling of possessiveness, not taking even an atom of the other's property as one's own is non-possession. He who has this feeling of non-possession, why would he accumulate material possessions? And he who does not take material possessions, which are the extent of fainting, why would his feeling of non-possession not become firm? Thus, both have a cause-and-effect relationship.

(716)
This is a summary of the Yogadristi Samuchaya, in terms of substance and emotion, regarding the five yamas of ahimsa (non-violence) and the rest. Its explanation is wonderful. It is like this: A worldly human being, for the sake of worldly self-interest, commits violence against others, considers them as his own, and then engages in taking and stealing. After stealing, he develops a close connection and association with the stolen object. Due to this close association and familiarity, he develops a sense of attachment, possessiveness, and greed towards it, which makes him become attached to it and bound by it. But a soul seeking liberation, for the sake of its own liberation, does not commit violence against others, does not consider them as his own, and therefore does not engage in taking or stealing. Hence, he does not develop any connection or association with them, and due to the lack of such familiarity, he does not develop any attachment, possessiveness, or greed towards them. Therefore, he does not become attached to them and is not bound by them. Thus, this seeker of liberation, in his state of being, practices ahimsa, which is the essence of his being. And then, he does not allow his state of being to be harmed by falsehood, which is a form of self-deception, or by stealing, which is a form of taking away from others, or by sexual misconduct, which is a form of violation of others, or by possessiveness, which is a form of attachment to others. Thus, the seeker of liberation, for the sake of the highest good, practices the five yamas of ahimsa, satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). The word yama or uparama is also very significant. Because, restraint in one's own being, keeping the soul under control, is yama; and refraining from harming others is uparama. Therefore, that which makes the soul restrained in its own being is yama, and that which makes it refrain from harming others is uparama. The meaning of both words is the same. Each of these five yamas has four types, due to the intensity of purity, which are: ichchayma (desire-based yama), pravrittiyma (action-based yama), sthiriyma (stable yama), and sidiyma (achieved yama). Therefore, there are twenty types of yamas (5 x 4 = 20). For example, ichchahimsa (desire-based non-violence), pravrittihimsa (action-based non-violence), sthirihimsa (stable non-violence), siddhihimsa (achieved non-violence), ichchasatya (desire-based truthfulness), pravrittisatya (action-based truthfulness), sthirisatya (stable truthfulness), siddhisatya (achieved truthfulness), and so on. Now, the nature of each of these types is explained.

Their special characteristics are described:
तद्वत्कथाप्रीतियुता तथाविपरिणामिनी ।
यमेष्विच्छावसेयेह प्रथमो यम एव तु ॥ २१५ ॥ 
kritti-tattvatha kiriyuta- tadvant arthat yamavantni katha pratyeni pritiyukta, taviparinamini- tatha aviparinamini, tadbhavana sthiravathaki, chamey-ukt lakshanavala yamama
cha-i, ava-samajva yogya che, ru-aheen, yamachakrama, ane a prathama tham ga ta-prathama yama j che, anantar-hamunu j kaheva lakshanavali ichchi j ichchayma che, etla mate.

(Translation of the Sanskrit verse):
One who is delighted by the stories of those who have attained the yamas, and whose mind is steady in the thought of the yamas, and who possesses the qualities mentioned above, is considered to have attained the first yama, which is ichchayma (desire-based yama). 

Page #793:
---------------------------
## Conclusion: The nature of *Icchayam* and the practice of non-violence etc. by the *Mumukṣu*

(717) The one who has love for the story of Yamavant and is *aviparinami* (steadfast), the desire in them for *Yama* is to be known as the first *Yama* (i.e., *Icchayam*). 215.

**Meaning:** The desire for *Yama* in one who has love for the story of Yamavant and is *aviparinami* (steadfast), is to be known as the first *Yama* (i.e., *Icchayam*) in this cycle of *Yama*.

**Commentary:** The desire for *Yama* in one who has love for the story of Yamavant and is *aviparinami* (steadfast) due to their unwavering nature, is the first *Yama* in this cycle of *Yama*, meaning it is *Icchayam*.

The desire that arises for *Yama* like non-violence etc. is the first *Icchayam*. Ah! How beautiful, beneficial, and auspicious are these non-violent practices! How wonderful it would be if I could attain these! When will I be fortunate enough to attain these non-violent practices? The true inner desire, longing, taste, and feeling that arises for attaining these non-violent practices is *Icchayam*. It is a great thing to have such a desire from the depths of one's soul. True inner desire is the first and greatest step towards attaining liberation, the first door to entering the righteous path, and the grand entrance to the path of liberation. Without this inner desire, no one can enter this path of yoga, and how can there be any activity etc.? And those who appear to have entered this path through external means - material things - and are hypocrites, they too cannot truly enter this path. They are merely pretending, and their external actions are just a facade. Therefore, true entry into this path cannot happen without *Icchayam*.

Just as there is no sweetness in food without taste and feeling, and it does not go down the throat easily, or it has to be forced down, and it causes nausea and indigestion; similarly, without inner desire, taste, and feeling, there is no true sweetness in the food of the ultimate truth, no emotional sweetness arises, the truth of the food does not go down the throat easily - it does not settle in the heart. Or it has to be forced down the throat - it has to be dragged and pushed into the heart through egotism. It results in distaste and aversion, and that truth does not stay in the stomach - it is vomited out for show, or it causes indigestion and dyspepsia due to false pride. But food taken with taste and feeling is sweet, and it goes down the throat willingly - it does not have to be forced down, it stays in the stomach, and it is enjoyable.

Conclusion: The Love for the Path of Restraint: "Blessed are those great ascetics!"

(719) Such is the nature of non-retrogression. In this world, whoever practices non-violence in thought, word, or deed, speaks truth, acts righteously, observes celibacy, and practices non-possession, upon hearing or reading their story, develops an inner love and affection for them. This is a sign of the desire for liberation. Whether fully or partially, from all or from a particular country, completely or partially, whoever truly practices the restraints of non-violence, etc., or has attained liberation, evokes in the desire-for-liberation a deep sense of admiration and love. For example:

Blessed are these non-violent great ascetics! Who, through their efforts, protect the six categories of beings, consider all beings equal, do not harm even the most subtle of living beings, do not cause even the slightest pain, do not engage in mental violence through attachment, aversion, etc., and are like an ocean of compassion, free from any cause! These ascetic lords, who are constantly in their true nature, do not even touch the slightest trace of external influence! Oh! Their compassion! Oh! Their freedom from attachment! Oh! Their state of being in their true nature! Oh! How amazing is the truthfulness of these saints! Even in their dreams, these men of virtuous conduct do not utter false words! They never call themselves superior to others. In both their actions and their ultimate goal, they speak only truth, truth, and truth. Blessed is their vow of truth! Oh! These supremely honest great souls, who are detached even in their own bodies, do not take even a single grain of what is not given, and do not desire even an atom of external possessions! Oh! Their detachment! How wonderful is the vow of Brahman of these true renunciants and ascetics! They practice a strict vow of celibacy, both in thought and deed! Even in their dreams, even in their play, there is no shadow of sensual desire! They constantly dwell in Brahman, in their pure true nature! Oh! Their great vow of non-possession! Blessed is the ultimate non-possession of these Nirgranthas! They have destroyed all attachments, both material and mental! They do not have even a trace of possessiveness towards even an atom of external things! In this entire world, they have nothing belonging to them except their own soul, they are the ultimate renunciants, free from all possessions! Oh! Their detachment! (See pages 190 and 197-198).

Due to this love and admiration, the seeker spontaneously exclaims: "Namo Ttop Salahool" - salutations to all the ascetics, to all those who are truly virtuous, to all those who are of virtuous conduct! And the one who develops this love and admiration for such a person of restraint, becomes very dear to them, and they naturally develop a fondness, interest, and desire for them. Therefore, they desire: "How wonderful it would be if I could become like these non-violent ones!" "When will I be able to practice these restraints of non-violence?"

Will I be fortunate? When will this opportunity to become a Nigrantha, free from material and mental attachments, come to me? When will we become external and internal Nigranthas? (Shrimad Rajchandraji) “Thoughts of attachment are subdued, the eyes do not look at others;
Consider wealth as equal to stone, and absorb the essence of non-attachment.
Embrace the twelve vows and humility, and consider yourself to be of a sattvic nature;
This is my vow, always auspicious and prosperous, eternally unbroken, remaining throughout the cycle of births.” —Shri Moksha Mala.
Just as a shrewd businessman, hearing of a place with great business opportunities and abundant wealth, is eager to go there and acquire great wealth; similarly, hearing of the benefits of non-violence and other yogic practices, a seeker of liberation is also eager to engage in such yogic practices and acquire great spiritual wealth. This creates interest and desire, and awakens the desire for liberation.
“Your virtues, like knowledge, are infinite and boundless;
Hearing them, your interest transcends all limits…Ajit Jin.” —Shri Devchandraji. And this desire that arises is non-perishable, it never experiences a change or a contrary result; because it is based on a stable state of mind, so this desire never becomes undesirable, love never becomes hatred, and interest never becomes disinterest. The feelings of desire that arise, remain as they are, they never become non-existent due to a change. Such intense and pure desire arises here. The color of this desire and interest has stained the inner being, and it never fades away. Just as the color of a dyed cloth never fades, similarly, this firm color of desire that has stained the soul never fades away. The garment may become thin and tear, but the dye never fades; similarly, the body may become thin and fall away, but this feeling that has stained the awakened soul never fades away; it follows the soul in the next life, like a devoted servant. The mold and the form may disappear, but gold never becomes non-existent; similarly, the form of the body may disappear, but the inner color that has stained the awakened soul, like gold, never fades away. (See, Kavya p. 239) And—
節
सर्वत्र शमसारं तु यमपालनमेव यत् ।
प्रवृत्तिरि विज्ञेया द्वितीयो यम एव तत् ।। २२६ ॥
Vritti: Everywhere, in general, the essence of peace is the observance of Yama.
That which is specific to the cycle of actions is to be known as the practice of Yama. In Yama, the second is the practice of Yama.

Page #797:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** The desire for non-attachment, the characteristic of the vow of activity.
(721) The one who follows it, is a renunciant everywhere;
Activity here is to be known, the second vow is that. 216
**Meaning:** The vow observance which is renunciant everywhere, is to be known as activity here; and that is the second vow.
**Discussion:** The vow observance which is renunciant everywhere, is to be known as activity here, and that vow is the second one, the vow of activity.
The vows of non-violence, etc., which are desired from the heart, considered desirable from the soul, their observance in action is the vow of activity. It is to put non-violence, etc., into action, to bring them into practice, into character, to weave them into daily desires and then into life's dealings, that is the vow of activity. To live a life of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possession, that is the vow of activity. To be diligent in observing non-violence, etc., with the feeling of having done, having caused, having approved, in the activities of mind, speech, and body, and to make the inner desire active, that is the second vow, the vow of activity. Because, when anything is truly desired from the heart, when it is truly loved, then man necessarily strives for the attainment of that desired thing, he makes an effort. Similarly, the one who has developed a true inner desire for the vows of non-violence, etc., then he necessarily strives for the practice of the desired non-violence, etc., he necessarily makes an effort, and in the attainment of that desired thing which has been loved, which has been embraced, no matter how many obstacles come in the way, no matter how many calamities befall him, even then that man does not give up, but on the contrary, with double enthusiasm, he faces those obstacles, overcomes them, and moves forward. Similarly, in the path of attaining non-violence, etc., which are considered supremely desirable from the soul, no matter how many mountains of obstacles come in the way, no matter how many rivers of calamities come in the way, even then the soul-liberated seeker does not give up the pursuit of his desired goal, but on the contrary, with doubled enthusiasm, he overcomes those obstacles, those hindrances, and moves forward, "He perseveres and travels the path." The supremely powerful, knowledgeable man, with his supremely moving, nectar-like words, says:
"No matter what, no matter how much suffering you endure, no matter how much you bear, no matter how many obstacles you endure, no matter how many diseases you endure, no matter how many attachments come your way, no matter how many addictions come your way, even if your life span is only a moment, and a worldly affair, but you must do it, until you are free! There is no escape." - Shrimad Rajchandraji.

Yoga-darshan samurachay “Many mountains stand across your path, O Jagannath! With steadfastness, travel the path, with no one as your companion. Greetings to the Jina, for whom you yearn.” - Shri Anandghanaji. First, someone who is a traveler wishes to go to a certain place, so they begin to walk on their path - they perform the act of travel. And then, while they are on their way, they continue to perform the act of travel until they reach their father’s desired place, overcoming obstacles along the way. In this process, they reach three types of places. They encounter three main types of obstacles in between: Kantak-vin, Javar-vin, and Digmeh-vin. (1) Kantak-vin means that a thorn pricks them, causing a brief moment of pain, but they continue their journey as soon as it is removed. This is the smallest, most insignificant obstacle. (2) The second is Javar-vin, where they develop a fever on the road, forcing them to stop their journey. Once the fever subsides, they continue their journey. This second obstacle is more severe than the first, it is of medium intensity. (3) The third, Digmeh-vin, is the most severe and the most significant type of obstacle. Because of a loss of direction, the traveler forgets their intended destination, they wander off the path, and they continue to face this obstacle until they find their way back to the path and reach their destination. Similarly, even while practicing the path of yoga, which includes ahimsa (non-violence), the seeker, the yogi, encounters these insignificant, medium, and significant types of obstacles. They overcome these obstacles and the seeker continues to move forward. For example, cold, heat, etc., are like Kantak-vin, fever, etc., are like Javar-vin, and wrong belief, which is an internal ailment, is like Digmeh-vin. They protect themselves from violating the principles of ahimsa, etc., and they continue to move forward, overcoming obstacles.
“Without overcoming obstacles, O sage, your journey will not be uninterrupted. How can you reach Shiva-puri through action, if you are unaware? Cold, heat, and external obstacles are like thorns, internal ailments are like fever, wrong belief is like a fever, and its intensity is mild, medium, or severe. The obstacles of food, seat, and victory are overcome by the guru’s grace. Obstacles cannot be overcome without knowledge and practice.” - Prabhu.
Just as a skilled gardener carefully nurtures and protects a delicate plant from its cradle, so too does the seeker, the mumukṣu, carefully nurture and protect the delicate plant of ahimsa, etc., with the help of right conduct, which is like the cradle. 

Page #799:
---------------------------
**Conclusion:** The observance of the three types of vows, non-violence, etc.
(723) One who observes non-violence, etc. Just as a loving mother lovingly nurtures her child, so does a liberated-minded seeker lovingly observe the vows of non-violence, etc. Just as a king who loves his people lovingly protects his kingdom, so does a liberated-minded yogi lovingly protects his kingdom of non-violence, etc. Or if someone has a precious jewel, how carefully does he protect it? He keeps it safe from falling, from being lost, from being stolen, from being damaged by mistake, so he wraps it in silk cloth and puts it in a small box, and keeps it in a cupboard or a safe, and he checks it frequently to make sure it is safe. And thus he constantly protects, hides, preserves, safeguards, and maintains it. Then, how much effort should there be for the protection, constant observance, hiding, preservation, protection, safeguarding, and maintenance of this priceless Chintamani jewel, which is even greater than the great Meru? How much constant awareness should there be? How much undivided effort should there be?
There, "The fifth arrow is difficult, what should we do?" etc., why should one indulge in such petty talk and be complacent? The situation of the world is not yet ripe, when it ripens, then we will talk, so saying, why should one be complacent and take things lightly? (See. p. 153-154)
Everywhere there is peace, and this observance of vows is unique. It is because everywhere there is peace, i.e., peace is the essence, or peace is the essence, or peace is the essence. The essence of this observance of vows is peace, or peace is the essence of this observance of vows, or this observance of vows is the essence of peace. The meaning is that peace arises as the result of the vows, peace is its essential fruit; and vows arise as the result of peace, vows are its essential fruit. Thus, there is a close relationship between vows and peace.
Peace arises everywhere as the essential fruit of the vows, the kingdom of peace spreads everywhere, everywhere, i.e., to the father and the mother, to the material and the emotional, in every way, there is only peace. Because (1) one who serves the essence of peace, which is the vows of non-violence, etc., experiences wonderful inner peace, and also brings peace to others. One who observes non-violence, etc., does not suffer himself, nor does he cause suffering to others. But like cool sandalwood, he soothes the heat everywhere and brings coolness, like the cool moon, he brings joy to all. 

Page #800:

(724)
**The Collection of Gadasti (2)** or the fruit of Yama is Upshama, meaning the cessation of all Kshayas, such as anger, etc. The one who observes Yama, such as Ahimsa, etc., experiences the cessation of Kshayas, such as anger, etc., and also brings about the cessation of Kshayas in others. Because Ahimsa, Satya, etc., naturally eliminate the causes of Kshayas, such as anger, etc., and the influence of the character of the non-violent, truthful speaker naturally affects other beings, thus leading to the cessation of Kshayas in oneself and others. (3) Or, the one who serves Yama, such as Ahimsa, etc., attains Samabhava, a state of equanimity and peace. Because the soul that is equanimous considers all beings equal, considering honor and dishonor, praise and blame, etc., as equal, therefore, it does not experience the disharmony of unrest. (4) Or, the one who observes Yama, such as Ahimsa, etc., experiences Shama, meaning peace in one's own form, and becomes absorbed in that form. The natural fruit of the excellent Yama, such as Ahimsa, etc., is to become absorbed in one's own form. Because not allowing the destruction of one's own form and not moving towards external influences is the ultimate essence of Ahimsa, etc. Therefore, through such Ahimsa, etc., the being becomes free from all external influences and enjoys the ultimate peace of the soul, which is the peace of one's own form, meaning it becomes absorbed in its own form. (See page 395 and page 572)
Or, conversely, the observance of Yama is the essence of Shama everywhere. Because (1) when a being attains Shama, meaning the cessation of Kshayas, its evil thoughts of greed, pride, delusion, and attachment are eliminated. The essence of Shama is Yama, meaning that one does not succumb to anger, etc., and does not engage in violence, etc., and naturally leans towards Ahimsa, etc. (2) Or, when a being attains peace, it also brings peace to others, and does not cause suffering to others through violence, etc. (3) Or, when a being attains Shama, meaning equanimity, it considers all beings equal and does not engage in violence, etc., and observes Ahimsa, etc. (4) Or, when a being attains the ultimate peace of the soul, which is the peace of one's own form, and becomes absorbed in its own form, it naturally observes the excellent Yama, such as Ahimsa, etc.
Thus, the observance of Yama is the essence of Shama, and Shama is the essence of the observance of Yama, meaning they are mutually integrated. The seeker who attains Yama, meaning Uparam (restraint), also attains Shama, meaning Upshama (cessation), and the one who attains Shama-Upshama also attains Yama-Uparam. Yama is there, Shama is there, because the one who attains the cessation of Kshayas, etc., experiences Shama due to the objects of sense, etc., and there is necessarily Uparam-restraint from violence, etc., due to Yama. And the one who has Uparam from violence, etc., due to the objects of sense, etc., experiences the cessation of Kshayas, etc., because there is Kshaya from the object of sense, and the object of sense from Kshaya. Therefore, the one who attains restraint also attains peace, and the one who attains peace also attains restraint. "The wise one has 8 restraints, meaning (1) the one who is free from external influences...

##  Upashar:  Chamne Saar Sham, Shamna Saar Cham (725)

**Translation:**

**Upashar:**  The essence of calmness is peace, and the essence of peace is calmness.

**Explanation:**

* **(725)** This is a statement about the interconnectedness of calmness (sham) and peace (viriti). 
* **(2)**  The one who attains peace (viriti) through restraint (uparama) experiences calmness (upashma) in that very form. And the one who experiences calmness (upashma) in that form attains peace (uparama) through restraint (viriti) from external influences.
* **OR** The one who practices restraint (samyama) towards the soul's journey towards liberation experiences calmness (sham) in that form. And the one who experiences calmness (sham) in that form attains restraint (samyama) towards the soul's journey towards liberation.

**Further Explanation:**

This passage explains the process of achieving calmness (upashma) through restraint (viriti). It states that:

* Initially, the soul experiences calmness (upashma) as a result of restraint (viriti). This leads to a state of peace (viriti) where the soul is free from violence and other negative actions.
* This peace (viriti) leads to the experience of inner peace and happiness, which in turn motivates further restraint (viriti).
* This cycle continues, with increasing levels of restraint (viriti) leading to deeper levels of calmness (sham) and happiness.
* Ultimately, complete restraint (viriti) leads to complete calmness (sham) and the soul attains its true nature.

**The Essence of Restraint (Yama):**

The passage emphasizes that calmness (sham) is the essence of restraint (yama). The more calmness (sham) one experiences, the more successful one is in practicing restraint (yama). The attainment of calmness (sham) is the key to the success of restraint (yama).

**The Fruit of Restraint (Yama):**

When the soul experiences the cessation of passions (kashya), equanimity (samabhava), and inner peace (atmashakti), it signifies that the fruit of restraint (yama) has been achieved. Just as every action has a specific result, the result of restraint (yama) is calmness (sham). This calmness (sham) surpasses even the happiness of Indra, the king of the gods, and other worldly pleasures.

**Quote from Uma Swami:**

"There is no happiness for the king of kings, nor for the king of gods. The happiness of the soul is greater than all other happiness." - Shri Prashamati

**Third Yama:**

The passage also mentions the third yama, which is the state of stability achieved through restraint (yama) free from any external influences.

**Conclusion:**

This passage highlights the importance of restraint (yama) in achieving calmness (sham) and ultimately attaining liberation. It emphasizes that calmness (sham) is the essence of restraint (yama) and its ultimate fruit.

Yoga-drushti-samuccaya
Meaning: The observance of Yama, which is free from the anxiety of opposition, is known here as sthaya Yama; and that is the third Yama, sthira Yama.
Commentary:
The observance of Yama, which is free from the anxiety of opposition, such as aticara, etc., and which is characterized by the specific cessation of kshaya, is sthaya in Yama; and that is the third sthira Yama.
Therefore, the observance of ahimsa Yama becomes so strong that there is no need to worry about the possibility of aticara, etc., by mistake. This is called stability. There was also observance of Yama in pravritti Yama, but there was still the possibility of faults such as aticara, deshabhang, aticara, etc.; and here, in sthira Yama, it becomes so free from anxiety, so stable, that there is no possibility of faults such as aticara, etc. In pravritti Yama, there was still the fear of deshabhang, aticara, and vyaghata due to the possibility of the opposite faults of himsa, etc., to ahimsa, etc., but now there is no scope for such fear. There was fear of the obstacle of previous aticara, the obstacle of himsa, etc., and the obstacle of digmeha due to matimeha-mithyatva. But now there is no fear of any such obstacle. There is definite activity in the path of Yama, because the one who walks the path for the first time is ignorant and stumbles and encounters obstacles; therefore, he has to walk with care, worrying about not stumbling and not encountering obstacles, or about removing them; but later, when he becomes familiar with the path and becomes a seasoned traveler, he does not have to fear stumbling or encountering obstacles, so he walks confidently and fearlessly. Similarly, in the path of ahimsa, etc., the one who walks the path for the first time is ignorant and inexperienced, and he stumbles, encounters aticara, etc., and encounters obstacles of himsa, etc., so he has to walk with care, worrying about not stumbling, not encountering obstacles, or about removing them; but later, when he becomes knowledgeable and experienced, he does not fear stumbling or encountering obstacles of himsa, etc., so he walks confidently and fearlessly in the path of ahimsa, etc.
The beginner yogi is 'raw' and still has the possibility of stumbling and aticara, but the mature, experienced yogi is 'ripe' and does not have the possibility of stumbling, even by mistake. (1) A new student makes mistakes when learning a lesson.

##  Supplement: Stable characteristics of the vows, freedom from thoughts of transgression, etc.

(727)

It is true that a mature scholar can effortlessly perform even the most difficult tasks, without the slightest chance of error. Similarly, while those who are new to the practice of non-violence, etc., may fear committing transgressions while performing these primary activities, those who have become adept through steadfast adherence to these principles are free from the fear of such transgressions. (2) For a novice who begins exercising, it is initially difficult to even lift a small weight, and it may slip from their hands. However, for a seasoned athlete with a well-trained body, lifting heavy weights becomes a game, and the weight never slips from their grasp. Similarly, for those who are new to the practice of the vows of non-violence, etc., it may initially seem difficult, and there may be a fear of transgression. But for those who have become strong and well-trained in the practice of the vows, through consistent effort, the observance of these heavy vows becomes a game, and there is no fear of transgression. (3) Even standing on the edge of a sword is initially difficult for a novice, and they may stumble. But with practice, they can not only stand on the edge of the sword, but also dance gracefully upon it without stumbling! They become like a fearless warrior! Similarly, for those who are new to the practice of the vows of non-violence, etc., standing on the edge of the vow, like a sharp sword, is initially difficult, and they may stumble and commit transgressions. But with repeated practice, they become firmly rooted in the vow, and not only can they stand firmly on the edge of the vow, but they can also dance gracefully upon it with restraint! This is the extraordinary feat that a stable and steadfast practitioner demonstrates! (See page 530, "The Edge of the Sword") (4) When someone first begins learning to use weapons, they may not even be able to hold the weapon properly, and there is a fear of dropping it. But after mastering the art of weaponry, a skilled warrior can wield the weapon with ease, and the weapon never slips from their firm grip. Similarly, for those who are new to the practice of the vows of non-violence, etc., they may not be able to perform these actions properly, and there may be a fear of falling. But after mastering the art of these vows, a skilled practitioner can perform them with ease, and due to their unwavering commitment, there is no chance of transgression. (5) For a novice poet, composing poetry is initially difficult, and there is a possibility of errors such as metrical irregularities. But for a mature and accomplished poet, composing poetry is easy and natural, and there is no chance of such errors. Similarly, for those who are new to the practice of the vows of non-violence, etc., it may initially be difficult, and there may be transgressions like "metrical irregularities."

Examples of practitioners

(728)
It is possible for **yogadristi** (yogic vision) and **samurchay** (harmonization) to be affected by **doshas** (faults), but for a mature, skilled, and restrained **gini** (Jain ascetic), adherence to **ahimsa** (non-violence) and other **yamas** (ethical restraints) is easy, and **yatibhang** (violation of vows) and other faults do not affect them. Thus, adherence to **yamas** is common in both **pravrittiyam** (active state) and **sthira yam** (stable state), but **doshas** like **atichaar** (excess) are possible in **pravrittiyam**, while they are impossible in **sthira yam**. This is the main difference between the two.

Another difference is that adherence to **sthira yam** is accompanied by a unique **kshayopshma** (state of diminishing passions) compared to adherence to **pravritti yam**. Just as in general education, as studies progress, the student's **kshayopshma** increases, their intellect develops, and their intellectual strength grows, so too in this **yogavidya** (yogic knowledge), as the **yogi** (practitioner) progresses in their studies, their **kshayopshma** increases, their knowledge develops, and their **charitrabal** (moral strength) grows. This allows them to further their **yogabhyas** (yogic practice) with their developed **kshayopshma** strength. Just as in physical exercise, initially only a little exercise is possible, but as the body becomes stronger through exercise, more intense exercise becomes possible, so too in **yogavyapar** (yogic practice), initially only a little practice is possible, but as the **charitra-sharira** (moral body) becomes stronger through practice, the **charitra-deha** (moral body) develops, and the **charitra-kaya** (moral body) becomes robust, more intense practice becomes possible. Thus, the adherence to **yamas** in **sthira yam** is more powerful, more energetic, more **kshayopshma**-filled, and more stable than the adherence to **yamas** in the initial stages. It is so stable that even in the midst of **achal** (immovable) movement, the **sadhak yogi** (practitioner) does not deviate from their adherence to **yamas**. The best example of this stability is found in **Shri Jin Bhagwan** (Lord Mahavira):

“**Ati rudi re ati rudi, jinjini thirata ati rudi;
Sakal pradeshe ananti, gunparyay shakti mahanti lal. Ati tasu ramane anubhavavanti, parramanje je na ramati lal. Ati par dravya je navi gamani, kshetramantaramhi na ramani lal. Ati atishyaye yage je navi dipe, parabhav bhani navi chipe lal. Ati nij tatva rase je lini, bije kin hi navi kini lal. Ati**” – **Shri Devchandraji**

And just as the **shmasarpana** (state of calmness) of **yam** adherence is present in the initial stages, it is even more present here. As the stability and firmness of **yam** adherence increases, the amount of **prashma** (calmness) happiness increases.

## Translation:

**Upas'har:**  The achievement of the fourth Yama is through the inconceivable power of the pure inner self, which is the achievement of the pararthasadhak. 

**Verse 218:**
This achievement is the pararthasadhak, the achievement of the pure inner self. It is the fourth Yama, through the inconceivable power of yoga.

**(729)**
**Ah:** This observance of Yama, which is pararthasadhak, is the achievement of the pure inner self through the inconceivable power of yoga. This is the fourth Yama, the achievement of Yama.

**Commentary:**
This observance of Yama, which is pararthasadhak, is the achievement of the pure inner self, not of another, because it has non-attachment in its presence. This is the inconceivable power of the achievement. This achievement is the fourth Yama.

The observance of Yama mentioned above, as it progresses towards purity, becomes so refined that it naturally becomes pararthasadhak. It has such inconceivable power of yoga that it effortlessly benefits others. For example, it has non-attachment in its presence, "Ahimsa pratiṣṭhāryā tat-sannidhau vaira-khyāgaḥ" (Pāta. Chā.). (See page 20, "Te ātmā-svarūpa-thī mahat 40").

Thus, this observance of Yama, which is pararthasadhak, is the achievement of the pure inner self, not of another. The inner self becomes so pure that its inconceivable influence naturally falls upon other beings, so that even violent and cruel creatures forget their innate hatred and other such powers. For example, in the presence of the Bhagavan Tīrthankara, even creatures with innate hatred forget their hatred and sit side by side with love, listening to the Dharma. For example, a doe touches a lion cub with maternal affection, a cow considers a tiger cub as her own and nurtures it, a cat becomes enamored with a snake and touches it with love, a peacock...

**Vṛtti:** This observance of Yama, which is pararthasadhak, is called the achievement of Yama. And this is the achievement of the pure inner self, not of another. Through the inconceivable power of yoga, through non-attachment in its presence, this is the fourth Yama, the achievement of Yama.

Yoga-drishti-samurachay touches the snake, - thus, with the support of a Ksheen-meh Yogi, who is equal-minded and free from the defilement of kshaya, other beings also become free from malice and abandon the innate enmity of birth.
"Sarangi Singh-shavam sprushati sutadhiya Nandini vyagrapottam, marjari Hans-balam pranay-paravasha Kekikanta bhujangam. Vairanya janma-jatanapi galit-mada jantavo'nye tyajanti, shritya lagaudu ghamit-sush yoni kshanamom" - Shri Shubhachandracharya-ji-krit
Shri Jnanav. When ahimsa is established in the soul, - when there is extreme stability, then even the caste-enmity is abandoned in the presence of the great soul, the great Gishwar. Similarly, in the establishment of satya, etc., and in the types, it has a great influence, etc., as described in the Patanjali, etc.,
Gashastra, it appears that all this is manifested in the character of the Tirthankara, like the supreme Yogi, and it is understood that it is contained in one country of the supreme Yogeshwar's unchangeable great influence. Such pure inner-soul attainment is called Siddhi, - not the attainment of miracles, etc., which produce other vehicles. Such attainment, which shows miracles, etc., and makes people bow down, is destructive to oneself and others, and makes the Yogi degenerate. In this regard, there is the supreme mental nectar of Shrimad Rajchandraji, who is supremely endowed with G-siddhi, which says -
A Samyak-drishti Purusha, who is possible in the fourth Gun-thana, has Siddhi sometimes, and sometimes he does not have Siddhi. The one who has it, does not usually desire it, and when he does desire it, it happens when the being is in a state of intoxication, and when such a desire arises, it reduces his ability to fall from Samyak-krutva. Usually, in the fifth and sixth Gun-thana, the possibility of Siddhi increases, and even there, the being who acts in Siddhi due to intoxication, etc., can be in the state of the first Gun-thana. In the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth Gun-thana, there is much scope for intoxication, and in the eleventh Gun-thana, knowing that it is possible to obtain Siddhi, it is possible to be in the state of the first Gun-thana. The rest of the places of Samyak-krutva, and
as long as the soul is Samyak-parinaami, the being cannot act in any one Yoga for three periods of time." - Shrimad Rajchandra, Patranka 369 (420)
Thus, the four types of Yama are said: Ichchha-yam, Pravritti-yam, Sthira-yam, and Siddhi-yam. Of these, Ichchha-yam is in the form of interest in the path of yoga, such as ahimsa, etc., Pravritti-yam is in the form of movement on the path, Sthira-yam is in the form of non-deviation, non-wavering movement, extreme stability,

---------------------------
**Conclusion:** The attainment of a pure soul is the same as **siddhi** (perfection), and **siddhiyam** is the attainment of the ultimate goal of the path. As the yogi progresses from **icchayaman** (desire) onwards, his self-purification increases, the momentum of **samvega** (spiritual fervor) becomes extremely rapid, the power of **kshapashama** (control over passions) grows, and finally the attainment of a pure soul is achieved.

This attainment of a pure soul encompasses the highest **yama** (self-restraint); because then the soul becomes completely non-violent due to the absence of material attachment, it does not harm itself through passions like attachment, aversion, etc.; it becomes completely truthful - it does not speak falsehoods that are harmful to others; it becomes completely non-stealing - it does not even steal a speck from others; it becomes completely celibate - it dwells in the pure self, in Brahman, and does not engage in sexual misconduct towards others; it becomes completely non-possessive, it does not have a sense of ownership even towards an atom belonging to others. Thus, having renounced all external objects and abandoned all external consequences, the yogi rests in his own nature, and constantly engages in the pure self-realization. And thus, the state of being in the pure form is called the supreme non-violence, it is called the supreme truth, it is called the supreme non-stealing, it is called the supreme celibacy, it is called the supreme non-possessiveness, and thus these five, which are perfectly fulfilled, are the very living Supreme Soul, the moving wish-fulfilling tree that is served by the blessed ones. (See poem, p. 602).

The essence of the types of **yamas** is that the five **yama-sheel-vrata** (self-restraint vows) of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possessiveness are well-known to all saints. There are four types of each **yama**: **icchayaman**, **pravrittiyam**, **sthiriyam**, and **siddhiyam**. (1) The desire for non-change in the **yama** that one is devoted to is called **icchayaman**. (2) The practice of **yama** everywhere is called **pravrittiyam**. (3) The practice of **yama** without any anxiety about violence, etc., is called **sthiriyam**. (4) The practice of **yama** that is the result of inconceivable power-yoga and benefits others, not oneself, is called **siddhiyam**. Inconceivable power-yoga leads to the renunciation of attachment. - The first two types are already attained by the active yogi, and he constantly strives for the last two types.

Yogadarisamuccaya
Sadbhih kalyanasampannairdarshanadapi pavanair. Tatha darshanato yoga adyavascaka uchyate || 219 ||
What are the saints who are blessed with auspiciousness and are pure even by their vision?
And from that vision, the yoga is called adyavachak, 219
Meaning- The yoga that happens from the vision of the blessed men who are pure even by their vision, is called adyavachak-chagavachak.
Commentary- Blessed with auspiciousness- distinguished virtuous, and pure even by their vision, such saints, without any contradiction, in that way, by quality, and from that vision, the yoga-relation that happens, is called avavachak-chagavachak.
The ga-relation that happens with the saints from that vision, means the yoga that happens with the virtuous man by knowing him in that way, is called gavachak. The way the virtuous man's "form" is, from that form-vision, from the recognition of the form, the yoga that happens with the virtuous man from that vision, the self-relation, the Brahma-relation, or the name-form recognition is called gavachak. Just by coming in external contact with the virtuous man,
just by the momentary recognition, this yoga doesn't happen, but it happens only from the vision-recognition of his form. So, the vision-recognition-identification of the form in the world of the virtuous man is the most important thing. When this inner form-vision happens, then the real yoga happens with the virtuous man. And this yoga that happens is called avachak.
What are these virtuous men? They are kalyanasampanna, meaning they are distinguished virtuous. Due to the direct attainment of the supreme gem of thought, they are supremely virtuous, they have attained auspiciousness. Such men are pure even by their vision. Even by seeing them, the soul becomes pure, they are such supremely pure souls. Their pure soul-character has such a wonderful silent influence that- other beings
Juttisaddhih valyanarampha- blessed with auspiciousness, such saints-virtuous men, with distinguished virtuous saints, navinaih- pure even by vision, pure even by observation, tatha tatha prakare, in that way, by quality-by being endowed with qualities-without any contradiction, by body-wealth, from that vision, therefore-by that, the cho-ga-relation, happens with them, bavavad uchchare- this is called avachak, this is the meaning of avachak.

Conclusion: The speed-giving (vegaachhak) due to the true vision (tathaadarshan) of the Purusha form.

(733) Seeing such a blessed, pure by vision, innocent, passionless, and detached (vitraag) Jnanee Purusha, even by their natural vision, the true seeker (mumukhu) yogi is quickly recognized due to the magical effect of their purifying vision. Because the vision of a silent Muni is infinitely more accurate than the lakhs of explanations of thousands of boastful speakers. (See page 253, "He is the nectar of all words" etc.) The natural qualities of such an Avadhoot Vitraag Muni, who is free from even his own body, are so wonderful. For example:

"The dirt becomes gold, the low becomes a king, the deceit becomes friendship, the pride becomes humility; the poison becomes medicine, the cruelty becomes miracle, the violence becomes the image of the soul, the poison becomes nectar. The world becomes a game, the earth becomes a dwelling, the time becomes family business, the shame becomes a joke; the learning becomes wisdom, the time becomes respect, such is the way of that one, bound by Banarasi."
- Poet Banarasi Dasji.

To recognize such a supremely innocent, supremely passionless, supremely detached Jnanee Purusha - Sadhujan - in their true qualities, to see them in their natural pure self-form, is "Tathaadarshan". This Tathaadarshan gives speed to the virtuous person, and their era is called Yogavanchak. - Thus, three main things are essential for the attainment of this Yogavanchak: (1) The person who is to be united (yog) must be a virtuous person, a true saint, a true Guru. (2) Their vision - association must happen. (3) Their vision - recognition must be in their true form. If even one of these is lacking, Yogavanchak does not happen.

Because (1) Firstly, the one with whom the union is to happen must be a true, virtuous person, a true saint, a true Guru who has attained the direct form of truth; they must be a true devotee of good conduct, adorned with all the virtues prescribed in the scriptures; they must be a pure, virtuous person like pure gold, sweet like nectar, pure like crystal; they must be a true "Sannyasi" who has renounced all external influences and is self-absorbed; they must be a true Nigranth - Bhavasraman, free from the bondage of external influences - possessions; they must be a "Muni" who is a self-knowing, detached Jnanee, silent towards external influences; they must be a true devotee who has directly realized the natural self-form; they must be a "Saint" who is a peaceful being, free from the illusion of form; in short, they must be "true" according to their name "Sat", they must be "Sat" - true, endowed with the direct manifestation of the soul's true form. But if such a true saint - virtuous person, endowed with the "Sat" form, is not found, and an untrue, non-saint, non-devotee, or a bad devotee is considered true, then this speed does not happen, the union does not happen.

(734)
A collection of wrong views is formed, therefore, the one with whom yoga is to be formed, should be a true, virtuous, and righteous person. Otherwise, there are many so-called saints in the world, outwardly-dressed saints, ascetics, and babas, tangled-up, name-calling yogis, and various types of deceptive, material-bodied beings. But such saints are devoid of virtues, false, like counterfeit money, material-bodied beings, from whom "nothing good comes back." The soul does not benefit in any way. (See pp. 128-129). (2) Secondly, such a virtuous person may exist, but if one does not have darshan (vision) of him, or if there is no association or acquaintance, what is the use? If a Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree) grows in the courtyard, but one does not benefit from it, what is the use? If one gets an inconceivable, precious, Cintamani gem, but does not use it to benefit oneself, what is the use? If one gets a Kamadhenu (wish-fulfilling cow), but does not worship it, what is the use? If the true nectar of liberation is raining down, but one does not absorb it, what is the use? Therefore, darshan (vision) and association with a saint is just as essential (See p. 162, "Parichay Patak Ghatak Sadhu Shunu" etc.). (3) Thirdly, if one has darshan (vision) and association with a saint outwardly, but does not have darshan (vision) of the saint's true form inwardly, or does not recognize the saint's true form, then even that outward association becomes useless, unsuccessful, and a failed darshan (vision). Or, if one has met a virtuous person, but does not have the capacity to have inner darshan (vision) and recognition, then it is as if one has not met him at all. Of these three, the third point is the most important, because even if one has a virtuous person, and even if one has outward darshan (vision) and association with him, but does not have darshan (vision) of his true form, what is the use? Because without darshan (vision) of the true form, yoga with a virtuous person becomes useless and fails. Thus, this being may have seen many times, the supreme beings like the Tirthankaras, but due to the lack of capacity of this being, he did not have darshan (vision) of the true form of those beings, therefore, that yoga was unsuccessful. Therefore, the real secret key to yoga with a virtuous person is to have darshan (vision) and recognition of his true form. And when that happens, then unshakeable yoga happens.
What is "unshakeable"? That which is not shaky, that which is not deceptive, that which does not cheat, that is unshakeable. That which never becomes empty, that which never fails, that is unshakeable, infallible, unwavering, and unfailing. That which is unwavering, a panacea, that is unshakeable. Yoga is that which does not shake, that which does not become empty, that which does not go away, that is unshakeable yoga. What is the aim of this unshakeable arrow? That is right. (See pp. 159-160, Figure 6) In the action of the arrow, the first step is to aim properly at the target (Aiming). Only after aiming properly, does the second action of releasing the arrow happen. Similarly, in this...

## Conclusion: From the Gavanchak to the Path of Life

(735) In the entirety of the Gavanchak, the first step is to firmly fix the target, the goal, which is the Sadhya. This union, this connection with the Sadhya, is called Yogavanchak. And this ultimate, decisive Sadhya is the very form itself, so the Gavanchak is the G performed with the form as the object. (See page 693)

Why then is so much emphasis placed on the Yog, the vision of the Purusha? The reason is simple: the Sapurusha is the manifest form, the direct, visible, manifest form. The G, which is the manifest form, is the G that has gained momentum. The Sapurusha is the direct, inherent, natural form of the Lord. Therefore, the vision of such a direct Yogi Purusha leaves an indelible mark on the soul of the seeker. Seeing the extraordinary self-biography of the Sapurusha, who is the form itself, the soul easily leans towards the form as the goal. What countless teachings of eloquent speakers cannot bind, can be achieved by the presence of such a Purusha. Thus, the vision of the Yogi Purusha focuses the life's goal on the Sadhya, the form as the target, and all its activities become form-oriented. Therefore, the Yog of the Purusha, who makes the form the direct goal, is called Yogavanchak.

This Gavanchak, obtained through the Yog of the Purusha, transforms the entire life cycle of the soul. What was previously the soul's conduct, focused on worldly matters, now, after becoming form-oriented, becomes solely focused on the soul. What was previously the soul's Gavanchak, where all actions and activities were detrimental to the soul, now, with the transformation of the soul's life, becomes beneficial. What was previously all means, binding in nature, now becomes true means. What was previously moving in the opposite direction, without the form as the object, becoming self-alienated, now moves in the right direction, becoming self-aware. (See Figure 20) What was previously the soul's movement, driven by Asrava-bondage, moving in the wrong direction, now becomes the soul's own form, moving in the right direction. What was previously the soul's entire momentum, actions, etc., missing the form as the target, moving crookedly, being crooked, being a Vanchak, now, with the form as the target, moves straight, becomes "A-Vankagami," becomes A-Vanchak. Such a miraculous transformation occurs in the soul. When this Gavanchak, the entire life of the Yogi, is attained by the soul, then its true "Yogi life" begins. And that is why it is called "A" - first of all, it is A-Vanchak. Only after being A-Vanchak can everything else be A-Vanchak. Otherwise, it is just Vanchak, because its previous means of Yog are all Vanchak.

The Chagadashtisusmay were like thugs, deceiving and depriving people of their true goals. (See pages 162, 163, "Yam Niyam Sayam Aap Kriya" etc. regarding the deceitful yogis.)
Thus, since time immemorial, without the Chaug of the Shrimad Sadguru, all the yogic practices of the jiva have been ineffective, but when the jiva receives the Chaug of the Shri Sadguru, those practices become effective. Such is the extraordinary power of the Chaugavchak yoga. When the jiva receives the Chaugavchak, which is like a vision of the true form of the Satpurush, the entire yogic cycle of the jiva starts functioning. Just as a wheel starts turning when it is spun, so too does the entire yogic cycle start turning when the Chaugavchak, like a spinning hand, is applied. Therefore, recognizing the true form of the Satpurush Sadguru is the most important thing. Once this happens, the yogic chariot of the jiva is set on the right track and it starts moving in the right direction. When the jiva receives the Chaug, which is like the grace of the Satpurush Sadguru who is established in his true form, the soul attains its true nature and receives the nectar of love. Sat is not a delusion, it is completely different from delusion, it is beyond imagination. Therefore, those who have a firm resolve to attain Sat should first contemplate with a firm conviction that they know nothing, and then surrender to the knower for the attainment of Sat. This will surely lead to its attainment. (See page 321)
66
"The jiva has been in the company of such knowers for countless ages, yet it has not taken refuge in them. This is because the jiva has not understood the true nature of the knower, and this is the reason for its continuous cycle of birth and death. We firmly believe this. ... We know of three major flaws in the jiva that prevent it from recognizing the knower: (1) The ego that says, "I know, I understand." (2) A greater attachment to worldly possessions than to the knower. (3) Avoiding the knower due to fear of public opinion, fear of criticism, and fear of humiliation. It should not be like this, but rather it should be drawn to the knower." - Shrimad Rajchandra. Patranka 181, 342 (211, 416)

**Conclusion:** Sadguru Yoga, Avachak Yoga, Avachak Kriya
(737) Meaning - The same is the rule of Pranamadi Kriya, the same is the Kriyavachak speed - which is the form of the rise of Mahapapakṣaya.
Discussion - The same is the Kriyavachak Yoga, the rule of Pranamadi Kriya towards that Saint; and this is the form of the rise of Mahapapakṣaya, - it destroys the low lineage.
Such as the ones mentioned above, the rule of Pranamadi Kriya towards those peaceful, tolerant, and forgiving true virtuous men - Bhavasadhus is Kriyavachak. The true Bhavagī Purusha, whose soul has attained the true form, has seen the virtuous form of the virtuous man, the Pranamadi Kriya towards that man is Kriyavachak. Here, the word 'Adi' in Bhakti should be taken as praise, chanting, conversation, service, etc. The one who sees the wonderful form of the Purusha - his virtuousness, his form becomes the target, his soul naturally falls at the feet of that Saint with devotion, he is mine. He plays in the contemplation of the virtues of that virtuous man, he likes the words of that virtuous man, he always bows at the feet of that man, his entire self-region turns towards that virtuous man - "Parigṇaman" does. Thus, he becomes engrossed in the devotional act towards that virtuous man with all the power of mind, speech, and body. (See p. 3, "Prabhupane Prabhu Olakhi" etc.) Therefore, this devotional soul continuously performs humility, respect, and honor towards the virtuous man; he places their command above his head with his body, mind, and wealth, and serves them with his whole soul; he stands with folded hands in their service, he offers his body, mind, and wealth in their service. Although the Purusha is completely detached and completely unconscious even in the body, etc., he does not expect even an atom, even then, the soul who is eager for liberation, knowing him to be his supreme benefactor, surrenders his soul at his feet - he offers himself, he offers his own soul, and he thinks, "What should I offer at the feet of the Lord?" (See p. 132, "Ah Aho Shri Sadguru" etc.)
- etc. The Pranamadi Bhakti Kriya performed towards the supremely detached, self-absorbed, virtuous man is the Kriyavachak Yoga, the same Kriya is Avachak. Kriya is such that it never stops, never misses, never goes in vain, Kriyavachak is aimed at the target - the arrow thrown at the target, its movement is towards the target, it is accurate and unwavering, it is not crooked, it is not misleading. Similarly, this Vandanadi Kriya performed with the form-target of the virtuous man in mind is also the means. 

Page #814:
---------------------------
(738)
The Yogadristi-samuccaya (the collection of yogic vision) is the form of the goal, it is unwavering and accurate, it is not crooked or deviating, it is not wavering or erring. Thus, in this example of the arrow, the arrow's unwavering movement is accurate; because the arrow is aimed at the target with unwavering speed and pursuit, its movement towards the target is also accurate and unwavering. And if the arrow is not aimed at the target with unwavering speed and pursuit, it is wavering and erring, its movement towards the target is also crooked and wavering. Similarly, if the yoga is unwavering, its action is also unwavering; and if the yoga is wavering, its action is also wavering, this is the rule.

Therefore, after the yoga, which is the form-vision-recognition of the Purusha, any action like veneration, etc., is unwavering. The action that is before that recognition is wavering, it is unsuccessful and drying up. Because this being has not kept any grains in the infinite actions of the Satpurusha from time immemorial, it has not left anything behind in the infinite effort without effort. (See p. 162) Indeed! This being has been born in the world of the beloved countless times, perfectly observing the infinite actions of the Dravya Shramanavachka. But without that feeling, all this effort of the father has gone to waste! Because this life was in the opposite direction, in the wrong direction. What is the use of cutting millions of miles in the wrong direction? Even one step in the right direction brings you closer to the goal, but this being did that, and therefore it wandered. All this failed, the reason is that it did not have the yoga of the Purusha. It may have met the Purusha many times, but it did not recognize the Satpurusha as its own form, so it did not attain welfare. If it had once recognized the form of the Purusha and offered it veneration and prostration, it would have crossed the ocean long ago! Because "one prostration to Jinavaravrushabha Vadhamana saves men and women from the ocean of samsara" - this is evident from the scriptures. If it had once offered veneration according to the scriptures, it would have realized the success of the action due to the true cause. (See p. 3, "Fuve Namuad" etc.)

Thus, it may have offered veneration, etc., to the Purusha countless times, but without recognition, this action of veneration, etc., became wavering, unsuccessful and erring! Yes, it became bound by auspiciousness, it earned merit, but the wandering towards the goal of the world did not stop; it got the many-faceted fruit of the four paths, but it did not get the one-faceted fruit of liberation! Moreover, this being was in the same delusion, even more than the wavering of infinite actions without the form of the goal, that I am doing dharma, I am striving, I am doing actions that lead to liberation. And with such a deluded belief, it...

##  Upas'har: The 'Chak Kriya' without the Yaga of a Sat Purusha (739)

They were engaging in self-talk, reading to themselves, deceiving themselves; therefore, all these actions were deceptive, misleading, and deceitful. Because under the guise of these actions, they considered themselves 'righteous', took pride in their deceptive actions, deceived their own souls, and remained deprived of the truth. In essence, all actions, including veneration, etc., after recognizing the true form of a Sat Purusha, are deceptive, and that very deceptive action is the Yaga. This deceptive Yaga is conducive to the rise of great sins, meaning it leads to the rise of great sins and the ultimate destruction of great sins. Devotion to a Sat Purusha destroys the lower karma; because serving the higher and the best makes one higher and better, therefore, by serving the supremely excellent Sat Purusha, even the name and trace of the lower karma is not left. Association with the excellent increases excellence. (See page 112, 'Uttam Gunu Anuragthi' etc.)

5 Falav'anchak Yogaastu Sadbhya Ev Niyogatah | Sanubandha Falavaptir Dharma Siddhau Satan Mata || 221 ||

Therefore, the Falav'anchak Yaga is only through the Niyog of the Saints, and the Saints agree that the attainment of the fruits of the Sanubandha is in the matter of Dharma Siddhi.

##  Discussion

And what is the last Yaga, called Falav'anchak? It is as follows: Just as we have said, through the Niyog of the Saints, by means of good teachings, etc., the attainment of the fruits of the Sanubandha in the matter of Dharma Siddhi is the Falav'anchak Yaga, which is agreed upon by the Saints.

Those who have attained the Chagav'anchak through the recognition of the true form of the Sat Purusha, and those who have attained the Yogav'anchak through the actions of veneration, etc., towards the Sat Purusha, they also attain the Falav'anchak Yaga through the great influence of the great Sat Purusha. Because if the Yaga is deceptive, then the action is also deceptive, and therefore the fruit obtained is also deceptive, like a mine. (See page 159). In this example, the attainment of the form of the object, which is like a widow to the target, is the Falav'anchak. (See page 161)

##  Vritti

Falav'anchak Yogaastu, the last and most excellent Yoga, what is it? It is as follows: Just as we have said earlier, through the Niyog of the Saints, through the Niyog, inevitably through the Sanubandha, by means of good teachings, etc., in the matter of Dharma Siddhi, the Saints agree. 

Page #816:
---------------------------
(740)
From the above, it will be clear that the fruits that the soul experienced before the identification of the man were all deceitful; because without the goal of form, this soul performed infinite actions, and it received many fruits for them, but the deceitful fruits were many, and they were in the form of worldly wandering. (See Pu. 161, "Ek Kahe Sadhiye" etc.) He received many fruits in the form of divine motion, but they were scattered and disorganized, not connected in a chain leading to a single attainable goal. Or, the fruits that were obtained were in a direction away from the one supreme fruit, which is the attainment of form, so the soul remained far away from the attainment of form, and thus, being deprived of success, all the fruits it obtained were deceitful. But now, after the non-deceitful yoga of the righteous man, the non-deceitful fruit action has also become non-deceitful, and there is definitely a non-deceitful fruit velocity due to the grace of the supremely merciful righteous man. That is, the attainment of connected fruit occurs. Connected fruit is that which is connected with another successful fruit, in which the connection of the fruit continues - it does not break. Connected fruit attainment is that in which the fruit is not scattered or disorganized, but is connected in a chain, leading in the direction of one form goal, a fruit that is conducive to liberation. Thus, the soul progresses further and further in the direction of the form goal, and comes closer to the form, due to the connection of the virtuous, which is increasingly higher from one to the next. This series of form-conducive, unbroken fruit tradition is called connected fruit or non-deceitful fruit. (See Pu. 398, "Shri Jine Sahasragame Kriyaao" etc.)
Figure 21 Connected Liberation-Conducive Fruit 0-0-0-0-0-0-> Liberation.
This connected fruit attainment and the types of good advice, etc., are due to the service of the righteous man - by "dwelling near his feet", by worship, by "Upanishad", by listening to the nectar of true words from his mouth, one attains supreme benefit, and this results in the recipient being worthy of good advice. Therefore, the fruit of all actions performed in accordance with the good advice of the righteous man, which are solitary and form-oriented, is also non-deceitful. Because the advice of the self-realized, dispassionate righteous man, who is established in form, is always directed towards the form goal. The righteous man's advice is to perform actions in the way that the attainment of yoga, which is the pure nature of the self, occurs. The advice of the righteous man, who has attained the form, is true, the true form is everywhere, so every action performed with the true form in mind is also connected with the form, and therefore bears non-deceitful fruit. (See Pu. 161, "Jivne Gyanee Purushnu"

---------------------------
Conclusion: The offering (yāga) made to the Sadguru is avacchaka (unwavering) in three ways (dravya-bhāva-thi) (741)

"The recognition (ī) and the fruit of this connection, which is called fruit attainment, is also only in the subject of dharma-siddhi, not in any other subject. Because, the satpurusha (righteous person) does not desire any other fruit except dharma-siddhi. As much as possible, the pure nature of the soul should be revealed, the soul should be established in its own nature, and the soul should attain the state of being one with its own nature, that is what they constantly desire, yearn for, and pray to the Lord. (See page 494, "Shri Simandhar Jinavar" etc.) The satpurusha never desires the fruit of Indra-chakravarti etc., which are worldly positions, but due to the influence of the dharma-ratna (jewel of dharma), which is like the incomparable Chintamani (wish-fulfilling gem), it is not difficult to attain them. The attainment of these worldly positions is also a consequence of the attainment of the yāga-ratna (jewel of offering), but it is like a shadow that follows the substance. The satpurusha does not delight in such consequential fruits, and therefore, they do not get lost in them and miss the main goal of their own nature. Because, just as an animal desires a shadow, a human being desires a worldly position. Similarly, only a worldly person desires the consequential fruits that come along with the main goal, but a learned saint does not get distracted by them; they are like a wise merchant who never forgets the main goal of their soul, which is the main goal of their soul.

Thus, this avacchaka-tripuți (three-fold unwavering) is truly comparable to the action of an arrow hitting its target; it has been explained here as much as possible. (See pages 158 to 164). From all this, it is concluded that the yoga (union) of the satpurusha with their own nature is avacchaka, and the actions of veneration etc. towards the satpurusha, who is the goal of their own nature, and their fruit are also avacchaka; and if the yoga is not avacchaka, then the actions of veneration etc. towards the goal of their own nature, and their fruit are also not avacchaka. From this, it will be clear that if the yoga is not truly avacchaka, then everything becomes unsteady. And this yoga is dependent on the Sadguru, the satpurusha, so if the yoga is not truly avacchaka due to the darshan (vision) of the Sadguru, the true person, then the action and its fruit also become unsteady. Thus, without the shelter of the feet of the saint, all the means of yoga, actions etc., become unsuccessful, become self-deceiving, and prove to be deceivers and exploiters of the soul. If one takes shelter of the true satpurusha, the bhavagya bhavasadhu (one who is worthy of devotion), then only will the yāga be avacchaka, the action be avacchaka, and the fruit be avacchaka. That is why the great sage, the author of the scriptures, has emphasized the words "siddhi" and "sadhunashritya" here. And thus, if one takes shelter of the Sadguru, and performs the yāga, which is the connection with the goal of one's own nature, and performs actions that are in accordance with that connection, and receives the fruit that is in accordance with that connection, then all three are avacchaka - the yāga is avacchaka, the action is avacchaka, and the fruit is avacchaka. (See page 164, "From the beginning of time..." etc.)

The yāga made to the Sadguru is avacchaka."

“The virtuous Sadhu, having attained devotion… the friend, the object of devotion is unwavering… the friend, the action is unwavering… the friend, the result is unwavering… the friend.” Shri Aanghanji further explains that the attainment of this threefold unwaveringness occurs in two ways: through matter and through feeling. Through matter, it means that the external, material aspect of the true, virtuous Sadhu, the Bhavasadhu, is characterized by subtle virtuousness and non-duality. This is the unwaveringness through matter. The action towards such a virtuous Sadhu, such as bowing down, etc., is the unwaveringness through action. And the fruit obtained through such material action towards such a virtuous Sadhu is the unwaveringness through result. These three unwaveringnesses through matter, which are attained by taking refuge in, honoring, and observing the true virtuous Sadhu, are also beneficial to the soul, because they become the cause of the threefold unwaveringness through feeling. Through feeling, it means that the inner, subtle aspect of the true virtuous Sadhu, the Bhavasadhu, is characterized by subtle virtuousness and non-duality. This is the unwaveringness through feeling. The feeling of devotion, bowing down, etc., towards such a virtuous Sadhu is the unwaveringness through action. And the feeling of Dharma Siddhi, the attainment of liberation, obtained from such a virtuous Sadhu is the unwaveringness through result. Alternatively, the soul's attainment of its true form through the teachings of the Sadguru and the good conduct of the soul is the unwaveringness through action. Then, the action of the soul in accordance with its true form is the unwaveringness through action, and the attainment of the true form, the attainment of self-realization, is the unwaveringness through result. Thus, whoever attains the threefold unwaveringness through matter or through feeling is eligible for this practice of devotion and effort. However, the feeling is more important. In both these ways, the main point is that this threefold unwaveringness should be attained through taking refuge in the virtuous Sadhu, the true, genuine Bhavasadhu, by honoring and taking refuge in him. What more? The essence of the matter is that the recognition of the virtuous Sadhu's true form is the unwaveringness through object. The action of bowing down, etc., towards the virtuous Sadhu, recognizing him as the virtuous Sadhu, is the unwaveringness through action. And the fruit of Dharma Siddhi, the attainment of liberation, obtained from the virtuous Sadhu is the unwaveringness through result. Alternatively, recognizing the true form is the unwaveringness through object, practicing the true form is the unwaveringness through action, and attaining the true form is the unwaveringness through result.
The threefold unwaveringness through matter and feeling
The collection of yogic perspectives
E
Thus, the nature of this is explained by the author of the Prakrutiyojan:
“Even for those who are dull-witted, who are not yogis, there is benefit from hearing, from being free from bias, etc., from this collection of yogic perspectives.” (222)
Commentary:
“Hayoginaam” – those who are not yogis, “kulaadiyoginaam” – those who are not yogis, etc., “asmaan” – from this, “matto’ashi” – even more than me, “gadhimataam” – those who are dull-witted, “shravanat” – from hearing, “pakshapaataat” – from bias, “shubhechchhaa” – from good wishes, “aadin” – etc., “leshathi” – slightly, “upakaara” – benefit, “chhe” – is, “tathaprakaare” – in this way, “khijapushti” – by strengthening the mind, “vade” – by means of, “karine” – by doing.

Conclusion: This text may benefit even those like Kulgi, who are dull-witted, 
(743) Kulgi and others, even those with dull intellect, 
By listening, they may benefit even slightly from the bias, etc., 222. Meaning - This collection of Gadashtti, even those with dull intellect like Kulgi, etc., who are even more dull than me, by listening to this, they may benefit even slightly from the bias, etc., that arises.
Discussion: Those like Kulgi, etc., who have the above mentioned characteristics, who are even more dull than me, even they may benefit slightly from this collection of Gadashtti, due to the bias, good wishes, etc., that arise from listening to this, and due to the strengthening of the second, etc.
Compassion, peace, equality, forgiveness, 
Truth, renunciation, detachment;
May be in the pot of the seeker, these are always awake. - Shri Atmasiddhi. As mentioned above, - those who are born in the Gikul and have attained the Gidharma from birth, and others who are also followers of the Gidharma by nature, by substance and by feeling, are the Kulgis. These great Kulgis and the Pravritchakras, due to the lack of attachment, are full of diseases in the world, due to the influence of Dharma, they are dear to the Guru, Dev, and Dwij, 
and due to the lack of Kilsht and sin, they are compassionate by nature, due to the good deeds, they are humble and polite, due to the understanding of the knots, they are knowledgeable and understand the truth, and due to their character, they are self-controlled. And the Pravritchakras are the ones who take refuge in the first two types of Yama - Ichchhayam and Pravrittiyam, and the other two Yamas - Sthiraayam and Siddhiyam, they are always engaged in virtuous activities. And therefore, they are endowed with eight virtues like Shushrusha, etc. And due to the attainment of the Awanchak, they have benefited from the other two Awanchaks, i.e., due to the attainment of the Yegavanchak, they have also attained the Kriyavanchak and Falavanchak. - These great Kulgis and Pravritchakras are the ones who are entitled to this great fourfold experiment, says the Gavid. Meaning - This Yugprayog is suitable for those who are worthy, those who have these characteristics, those who are endowed with these excellent qualities, those who are true seekers, those who are true souls, that is the meaning here.
And addressing these special qualified Megis, the great Yegis, the great scholar, the Maharshi says - Among these Kulgis and Pravritchakras,

This "Gadashti Laghuta Darshan Samuchchay" text will be of some benefit even to those who are more dull-witted than I am. The great scholar Mahatma, through this word, has shown in a very simple way the extreme humility of the father, and has also suggested who this text will be particularly beneficial to. Because in the phrase "even more dull-witted than I am," the word "even" acknowledges his own dull-wittedness in a humble way. So I am indeed dull-witted, but I hope that this will be of some benefit to those souls who are even more dull-witted than I am. Because the development of intellect is in proportion to the soul's क्षोपशम (kshaypashma), that is, the intellect's sharpness and old-fashionedness is in proportion to the क्षपशम (kshaypashma) of the karma-covering. So even though I am one with a weak क्षोपशम (kshaypashma), I hope that this work will be of some benefit to those who are even weaker in क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma) than I am, those who are our soul-relatives. Here, the word "a little" is also indicative of humility. Because this text is not just a little beneficial to the seeker, it is supremely beneficial, yet it is said to be "a little" beneficial. Moreover, there is also a deeper meaning to calling the father "dull-witted." Because whatever क्षयोपशम (kshaypashma) there is, it is weak in energy and strength compared to the क्षायिक (kshaayik) state, and is dull-witted. So even those who have the most excellent क्षयोपशम (kshaypashma) are considered dull-witted and weak compared to the क्षायिक (kshaayik) state. Therefore, it is not appropriate to help even those with the most क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma), and so the author, the great sage, says that even though I have a weak क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma), I am dull-witted, yet those who have a weaker क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma) than I do will be able to benefit from this. Because it is the way of things that those with a weaker क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma) learn from those with a stronger क्षयपक्षम (kshaypashma), just as those who are less learned can learn from those who are more learned. (See page 94, "अपवीर્ય ક્ષેપશમ અછે" (apveery kshaypashma ache) etc.) Thus, this great sage, Haribhadracharya, who is truly dyed through and through with the color of spirituality, has revealed his true greatness by expressing extreme humility. Because, "Humility is where greatness resides, and greatness is where the Lord is far away."
Here, it is said that there will be some benefit, but what benefit is it, and how will it happen? This is also explained here. It is like this: by listening to this scripture, these great, worthy, and qualified seekers will receive benefits such as partiality, good wishes, etc., and thus they will be benefited in some way by being strengthened with the seed of the right path. These great souls will listen to this scripture, and because of their natural inclination towards virtue, they will develop partiality towards it, good wishes will arise, devotion will flourish, they will gain knowledge of the true path, and their desire to walk on that path will grow. Therefore, they will attain...

##  Preface: The Author's Humility, How Can There Be Benefit?
(745)

"The confirmation of the existing vows will be achieved, the pure devotion will blossom as a means, and the tree of sacrificial fulfillment will flourish and bear the fruit of liberation, the supreme nectar. Thus, even these ascetics will benefit from this scripture. Moreover, the word 'something' is used to indicate the secondary nature of the benefit to others. Because the author's opinion is that others will benefit from this 'something', but the main benefit, the main self-benefit, is mine. This scripture, as I said before, is composed to remind the soul, so the main purpose of this scripture is to benefit my own soul, to achieve my own soul's liberation. It is secondary that other ascetic souls may benefit from this scripture. They are most worthy to receive it! They too may achieve their desired self-benefit from this! They are all invited to do so with utmost love! I have composed this to partake in the supreme nectar of liberation, and those who are aware, may dive deep and partake in this supreme nectar of sacrifice and be satisfied! And experience the realization of the supreme soul!"

##  Addressing the Doubt of Bias
To dispel the doubt that benefit can only arise from bias, it is said:

"The essence of bias and action devoid of emotion, these two should be understood as distinct, like the sun and the moon." (223)

Meaning: The essence of bias and action devoid of emotion, their distinction should be understood like the sun and the moon.

##  Commentary
Pure emotion and empty action, the difference between them is vast;
Like the blazing sun and the moon, their brilliance is distinct. - Shri Cha. Sa. 8-6.

Here, the doubt is dispelled that benefit can only arise from bias. The author has stated the intention of benefiting others. 'Tattvik' means that which is transcendental, 'Tattvik Pakshapat' means transcendental bias, 'Bhavashoonya' means action devoid of emotion. The distinction between these two should be understood like the sun and the moon, which are vastly different. 

Page #822:
---------------------------
(746)
Yogadristi Samuccaya is biased, and action without emotion is neutral. The difference between these two is so vast that it can be compared to the distance between the sun and a firefly. The blazing sun and the flickering fireflies, the distance between these two lights is the same as the distance between the biased and the neutral action. The biased is like the sunlight, and the neutral action is like the firefly light. So the biased is much greater.

Someone might doubt that what benefit is there in just having bias towards this subject? The benefit comes from action, how can it come from just a biased interest? The answer to this is given in the above example. This Ganasastra, the biased towards the subject, the philosophical bias, the true emotional bias, the benefit from this is not a small matter, because such bias does not arise without inner interest and love, it does not arise without inner emotion. So the value of this emotional bias arising from inner interest and emotion is as much as we can estimate, and compared to the infinite material action that we do without emotion, it is the extremely small value of that emotionless action. If one person has true emotion and only bias towards this subject, and does not do any Yogasadhana action, and another person does infinite material action without discrimination and emotion, the difference between these two is as much as the distance between the sun and the firefly. Even the one who has only bias with emotion is infinitely greater than the one who does infinite action without emotion. The emotional bias is like the sun, and the emotionless action is like the firefly. So how can these two be compared? Where is the mountain, where is the mustard seed? Where is the ocean, where is the drop? Where is the sun, where is the firefly?

“Those who are engrossed in external action, have no discrimination;
The path of knowledge is forbidden, such action is inert.” Shri Atmasiddhi “Mariya: Itijarjari Na Mavaacha” - Shri Kalyanumandhir Stotra.

And the bias that is being talked about here is the philosophical bias. Philosophical means understanding the ultimate truth, the ultimate truth, the ultimate truth, the bias that arises naturally towards it, understanding the ultimate truth, that is the philosophical bias. There is a lot of difference between this philosophical bias and the non-philosophical bias, it is the distance between heaven and earth, because the bias arising from the desire for votes, the bias arising from the ego of the vote, that is non-philosophical. In that, “mine is true”

##  Upas'har: The Inseparability of  Tattvik  Bias and Emotionless Action (747)

The essence of such a sentiment lies in the fact that the bias arising from the true understanding of the true nature of the Self (Sat-swaroop) is Tattvik. In this, the feeling of "this is mine" is paramount. In A-tattvik bias, opinion takes precedence, while in Tattvik bias, 'Sat' (Truth) takes precedence. A-tattvik bias is rooted in attachment to opinion, while Tattvik bias is rooted in the understanding of Truth. This is the key difference between the two. Just as A-tattvik bias is undesirable and harmful, Tattvik bias is desirable and beneficial. This Tattvik bias is the one presented here, and it is the most desirable because it arises from the inner interest, understanding, and feeling towards the true object due to the love born from virtue. What a pure feeling-based bias this is! In its presence, inert material action is insignificant, like a firefly in front of the sun. From this, it is essential to understand that the emphasis should be infinitely more on feeling than on external material action. However, the compassionate saints, saddened by the opposite situation prevalent among people, have lamented:

"Material action is the lifeblood, but devoid of feeling,
Even the teachers are like that, what will they do for the new life?.... Chandranan" - Shri Devchandraji

And they say in the same vein:

"The brilliance of the firefly is small and perishable,
The brilliance of the sun is the opposite, this is the understanding of the wise." - 224

A: The brilliance of the firefly is small and perishable, and the brilliance of the sun is the opposite, this is the understanding of the wise, this is worthy of contemplation.

**Discussion**

The luminous brilliance of the insect called Khadyaut is small and perishable in nature. And the luminous brilliance of the sun is the opposite, meaning it is vast and imperishable.

**Interpretation:**

The essence of the firefly, which is luminous, is small and perishable. The brilliance of the sun is the opposite, meaning it is vast and imperishable. This is the understanding of the wise, worthy of contemplation, based on the authoritative bias, through action and other things, by the wise. 

Page #824:

(748)
Yoga-drishti-samuccaya
It is imperishable. Such is the feeling. Through this presented bias, these action-etc. wise ones are worthy of feeling through tattva-niti.
The example of the sun-firefly given above is clarified here:- "There is a small creature named firefly, which is also called a glowworm, which shines in the part of the night. Its luminous brilliance, in its form, is small and perishable. It shines, flickers, and glows every now and then, in which it itself is not really visible, it makes faint flashes for a moment, and then disappears somewhere. But the luminous brilliance of the sun is the opposite. The brilliance of the sun is great and imperishable. It shines brightly, sparkles, in which the whole world substance is truly illuminated, it casts an extraordinary brilliant and imperishable light, and thus it continuously shines for a long time. This is a well-known example.
Where is the sun? Where is the firefly?
From this example, the wise ones, the learned ones, the discerning gentlemen, should consider the ultimate meaning through tattva-niti - they are worthy of feeling. The future mechanical material action is like a firefly, its brilliance is small and perishable; and the feeling-like tattvic bias is like the sun, its brilliance is great and imperishable. The visible action shines, flickers, and glows every now and then, like the firefly, it makes faint flashes for a moment, in which its own form is not even visible, and it disappears somewhere, its trace is not found. But the presented feeling, like the sun, shines brightly, sparkles, in which its own self-form, what it is, is also illuminated, the whole world form is illuminated, it casts an extraordinary brilliant and imperishable knowledge-light; and thus it continuously shines, the imperishable luminous feeling. Thus, in front of the infinite and imperishable luminous sun, the firefly-like insect's faint glow appears as faint as it is; similarly, in front of the infinite and imperishable luminous knowledge-light spreading feeling, the whole material action cycle appears as small and perishable; therefore, material action is not in any calculation compared to the pure feeling, which is the tattvic bias. Etc. is worthy of feeling.
Feeling: Material action is like a firefly
This
The main people who mechanically perform material action believe that our welfare will happen, but it is their delusion; because Shri
While performing action, Haribhadracharya Ji has

**Conclusion:**

** भाव सुय समे: द्रव्य किया खद्योत समी** (749)

The Pancha-shastra clearly states that "Even a complete action is not an action without भाव (emotion); because it has the alternative of its own fruit. Here is an example of उपपात (secondary consequence) from the second."

In this regard, the Agam says that - from the flow of time, this being has been placed in countless bodies in the Chaiveyak (heavenly realm), meaning this being is born countless times in the Chaiveyak Devalok (heavenly realm). And this attainment of the Chaiveyak is not without the observance of the complete action of the Sadhu (saint), but is only possible through the observance of the complete action of the Sadhu in the best way. Thus, even though the complete action of the Sadhu is attained countless times, the being's welfare is not achieved! Indeed, even Darshan (spiritual insight) is not attained! The reason for this is the lack of appropriate भाव. From this, the importance of भाव is evident.

**Special Note:**

श्रवणे प्रार्थनीयाः स्युन हि योग्याः कदाचन । यत्नः कल्याणसत्त्वानां महारत्ने स्थितो यतः ॥२२५॥

**श्रवणे प्रार्थना एग्य ने, कदी योग्य जन रत्न:**
**स्थित छे कल्याणसने, महारत्नमा यत्न, 225.**

Meaning - Worthy people are never to be requested for श्रवण (listening), because their effort is already established in the great treasure of the welfare of beings.

**Commentary:**

Worthy people are never to be requested for श्रवण, because due to their भाव of श्रुश्रुषा (eagerness to listen), they are naturally inclined towards it. The effort of the कल्याणसत्त्व (virtuous beings) is already established in the great treasures like the Chintamani (wish-fulfilling gem), etc. - thus, due to the appropriateness and lack of bias, they attain it in their births. This is what is heard in the scriptures.

Such worthy yogis, who are mentioned above, are never to be requested for श्रवण. Oh, you who are engaged in the cycle of action! Oh, you who are engaged in the cycle of action!

O seekers of liberation, travelers on the path of liberation, who are united in the vision of yoga! O great, righteous, soul-bound seekers of the path of liberation! Listen to this scripture! Partake of this direct nectar of liberation and attain supreme bliss! - and so on. This type of prayer is not necessary for the seeker of liberation, the worthy person; because due to their eagerness to listen, due to their true inner desire to listen, their participation in the constant listening of the scriptures is automatic. So, where is the space to inspire them to listen or to make a prayer in the form of an announcement? Their desire to listen to the true scriptures, their eagerness to listen, is so intense that they are already engaged in it on their own, without being told to do so. Because, just as the seeker of liberation is certain to attain liberation, the effort of the worthy person in this great, virtuous gem is already established, it does not need to be established. Because, in this way, they have the appropriate yoga, it is appropriate for them to do so, so they will inevitably do so automatically. It is stated in the scriptures that due to bias, etc., such eagerness to listen, etc., is attained in past lives. Due to the inherent bias of the great souls towards constant listening, they will inevitably attain such eagerness to listen, etc., even in past lives. So, what is the point of saying, "Listen to this! Listen to this!" to such worthy people who are inherently biased towards the scriptures, who are eager to listen, who are inherently interested in the scriptures, and who are already engaged in listening with great enthusiasm?

To those who are not worthy, it is said to avoid the sin of giving:
नैतद्विदस्त्वयोग्येभ्यो ददत्येनं तथापि तु । हरिभद्र इदं प्राह नैतेभ्यो देय आदरात् ॥ २२६ ॥ 
अग्यने ते गवि६, दीए न एह छतांय;
हरिभद्र सादर कहे, एने देय न आ ય, ૨૨૬ 
Meaning - But those who know this (the teachers) do not give this scripture to those who are not worthy. However, Haribhadra has said with respect that this should not be given to them. 
Kritti - Naitih - Those who do not know this, the teachers, A yogye - and, those who are not worthy, others, Ri - giving, giving, Inan - this Yogadrishti Samuchaya named scripture, Tathapi Tathapi, even so, systematically, Rimo - Haribhadra, the author, Hun Kadu - this has been said. What? That is to say - Na Aane - to those who are not worthy, Revad - giving this Yogadrishti Samuchaya, Bavaran - with respect, this has been said with respect. 

Page #827:
---------------------------
Conclusion: What is not worthy is not given, and what is not suitable is not given.
(751) Discussion: "The assembly, the three qualities of the listener, the merits and demerits, the ten principles of the Nand Sutra; knowing this, this text should be given, the good qualities will be spread in the world." - Ye. Saza. 8-8 But the Acharyas who know this, they do not give this text, which is a collection of yogic insights. Even though it is organized in this way, the author Haribhadra has said with respect that this text is not suitable to be given to those who are not suitable.
Above, it was said that this text will be somewhat beneficial to those who are yogis, and that there is no need to request them to listen to it, because they are already engaged in it with interest. After that, the question arises slightly, what is this text for? Why is it avoided? Why is there no encouragement to give it to those who are not suitable to listen to it? What wrong has it done? Here, the answer is given clearly that the wise men who know this path of liberation, the Acharyas, do not give this text to those who are not worthy. Even so, Haribhadra says with respect that this text is not suitable to be given to those who are not suitable. The Acharyas do not give this text to those who are not worthy, but the author of this text, who is the embodiment of compassion and sweetness, says with respect, in a soft voice, with explanation, with understanding, with sweetness, with humility, that this text is not suitable to be given to those who are not worthy, so that they do not feel wrong, so that their soul does not suffer, so that they are explained with respect, with compassion, and with reason.
This text is not given to those who do not have the "yogic quality" mentioned above, who do not have the capacity to truly understand, grasp, or absorb this supreme secret. Because those who are not worthy, who cannot digest this supreme yogic principle with proper understanding, who cannot assimilate it, who cannot become the cause of its negation, this text can have the opposite effect, causing false pride, indigestion, or "upset to knowledge"! Just as nutritious food does not digest for those with weak digestive power, but instead causes indigestion, so too, this supreme knowledge does not digest for those who are not qualified, and not only that, but it also causes false pride, thinking, "I am a yogi," and without achieving the yogic state, without attaining the state of knowledge, they start talking big about yogic knowledge everywhere, and show off their scholarship! In this way, the scriptures are not digested!

:
“Knowledge spoken from the mouth, but the inner self remains untouched;
Such a creature, only betrays the knower.” —Shri Atmasiddhi
“One’s own self is true, the mind is not spent, one reads the scriptures,
But if one is deceitful and does not value the truth, then one’s vows are not fulfilled.” —Sa, Tr. Ga, St.

Furthermore, the scriptures mention three types of assemblies – audiences. Accordingly, there is a style – a method – for the teacher to deliver teachings after examining the virtues and vices of the listener. If an unworthy listener is taught something inappropriate for them, it will be counterproductive, because they are not capable of absorbing it and it will lead to further harm. The nature of this type of listener can be understood from the Shri N...di Sutra:

“We should speak to those who have a secret desire, who break through the inner self, whose mind is pure, to them it is not appropriate;
The appropriate and inappropriate divisions are separate, one should speak accordingly,
Those who are capable will be in the assembly of the learned, they will be able to withstand blows and kicks.” —Ya. 6, Sajja, 8-7

There are listeners who are like the roar of a lion, who hear the roar from afar and are frightened, become terrified, and flee, so why would they come before it? Similarly, there are listeners who are like a herd of deer, who hear the clear, heroic, naked truth, and are tormented, become terrified, and flee! So why would they stand before it and listen? Such listeners, who are like a herd of deer, who are accustomed to the old ways, who are dull and foolish, how can they absorb this truth? And this speech of the Chaug Granth is like the roar of a true hero, like the roar of a lion, so why would creatures like deer, who are of low character, be worthy of hearing it? Because the naked truth, the ultimate truth, is revealed here. The method of pure Yagbhav, which unites with the pure nature of the soul, is embedded in it. Why would cowardly creatures of low character be worthy of absorbing such a heroic roar, like the roar of a lion?

*
Among them, those who are like a herd of deer, who are tormented by hearing it! A herd of deer…

Just as cowards flee in fear upon hearing the heroic song of a valiant man who says, "I will die," or "Death is my subject," so too, upon hearing the words of this valiant Chaugaveer, the lowly beings flee in fear. What is surprising about this? Because here, it is the story of "Nagad Narayan," the story of the "Hirna Marag Kaldaar" in the form of a deer, and the story of the spiritual culmination of the feelings of the "Shura." It is the story of the "Chauga Vijay" or the "Subhat," who, like a warrior, consumes himself in the process of performing sacrifices. "First, place your head down, then take the name, you see!" - It is the story of taking the name of this Chauga after first placing your head down. It is the story of moving forward on the path of Chauga, with a heart free from deceit, and surrendering oneself. It is the story of the ultimate heroic act of showing "Vipan" in one's own place. This "Hir" - the one who conquers the "Kam" - is the path of the "Prabhu," the path of the "Shura," and it is not the work of a coward. (See page 8, "Veerpanu Te Atamthane" etc.).
4
"The path of the "Hir" is the path of the "Shura," it is not the work of a coward, you see;
First, place your head down, then take the name, you see." - Shri Pritam Bhakt
Due to these reasons, the wise Acharyas never give such an excellent Chauga-related text into the hands of the "Ayogya." That is why the author of this text, Shri Haribhadracharya, says that this text is not suitable for the "Ayogya." And we are not saying this out of disrespect or contempt for the "Ayogya" beings, but we say it respectfully; because we have no hatred towards those beings, nor do we disrespect or despise them, but we have equal regard for all beings, and towards such "Ayogya" beings, we have a special feeling of compassion, that if these beings were to attain this path of Chauga, how good it would be! But for that, they must also acquire the necessary qualifications. Once they acquire the qualifications, they too will become eligible for this. Therefore, just as the "Yogya" should strive to increase their qualifications, so too, the "Ayogya" should strive to acquire qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discouraged at all. Because as they increase their qualities of detachment, calmness, etc., they will become eligible. Therefore, they should strive to increase their detachment, etc. But until such qualifications have come, they are not eligible for this. That is why we have said this respectfully, and that too only for the benefit of those beings. Because it is a general rule that a doctor should examine the patient's pulse properly, understand their nature, and administer medicine keeping in mind their age, digestive capacity, etc. If he does not do so,

With respectful salutations to Haribhadraji.

If the dosage of the Yogadristi Samuchaya meant for an adult is given to a child, how much harm will it cause? What kind of adverse results will it bring? What kind of imbalance will be created? Just as a skilled physician, a Sadguru should also carefully observe the pulse and nature of a worldly being, taking into account their age, digestive capacity, and other factors, and provide spiritual treatment accordingly. If they do not do so, and give the dosage of teachings suitable for an adult or a learned person to a child, how much harm will it cause? What kind of adverse results will it bring? Keeping this analogy in mind, we clearly prohibit giving this Yogadristi Samuchaya to someone who is not ready for it. This is what Shri Haribhadrasuri says.

Why is this so? Because:

"Even a small amount of disrespect, if done towards this, becomes a great harm. Therefore, it was said for the sake of remedy, not out of any personal bias." (227)

Here, even a small amount of disrespect shown towards this Yogadristi Samuchaya text, due to its profound subject matter, becomes a great harm. Therefore, Haribhadra said this for the sake of remedy, not out of any personal bias.

Here, even a small amount of disrespect shown towards this text called Yogadristi Samuchaya, due to its profound subject matter, becomes a great harm. Therefore, Haribhadra said this for the sake of remedy, not out of any petty personal bias.

In the above verse, when it is said that "Haribhadra says that this should not be given," what is the reason for this statement? This is clearly explained here. If even a small amount of disrespect is shown towards this Yogadristi Samuchaya text, it will become a great harm for the one who disrespects it.

"Even a small amount of disrespect, if done towards this, becomes a great harm. Therefore, it was said for the sake of remedy, not out of any personal bias." (227)

"Just as a medicine that is beneficial for the wind can be harmful for phlegm, so too, the medicine of true Dharma can be harmful for those who are not ready for it." - Shri Haribhadrasuri Padshaka.

**Upas'haar: The reason for not giving it to the unworthy - even a slight disregard leads to great anath (75)**

Because the subject of this text is great, therefore disregard for it also leads to great anath. Therefore, Haribhadra has said this to prevent such great anath from arising from giving it to the unworthy, not because of a feeling of inferiority.

This collection of 8 yogadrishtis is a text related to the great fourfold subject, therefore this yogashastra is also great because of its great subject matter. Knowing or not knowing this great yogashastra, even a slight disregard, even by mistake, will lead to great anath - it will become a great loss for the one who disregards it; because even a slight disregard, even a slight disrespect, even a slight lack of courtesy, even a slight disrespect, even a slight lack of devotion towards the great truth will lead to the terrible fruit of endless samsara paribhramana. Just as great happiness is obtained from respect, courtesy, devotion, and honour towards the great truth, so too is unhappiness obtained from disrespect, disrespect, lack of courtesy, lack of devotion, and lack of honour. Just as great happiness is obtained from worship, so too is great unhappiness obtained from opposition. Just as a king, when pleased, grants justice and when displeased, even destroys a house, so too, when pleased, the truth brings about the welfare of the soul, and when displeased, it brings about great misfortune. A satpurusha and the nectar of his words are the saviour from samsara. Devotion to him leads the soul across the ocean, and disrespect causes the soul's boat to sink! That is why Shri Viravijayaji has truly sung in the praise of puja: "Do not disrespect the tirtha, do not disrespect the tirtha, do not disrespect the tirtha." (See page 110, "Chakri Dharma Tirthathano" etc.)

If even a slight disregard for such a great shastra leads to great anath, then what to say about greater disregard? And if such a great shastra is given to the unworthy, it is possible that they will disregard it, disrespect it, etc. I will explain - and if that happens, they will suffer great anath, they will have to suffer the pain of endless samsara paribhramana. Therefore, Haribhadra has said that it is not appropriate to give this to the unworthy, so that they do not suffer great anath, so that great anath stays away, not because of a feeling of inferiority, that is, not because of inferiority or triviality. The great soul Haribhadracharya says that we have no hatred, no envy, no lack of anything towards these unworthy beings, so that we would have forbidden them from receiving this shastra because of inferiority or trivial thoughts. We are not like that, we do not forbid these ignorant beings from receiving this shastra because of their ignorance.

This text, the *Gadasimuccaya*, is written with the intention of preventing the accumulation of negative karma. It is written with compassion and for the benefit of the reader. Therefore, do not be upset or angry with the author, but instead try to cultivate the qualities of a good listener and first try to remove your own negativity.  It is important to avoid even the slightest disrespect towards this sacred text. This is the intention of the author. For example, giving this text to someone who is not receptive, who does not have a genuine desire to listen, or who is not interested in the subject matter, is equivalent to disrespecting this great text. It is like offering a *bhagavat* to a buffalo or throwing pearls before swine. Therefore, it is not appropriate to give this text to those who lack the qualities of a good listener.

This is a duty that must be undertaken. As it is said:

*योग्येभ्यस्तु प्रयत्नेन देयोऽयं विधिनान्वितैः । मात्सर्यविरहेणोच्चैः श्रेयोविघ्नप्रशान्तये ॥ २२८ ॥*

This text should be given to worthy listeners, with effort, by those who are qualified, without any jealousy, for the sake of removing obstacles to liberation.

**Commentary:**

This text is not meant for unworthy listeners, as explained above. However, it is essential to give it to worthy listeners, without any jealousy, and with effort. This should be done by those who are qualified in the matters of listening and other related practices. Otherwise, there is a risk of negative consequences. The author emphasizes the importance of giving this text with effort, by those who are qualified, and without any jealousy, for the sake of removing obstacles to liberation.

## Yoga Disamucchaya (058)

If this is given by someone who has not themselves heard (Shravana) etc., it is Avidhyan (ignorance). Because, how absurd is it for someone who has not themselves heard (Shravana) etc., to give it to others, to make them hear? How senseless is it? And thus, if it is given by someone who is not qualified, it leads to blame due to the possibility of the recipient's (Pratyavayana) acceptance, as Shri Aachaarya Bhagavate says.

Therefore, just as there is a need for a worthy listener (Shrota), there is an even greater need for a worthy speaker (Vakta) - a compassionate teacher (Vyakhyata). Only someone who is knowledgeable (Jagnu), wise (Sujanu), learned (Jnani), experienced (Anubhavi), and a true speaker of the Gita (Gita Vakta) is qualified to give teachings (Upadesh) and can give good teachings (Sadupadesh). But if the speaker is ignorant (Ajagnu), uninformed (Ajnani), inexperienced (Khinanubhavi), and not a true speaker of the Gita (Agitaatha Gita Jnani Vakta), then they can never be qualified to give teachings (Upadesh). And if such a person climbs onto the platform (Vyakhyanpith) and pretends to be a speaker (Vakta Khaji),

showing off their eloquence (Vachalpana) for the sake of praise (Manava) and worship (Poojava), then they are only acting ignorantly (Avidhiye Vatata) and betraying the trust of the learned (Jnani). Therefore, only a virtuous person (Satpurush) who is qualified in the rituals of hearing (Shravana) etc., experienced in the path of liberation (Chaugmag), compassionate (Bhavyogi), and a true speaker of the Gita (Gita Jnani) is worthy of being a teacher of this path of liberation (Chaugmag). Only from such a good teacher (Sadupadeshta) can good teachings (Sadupadesh) be received, and only from such a great teacher (Mahatma Sadupadeshta) can the path (Mag) be followed.

*

"A good teacher is very necessary. A good teacher is very necessary." - Shrimad Rajchandraji

And the giving of this knowledge (Jnandaan) by such good teachers (Sadupadeshta) - virtuous people (Satpurush) - is also extremely beneficial for the sake of peace (Prashaanati) of the knowledge of one's own good (Shreyavidhmani), and for the sake of peace (Prashaanati) of the obstacles (Vighna) in the path of virtue (Punyantaraay). Because, such acts of giving knowledge (Jnandaan) - the highest good deeds (Param Satkaryan) - bring peace (Prashaanati) to the obstacles (Vighna) in one's own good (Shreyavidhni) - one's own welfare (Atmakalyan). It brings extreme peace (Atyant Prashaanati). In other words, it brings peace (Prashaanati) - extreme peace (Atyant Shaanti) - to the obstacles (Antaraya) in the virtue (Punya) that is connected to virtue (Puny anubandhi). Therefore, by giving such sacred scriptures (Shashtra), the obstacles (Antaraye) to one's own attainment of good (Shreyaprapti) are removed, and thus one attains the nectar-like (Maksharoop) success (Safalni) of the highest good (Param Shruti). Thus, since these sacred scriptures (Param Satshastra) themselves bring peace (Prashaanati) to the obstacles (Shreyavighna) in one's own good, their giving (Daan) also brings peace (Prashaanati) to the obstacles (Shreyavighna) in one's own good (Sw-Parne). Therefore, with a selfless (Nishkaam) attitude of welfare (Bhavana) for one's own welfare (Atmakalyanu),

**Conclusion:  Shreyavighaprashanti and Continuous Giving: Kalash Kavya**

(759)  In order to bring about the influence of the Supreme Being, the virtuous teachers, the good men, have given the knowledge of this virtuous scripture for the sake of the peace of the Shreyavins.  So be it!

"Filled with their own desires, with the qualities of yoga-bhaav, the wise followers of Shri Nayavijay, the readers, are praised." -  Sakshat. 88

- Conclusion Kalash Kavya -

The ocean of many scriptures, like the Vasantatilaka Sagar, was churned, this beautiful, well-written scripture, full of wisdom, emerged.  The wise ones extracted the nectar from the ocean of milk, the wise Shri Haribhadra planted it.  167

The essence is like pure butter, this is the essence of the scripture.  The wise one has summarized it concisely, the meaning of the self, the meaning of the world, the meaning of the Supreme.  168

The summary is the complete path, this is an unprecedented, excellent power of synthesis.  The seed is in the tree, and the tree is in the seed.  169

Each sutra is a treasure trove, in the point, the accomplished is known.  For the sake of guidance, the wise one has explained it in detail.  170

The yogis are like the light that illuminates the world, the nectar of nectar, Shri Haribhadra Deva.  Oh, what can be said about his speech?  What can be said about the greatness of Vamana in the realm of heaven?  171

For those who are engaged in the cycle of action, this is beneficial and useful.  This scripture of yoga is the right of those who are seeking liberation from the world through the self.  172

Those who are engaged in the cycle of action, those who are followers of the true Dharma, are free from hatred, they love God, the Guru, and the twice-born.  They are humble, compassionate, and have conquered their senses.  173

Those who have received the good qualities from their parents, who are the light of their family, those sons of good families, who are well-behaved, do not take on the qualities of their family.  174

The eight qualities, such as Shreshtha, are clearly evident.  Desire, action, and the two Yamas are present.  The yogis are known as those who are engaged in the cycle of action, who are eager for the stability and attainment of the Yamas.  175

The actions of the senses, the cycle of karma, are for the sake of others.  Now, the cycle of action for the sake of the self has emerged.  The self is the action of the self, the self is the action of the self, the great soul acts from the self.  176

The nature of the self is not destroyed by division, the self is not taught as something other than the self.  The self does not destroy the substance, it does not gather, it does not have the thought of possessiveness.  177

(760)
Thus, the non-violent sacrificial cycle of the form, along with the well-established four-fold activity cycle, which was running as a causal cycle, was set in motion. On the straight path of liberation, the 178th Aavachchak Yaga is the initial Yaga, and from it, the two Aavachchak Yagyas are born. These Yagyas are the auspicious cause of the four-fold Yaga, and they are the recipients of the right opportunity Yaga. 17 Those who recognize the form of the saint and serve the saint, receive the saint's fruit and the saint's grace. This is the right opportunity of the three Aavachchak Yagyas, and this is the appropriateness of the four-fold Yaga. 180 This entire four-fold activity cycle, may this treatise be of some benefit to it. By holding onto the right side and the main hearing, and by strengthening the four-fold Yaga. 181 The right side is the action of the feeling of devotion, and it is considered to be as clear as the sun's light. The sun's light is very small and perishable, and in contrast to this, the light of the sun is vast and imperishable! 182 Such a treatise, which is a revealer of secrets, is not suitable for the unworthy. For the unworthy, it will lead to great disrespect. Therefore, the learned Shri Haribhadra, out of compassion, 183 gives it only to the worthy, with love, so that the supreme teachings have their effect in the world. And Shri Haribhadra says that this is the way to avoid obstacles to liberation. This is what Bhagvandas has said in accordance with it. 184

Appendix
The Essence of Icchaya Yoga, Shastra Yoga and Sama Yoga

A truly aspiring soul, a selfless being, on the path to liberation, touches upon three stages: Icchaya Yoga, Shastra Yoga and Sama Yoga, in succession, before attaining liberation. To understand the essence of these stages, let's use a simple analogy.

Imagine a traveler, representing the soul, lost in a terrifying forest, representing the world. First, he desperately wants to escape this forest, to attain liberation. He searches and searches, and finally, he finds a knowledgeable guide, a Sadguru. He learns from the guide and develops faith. Thus, he starts walking on the path of liberation, guided by knowledge and faith. However, he sometimes makes mistakes. This is the stage of Icchaya Yoga, where he progresses on the path of liberation.

During this journey, the guide, representing the scriptures, remains with him. Following the guide's instructions, he gains complete and unwavering knowledge of the scriptures. With the help of the scriptures, he sees the path clearly and progresses with faith, to the best of his ability, without making mistakes.

Eventually, he crosses the terrifying forest and reaches a beautiful highway, a straight path. The destination of liberation appears like a beacon in the distance. Now, the guide, the scriptures, are no longer needed to guide him. He leaves the guide behind, but continues to follow the general instructions. With his own self-power, he progresses with great enthusiasm and speed, this is the stage of Sama Yoga.

With the light of knowledge, he sees the path clearly and overcomes the obstacles, the negative tendencies, with his own self-power. He climbs the ladder of liberation, crossing the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th stages with great speed, and reaches the 13th stage. He attains Keval Jnana, the perfect knowledge, and directly sees the true nature of reality. The city of liberation appears before him. He feels he has reached his destination! He then enjoys the fruits of his knowledge for some time (according to his lifespan) and shares his knowledge with others, benefiting the world. When his lifespan comes to an end, he renounces the body, speech, and mind, and enters the city of liberation through a magnificent door, like a mountain peak, a state of complete detachment. He becomes a Siddha Purusha, a liberated soul, and dwells in eternal bliss, in infinite samadhi, for an infinite period.

## The Essence of the Eight Stages of Consciousness

Friend, Tara, Mala, Diya, Sthira, Kanta, Prabha, Para - these are the eight stages of consciousness, each representing a higher level of self-awareness. They represent increasing levels of light, like a spark, a flame, a fire, etc. 

Page #838:
---------------------------
## The Essence of Eight Yogic Visions (762)

The eight yogic visions can be compared to the light of a straw fire, a village fire, a wooden fire, a lamp, a jewel, a star, the sun, and the moon, respectively. These eight visions correspond to the eight limbs of yoga: Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. They are attained by overcoming the eight types of mental defilements: Khed (sorrow), Udvega (anxiety), Kshepa (agitation), Utthana (excitement), Bhrānti (delusion), Anyamud (confusion), Rugna (illness), and Asanga (attachment). The eight virtues: Advesha (non-attachment), Jijnasa (curiosity), Shushrusha (service), Shravana (listening), Adhyayana (study), Mimamsa (reflection), Pratipatti (understanding), and Pravritti (action) manifest in these eight visions. (For clarity, refer to the accompanying table.)

Here, the word "Dristi" signifies a vision that is aligned with the right faith and the teachings of the scriptures. It leads to the cessation of wrong actions and the manifestation of right actions.

In these eight yogic visions, the first four, starting with Mitra, are characterized by Mithyatva (false belief). Samyaktva (right belief) begins with the fifth vision, called Sthira. Although the first four visions are marked by Mithyatva, they are still considered part of the six visions because they contribute to the attainment of Samyaktva. Just as sugarcane juice and molasses are essential for the production of pure sugar, the stages of Mitra, etc., are crucial for the attainment of pure soul liberation. The vision of Mitra, etc., is like sugarcane, as it yields the sweetness of the nectar of right conduct.

The first four visions, starting with Mitra, are considered to be either "Pratipati" (reversible) or "A-pratipati" (irreversible). However, the last four visions, starting with Sthira, are always irreversible. Once attained, they cannot be lost, and therefore, there is no possibility of suffering in hell, etc. After attaining these irreversible visions, the journey towards liberation becomes continuous and unbroken. If there are any remaining karmic burdens, one may have to take temporary birth as a god or human, but ultimately, one will reach the city of liberation, the "true home."

**Table**

| Yogic Vision | Limb | Defilement | Virtue | Comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mitra | Yama | Khed | Advesha | Straw fire |
| Tara | Niyama | Udvega | Jijnasa | Village fire |
| La | Asana | Kshepa | Shushrusha | Wooden fire |
| Digra | Pranayama | Utthana | Shravana | Lamp |
| Sthira | Pratyahara | Bhrānti | Adhyayana | Jewel |
| Kanta | Dharana | Anyamud | Mimamsa | Star |
| Prabha | Dhyana | Rugna | Pratipatti | Sun |
| Para | Samadhi | Asanga | Pravritti | Moon |

**Note:** Mithyatva (false belief) prevails in the first four visions. Samyaktva (right belief) begins with the fifth vision. 

Page #839:
---------------------------
## The Essence of Citradrusti, Taradrusti, and Aladrusti (763)

**1. The Essence of Mitradrusti**

In this first 'Mitra' Chegadrusti, the vision-intellect illumination is like the light of a blade of grass in fire; the first limb of the vow, Yama, is attained; the first mental defect, called Khed, is abandoned; and the first virtue, called Advesha, manifests.

Here, the seeker, rather than the stationary person, embraces the superior yogic practices, which become the middle-cause of the fruit of the path. The main yogic practices are: (1) pure devotion to the Vitaraga Supreme Being, (2) service-devotion to the soul-liberated, compassionate, and insightful Sadguru, (3) natural detachment from the world, (4) adherence to the principle of non-possession, (5) devotion to the scriptures through study and contemplation, (6) firm belief in the stories of the path and its seeds, and (7) pure feelings of the path's teachings.

The embrace of these superior yogic practices leads to the destruction of many emotional impurities, and through the ripeness of Tathabhavya, it is often found in humans. The main characteristics of the soul in this final stage are: (1) extreme compassion for the suffering, (2) absence of hatred towards the virtuous, and (3) service to all beings with a sense of oneness. Such virtuous and enlightened souls receive the teachings, actions, and guidance of the Sadguru and the righteous. This trio of teachings is truly comparable to the target-action of a mine.

Where all this is attained, in this Mitradrusti, according to the true meaning of the term 'Gunasthan', the first and foremost Gunasthan is present.

**2. The Essence of Taradrusti**

In the second Taradrusti, the vision-intellect illumination is like the embers of dung; the second limb of the vow, Niyama, is attained; the second mental defect, called Udvega, is abandoned; and the second virtue, called Jijnasa, is present.

Here, there are five types of Niyama: Shaucha, Santapa, Tapa, Swadhyaya, and Ishwarpranidhan. Their detailed description is given here.

Furthermore, this group of virtues is also present: (1) supreme love for the stories of the path, (2) respect for those who practice pure truthfulness, and helping them as much as possible, (3) escape from the fear of rebirth, (4) appropriate conduct, and avoidance of inappropriate conduct, (5) curiosity towards those who are more virtuous, (6) regret and fear towards one's own lack of virtue, (7) detachment from the world and a desire to be free from it, (8) wonder at the virtuous actions of the righteous, (9) the feeling of 'what the righteous say is the truth', and the abandonment of self-will.

**3. The Essence of Aladrusti**

In this third Aladrusti, the vision is like a half-burnt piece of wood; the third limb of the vow, Asana, is attained; due to the absence of false desires, there is a state of comfortable sitting everywhere, there is a complete and uninterrupted flow of breath, and there is a commitment to the practice of non-attachment and non-possession. 

Page #840:
---------------------------
(764)
The third virtue attained here, for the Domadashti, is called Shushrusha. This Shushrusha is as intense as the desire of a young, happy man to hear divine music. This Shushrusha is like a stream of nectar, without which, hearing is like a bad medicine in barren land - it is futile, perhaps hearing may not happen, but due to the influence of this Shushrusha, auspicious feelings lead to the fruit of karma-destruction, which is the cause of excellent knowledge. Also, here, the third mental defect called Kshepa is abandoned, meaning there is an accusation related to the senses, and it is the skill of the cowherd. Here, the yogi does not bind the instruments of the Dharma, which are the means of achieving liberation, but always remains free from sin and attains the great, unwavering, compassionate one.

4. For the Deepradashti, the essence is that, as per its name, it has a light of knowledge like a lamp, the fourth limb of the path is Pranayama (Bhavpranayama), the fourth mental defect called Utthana is destroyed, and the fourth virtue called Tav Shravan is attained. However, here, there is still no subtle knowledge. The reason for this is the absence of the Vedhasanvedya-pad, which is pure self-awareness, and the presence of the Adhyasanvedya-pad.

This Adhyasanvedya-pad, which is the characteristic of the Bhava-abhinandi, is like blindness and leads to misery. It is hidden in this very state by the great souls through satsang, agama, and yoga, and it is impossible to reveal it at other times. Even though this Avasanvedya-pad is hidden, the human being's contradictory, illogical arguments are automatically avoided by the law. The seeker is not attached to these evil arguments, which are enemies of the mind in many ways, but is attached to shraddha, shila, samadhi, and pure charity, because the effort of thoughtful beings is for the attainment of the transcendental meaning, and that transcendental meaning is never accessible to dry logic. The knowledge of the omniscient is transcendental, and it is generally understood that there are not many who have a different opinion from the truth, so those who consider it different are deluded by their excessive devotion. Because whatever is called omniscient is truly transcendental, it is one and the same everywhere, despite individual differences. Therefore, what it accepts as common is the same in the minds of all intelligent beings, like many servants of a king. So, the omniscient truth, which is worthy of worship, is not different in its devotees, all the omniscient-believers. Two types of devotion, Chitra and Achitra, are described in the yoga scriptures, which also confirm the unity of the omniscient.

Also, even in the same practice, there are different fruits according to the intention of the seeker, and this intention is also different according to the intensity of attachment, etc., and the difference in the intellect, etc.

---------------------------
## The Essence of the Fifth Insight (765)

There are many types of distinctions in the fifth insight, because there are three types of knowledge: (1) **Buddhi** (intellect), (2) **Jnana** (knowledge), and (3) **Asamaah** (non-attachment). These distinctions arise from the three types of knowledge. 

**Buddhi** is knowledge that relies on the senses, **Jnana** is knowledge that is based on scriptures, and **Asamaah** is knowledge that is free from attachment and is accompanied by right conduct. 

The fruit of **Buddhi** is **Samsara** (cycle of birth and death), the fruit of **Jnana** is **Parapara** (liberation through gradual progress), and the fruit of **Asamaah** is **Shighra Maaks** (swift liberation). 

**Asamaah** is only possible for those who are **Bhavatit** (transcended the cycle of birth and death) and are **Mumukshu** (aspirants for liberation). Those who are **Bhavabhagavirkt** (completely detached from the world) and are **Mumukshu** are only guided by **Sham Parayan** (the path of peace). 

Despite these distinctions, the fifth insight is like a single arrow on the ocean, one and the same. This is because the essence of the fifth insight is **Nirvana** (liberation), which is the same as **Sadashiv Parbrahma Siddhatma** (the supreme consciousness), even though it is known by different names. 

Therefore, the essence of **Nirvana** is one and the same, and there is no dispute about its nature. This essence is **Sajn** (self-aware) and **Sthit** (stable), so how can there be distinctions in **Sajn**? And if there are no distinctions in **Sajn**, then how can there be distinctions in its devotees?

Then, how are there distinctions in the **Sarvagnani** (omniscient) **Deshna** (teachings)? The answer is:

(1) The **Deshna** is like a painting, and its variations are due to the **Shikshya** (disciple's) understanding. 

(2) Or, the **Deshna** is one, but it appears different due to the **Shraata** (listener's) **Machinty** (thought) and **Punyasamarthya** (merit).

(3) Or, the **Deshna** is different due to **Desh** (place), **Kala** (time), etc., and it is transmitted by **Rishi** (sages). The essence of the **Rishi Deshna** is also **Sarvagnani** (omniscient).

Therefore, it is not appropriate to oppose or contradict the **Sarvagnani** without understanding their perspective. It is not appropriate to engage in dry arguments and debates about **Ateeindriya** (supernatural) subjects like **Sarvagnani** with **Chhadmastha** (pretenders). 

For a **Mumukshu**, it is not appropriate to grasp **Sarvatra** (everything) with **Ayuka** (attachment). So, what is the point of grasping **Tuchch** (trivial) and **Shushk** (dry) **Kutarak** (arguments)? 

Therefore, a **Mumukshu** should follow the teachings of these great beings:

(1) Avoid even **Sukhsma Parpiden** (subtle harm).

(2) Always strive for **Papakar** (good deeds).

(3) Worship **Gurudev** (spiritual teacher), **Dwij** (Brahmin), **Yati** (ascetic), etc., appropriately.

(4) Be compassionate towards **Papi Jiwa** (sinful beings).

The essence is that those who are free from the poison of **Aagrah** (attachment) will attain the nectar of **Samyaktva** (right conduct).

## The Essence of the Fifth Insight

In the fifth insight, (1) **Dan** (charity) is like **Ratna Prabha** (jewel light), **Nitya** (eternal) and **Apratipati** (unbreakable). (2) The fifth **Yaganga** (limb of sacrifice), **Pratyahar** (withdrawal of senses), is attained. (3) The fifth **Chitt Dosh** (mental flaw), **Bhrant** (delusion), is eliminated. (4) The fifth **Gun** (quality), **Sukhsma Bel** (subtle strength), is acquired.

Therefore, through the distinction of **Granthi** (knots), the experience of **Shuddhatma** (pure soul) is attained, which is the **Vedya** (object of knowledge) and **Svedya** (subject of knowledge). This removes **Mahatmas** (great darkness) and reveals the dawn of **Bhed Jnana** (knowledge of distinctions). It leads to the understanding of **Swapar Vastu** (self and other), and all external activities appear like **Dhuligruhakrida** (playing in a dust house), **Mrugjal** (mirage), **Swapna** (dream), etc., which are **Asar** (unreal) and **Asthira** (unstable). All external feelings appear like **Mrugjal** and **Swapna**, and only **Atmayati** (self-realization) is considered **Praman** (proof), while everything else is considered **Upplav** (illusion).

The wise, with a discerning vision, always withdraws the senses from objects, never gets attached to the aggregates that are like sin, considers even the aggregates obtained through Dharma as undesirable, and renounces the objects of the senses from afar, worshipping the nectar of the Self. The eight great Siddhis, the nine treasures, and all the powers become the servants of this wise one, coming themselves to offer themselves to the yogi, but this yogi with right vision does not even look at them. Where the infinite radiance of the soul is revealed, what is the use of attainments and Siddhis? Knowing this, the wise yogi with right vision strives only in Dharma, remaining steadfast in his own Dharma.
6. The essence of the sixth right vision is that the vision is like the sun; one attains the sixth Gana called Dharana, abandons the sixth mental defilement called Anyamuda, and attains the sixth virtue called Mimamsa.
Just as the sword is distinct from the scabbard, so too, the yogi with right vision, who knows the Self, knows the soul to be distinct from the body, etc., remains steadfast in the Self, never getting attached to the external world, and through his conduct in accordance with the nature of the Self, he attains perfect purity of conduct. The mind of this great soul, who is the embodiment of Dharma, remains constantly engaged in Dharma, like a faithful wife, while the body is engaged in other activities. This yogi, whose mind is constantly attracted by the knowledge of the Self, does not even get attached to the aggregates! Even amidst the illusory world of Maya, he, who is the Self, remains unstained, like the lotus in water. He who sees the aggregates in their true form, even amidst the ocean of Maya, remains unattached to them and goes towards the supreme state. But he who considers the aggregates as real, that man, who is the servant of the Lord, floats in the ocean of existence. By drinking the nectar of the firm truth of Mimamsa, which says, "I am pure knowledge, everything else is undesirable," this yogi, who is established in this vision, constantly experiences the progress of the Self, which is the rise of benefit.
7. The essence of the seventh right vision is that the light of the seventh right vision is like the sun; here, one attains the seventh Gana called Dhyana, the seventh mental defilement called "Reg" is abandoned, and the seventh virtue called "Tava Pratipatti" is revealed.
Here, the yogi experiences the true bliss of meditation, which is born from the knowledge of the difference between the Self and the non-Self, and is filled with the nectar of peace; because this great wise one, with pure knowledge, constantly meditates on the Self, day and night. Therefore, this yogi experiences the true bliss of meditation on the Self, which is his own, while everything else is suffering and everything else is happiness.

## The Essence of the Raddi

(767) Where there is no attachment to the consequences of actions, where even the dreams of the past are not a shadow, where there is no mental activity even in time, and where there is only the state of pure soul in the self-time, there exists the eternal, unattached activity. This state of pure activity, known as "Asanganushthan," is attained here. This Asanganushthan, which bestows the eternal path, is praised by yogis with many names like Prasantavahitta, Vibhag Parikshay, Shivvatm, Dhruv Bhag. The yogi situated here attains this quickly, therefore this vision, which bestows this state, is dear to the wise.

8. The Essence of the Para-drishti: In the eighth Para-drishti, where there are two lights like the moon, the eighth yoga-anga, Samadhi, is attained. In the eighth, the mental affliction called Asanga is destroyed, and the eighth activity-guna is manifested. Therefore, in this Para-drishti, which is established in Samadhi, where all external influences and mental activities are absorbed, the soul is always established in its pure nature, the mind is always merged in the soul, and the supreme blissful Atma-Samadhi is manifested. In all regions, by the principle of sandalwood fragrance, the self-nature is fully active, and the self-activity in the form of the self is manifested. This supreme yogi, who is established in yoga, is beyond all actions, and is devoid of any form. Therefore, just as there is no need for climbing for one who has already climbed, there is no need for him to follow any actions.

Just as the forest of jewels is created by the arrangement and activity of jewels in this lake, so too, this great sage is created by the arrangement and activity of Dharma-Sannyasa. In other words, this yogi-ishwar, who has attained the yoga of Dharma-Sannyasa, which is the renunciation of all the causes of decay, ascends the series of destructions and attains the eternal, unobstructed, and pure state of Kevalashri. Just as the moon in the sky is situated by its pure nature, and there is no need to establish it, so too, this moon-like pure nature is situated. Its knowledge-veil, like the cloud, is dispelled by the wind of Dharma-Sannyasa, and this great sage attains supreme Keval-jnana and is called "Jnana-kevali." Thus, he whose all faults are completely destroyed, and who is the gatherer of all the fruits of attainment, this true great sage, Srimad Sarvajna, performs supreme selfless service and then attains the end of yoga. In other words, in the state of Shaileshi, he attains the supreme "A-yoga Yoga" and this Lord, who is of the nature of spontaneous birth, destroys the disease of existence and attains supreme blissful Nirvana.

The Essence of Mukta-Tattva-Mimamsa: The man who is free from disease, who is in this lake, is this liberated soul, free from the disease of existence. He is not non-existent, nor is he free from disease, nor is he the one who was previously diseased. Here, the world is the great disease, and birth, death, etc., are its...

(768) The essence of the liberated soul's contemplation, the essence of the conclusion, is the essence of change, which gives rise to a strange kind of attachment and causes intense suffering like attachment, aversion, etc. This karma-born suffering of birth and death is the primary cause, therefore, being liberated from it, the liberated soul also becomes the primary cause, because by getting rid of the defects of birth, death, etc., it attains the state of being free from defects, the state of being free from defects. Therefore, the true nature of the soul, the state of being self-existent, the state of being naturally self-existent, is the state of liberation, the state of being liberated. A patient, or his lack, or another who liberates him from the disease, does not diminish the patient's primary nature; similarly, a being born into the cycle of birth and death, or his lack, or another who liberates him from it, does not diminish the primary nature of the being born into the cycle of birth and death. But just as a man who has been cured of a disease is in a state of being free from disease in the lake; similarly, the soul which has been cured of the disease of birth, the being born into the cycle of birth and death, is said to be free from the disease of birth in the scriptures. The absence of disease does not make the patient disappear, but it is the state of being healthy, the state of being free from disease, that is the state of being healthy; similarly, the absence of the disease of birth does not make the soul disappear, but it is the state of being free from the disease of birth, the state of being the true nature of the soul, the state of being a healthy soul, that is the state of being naturally self-existent, and that is the state of liberation. The essence of the conclusion, the churning of the great ocean of yoga scriptures, has been taken by the sage Shri Haribhadrasuri, the seer of yoga, in the form of the book "Yoga Drishti Samuccaya"; each of its sutras is as if a full ocean of knowledge is contained in a single drop, it is full of profound meaning, for the purpose of guiding it, Bhagvandas has written a long commentary on this book with great enthusiasm, and in it, with even greater enthusiasm, he has created this new work of poetry, which shows the essence of the book and the commentary. This yoga scripture will be beneficial to all those who are seekers of liberation, who are free from the cycle of birth and death and who are engaged in the cycle of birth and death. The characteristics of those who are free from the cycle of birth and death and those who are engaged in the cycle of birth and death have been clearly described here. Those who recognize the true nature of the saints and serve them, they receive the blessings of the saints, the fruits of the saints - such are the three types of seekers, those who are attracted by the greatness, those who are attracted by the knowledge, and those who are attracted by the fruits, they are the ones who are worthy of this scripture in this age, and they are the ones who are worthy of this scripture. The difference between pure feeling and feelingless action is like the difference between the sun and the moon, etc., the secrets that this scripture reveals, it does not give to the ignorant, but it gives to the wise with great love, so that there may be a great impact on the world and the seekers of liberation may be freed from suffering.
