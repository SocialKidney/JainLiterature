## Agam Sutra 31, Payanna Sutra-8, 'Gani Vidya'
[31] Gani Vidya Payanna Sutra-8-Hindi Translation
Sutra-1
I will speak of the excellent Nav Bal method, as it is shown in the Pravachan Shastra, as it is spoken by the Jinas, and as it is praised by the learned. Sutra-2
This excellent Nav Bal method is as follows: day, tithi, nakshatra, karan, graha din, muhurta, shukan bal, lagna bal, nimitta bal. Sutra-3
In both halves of the day, hora is strong, in the night it is weak, in the night it is the opposite, recognize that bala bal method. Sutra-4-7
Ekam has no benefit, bij has calamity, trij has wealth fulfillment, pancham has victory and remains ahead. Satam has many virtues, dasham has a smooth path if you depart. Know that ekadashi has no obstacles in health and well-being. Those who have become enemies are in the family after terah. Avoid fourteenth, full moon, eighth, ninth, sixth, fourth, and twelfth in both halves of the day. Sutra-8
Shiksha should be given on ekam, pancham, dasham, full moon, and ekadashi. Sutra-9-10
There are five tithis: Nanda, Bhadra, Vijaya, Tushka, and Purna. These occur once each in a month, six times. Give shiksha on Nanda, Jaya, and Purna tithi. Observe fast on Nanda Bhadra and abstain from food on Purna. Sutra-11-14
Pursya, Ashwini, Magha, Revati, Hasta, Chitra, Anuradha, Jyestha, and Mula, these nine nakshatras are auspicious for travel. Mrigashirsha, Magha, Mula, Visakha, Anuradha Hasta, Uttara, Revati, Ashwini, and Shravana, depart and stay in these nakshatras, but there should not be an eclipse or twilight during this time. (Those who travel in this way) always receive food and drink, many fruits and flowers on the way, and also find peace and well-being on their journey. Sutra-15
Avoid all nakshatras that are Sandhyagat, Ravigat, Vidder, Sangrah, Vilambi, Rahugat, and Grahabhinna. (Explaining further, it is said that). Sutra-16
The nakshatra at the time of sunset is Sandhyagat, the nakshatra in which the sun is present is Ravigat, the nakshatra that is reversed is Vidder, the nakshatra in which a cruel planet is present is Sangrah. Sutra-17
The nakshatra that the sun has left is Vilambi, the nakshatra in which there is an eclipse is Rahugat, the nakshatra in which a planet is spread in the middle is called Grahabhinna.

---------------------------
Agam Sutra 31, Payannasutra-8, 'Ganividya' Sutra - 18-20
There is disagreement in the Sandhyagat Nakshatra and dispute in the Vilambi Nakshatra. In the Vidder, the one in front wins and in the Adityagat, supreme sorrow is obtained. In the Sangrah Nakshatra, there is suppression, in the Rahugat, death, and in the Grahabhinn, there is vomiting of blood. Sandhyagat, Rahugat and Adityagat Nakshatras are weak and rough. Know the remaining Nakshatras, free from the Sandhyadi four and the Grahanakshatra, as strong. Sutra-21-28
To approach plants in Pushya, Hasta, Abhijit, Ashwini and Bharani Nakshatras. Do not perform Nishkraman (initiation) in Shravana, Ghanishtha and Punarvasu, and should start learning in Shatabhisha, Pushya, Hasta Nakshatras. Mrigashirsha, Ardra, Pushya, three Purva, Mula, Ashlesha, Hasta, Chitra, these ten are the Nakshatras that increase knowledge. Hasta etc. five are auspicious for clothes. To perform Lochkarma in Punarvasu, Pushya, Shravana and Ghanishtha, these four Nakshatras. In the three Uttara and Rohini, the newly initiated should be given Nishkraman (initiation), Upasthapana (major initiation) and permission from the Gani or Vachan. To collect the Gan, establish the Gandhar. To make Avgrah Vasati, to make stability in the place. Sutra - 29, 30
Pushya, Hasta, Abhijit, Ashwini, these four Nakshatras are beautiful and capable for starting work. (What works they tell). ..... To acquire knowledge, to practice Brahmayog, to study, to get permission, to have a purpose and a goal. Sutra - 31-32
Anuradha, Revati, Chitra and Mrigashirsha, these four are soft Nakshatras, in which soft work should be done. One suffering from begging should take on the vow. For children and old people, one should do Sangrah-Upgrah. Sutra - 33-34
Ardra, Ashlesha, Jyestha and Mula, these four Nakshatras are for Guru pratima and Tapkarma. To bear the affliction of Devas, humans and animals, to strengthen the Mulaguna-Uttaraguna. Sutra - 35-36
Madha, Bharani, three Purva are fierce Nakshatras. In them, one should do external and internal penance. There are 360 penance practices. In the combination of fierce Nakshatras, one should do other penances. Sutra - 37-38
Krittika and Vishakha, these two are hot Nakshatras, in them, one should do smearing and sewing and Santhara-equipment, vessels etc., disputes, Avgrah and clothes (wearing) should be done by the Acharya. Sutra- 39-41
Ghanishtha, Shatabhisha, Swati, Shravana and Punarvasu, in these Nakshatras, one should do Guru seva, Chaitya puja, study, acquire knowledge and renunciation, perform vows, and get permission from the Gani and Vachan. To collect the Gan, initiate the disciple, to collect etc. by the Ganavcchedak. Sutra -42-43
Bav, Balav, Kolav, Strilochan, Gar - etc., Vanij Visti, are the Nishadhi Karana of the Shukla Paksha; Shakuni, Chatushpad, Nag, Kinstughna are Dhruva Karana. On the night of Krishna Chaturdashi, Shakuni Karana occurs. Sutra-44
By doubling the Tithi and not counting the dark night, dividing by seven, the remainder is the Karana. (In general practice, two Karana are mentioned for one Tithi.)

Agam Sutra 31, Payannasutra-8, 'Ganividya' Sutra - 72
Causes are not destroyed. What is spoken by the Rishis is not false, conduct is destroyed by the cause of bad sight. Conduct is not destroyed by the cause of good sight. Sutra - 73-79
There is no transgression in the speech of the one who is born, and the child who speaks, and then the woman who speaks - by that birth and of that birth and by it, similarly, there is instruction from the similar to the similar, from the similar to the similar. To initiate disciples in the cause of men and women. To abandon all actions in the cause of eunuchs, to abandon all beginnings in the cause of mixed, the cause is not artificial. Causes indicate the future. By which the Siddha Purusha knows the characteristics of the origin of the cause. To initiate disciples, establish vows, gather the community, and establish the Ganadhara in a good, strong, and powerful cause. One should seek the permission of the Shruta Skandha and the Ganivachaka. Sutra - 80-81
To abandon all actions and practice self-realization in an unsuitable, weak, and loose cause. To begin a good action always in a good cause, to abandon all actions in an unsuitable cause. Sutra - 82-84
The tithi is stronger than the day. The nakshatra is stronger than the tithi. The karana is stronger than the nakshatra, the graha-dina is stronger than the karana. The muhurta is stronger than that, the shakun is stronger than the muhurta. The lagna is stronger than the shakun. The cause is the most important. The strength of the cause is superior to the isolated cause. The cause is the most important. There is nothing stronger than the cause in the world. Sutra - 85
Thus, the method of strength and weakness has been spoken by the well-wisher in brief. Which is the knowledge that is to be grasped by the Anuyoga. And one should know it with diligence.
