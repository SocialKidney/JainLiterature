Bhavana Acharya Samantabhadra divided the Jain Agamas into four parts: Pratimanuyoga, Charananuyoga, Karananuyoga, and Dravyanuyoga. Of these, Karananuyoga is the most complex and not easily understood by everyone. Motivated by compassion, the learned, elderly, and experienced scholar Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya wrote the first part of Karananuyoga Deepak based on the Jivakanda, the second part based on the Karmakanda, and the third part based on Triloksar, Tiloypannatti, and Rajavartika. These were published by the Shri Bharatvarshiya Di. Jain Mahasabha in 1685, 1687, and 1960 respectively. The copies of the first part have been exhausted. Last year, there was a need in the Sangha, which was fulfilled by making Xerox copies. Therefore, a plan was made to publish its second edition.
Aryika Prasantamatiji, a member of the Sangha, prepared the press copy by making some corrections based on the Jivakanda and adding some questions and answers. It is our hope that she will continue to work in this way and increase her available क्षयोपशम.
Panditji Sa. has explained very difficult concepts in a concise

And the simple and accessible literature that you have given to today's pleasure-seeking human mind is highly praiseworthy. Even in your old age, you remain constantly engaged in the service of Mother Saraswati, this is exemplary for every self-interested person. My feeling was that Pandit Ji would progress further in character, but due to physical circumstances, it could not happen. Now, may your use be engaged in the service of Jinvani until the end, this is my heartfelt wish. _ For the purpose of study, Br. Bhavana had the Xerox copies of this book made. Therefore, the results of their efforts have led to its publication. May their results in the service of Saraswati continue in this way, this is my blessing.

## Introduction

The complexity of Karanaanuyoag in Jain literature is well-known. Access for the average reader to authentic texts is practically impossible. Without a proper understanding of Gunasthan, Margana and Jivasamaas, it is impossible to move forward in this direction. Therefore, it is possible to present these profound topics in a simple and understandable manner (Madc Easy). While work has been done in this direction, its usefulness cannot be denied. 

The books written by Pandit Kailashchandra Shastri in the question-and-answer style on Karanaanuyoag, Dravyanuyoag and Charanaanuyoag were published by the Chira Seva Mandir Trust, Varanasi, but are now unavailable. A version of 'Dravyanuyoag Pradeshka' written by Pandit Pannalalji was published from Shantivirnagar, but it is also unavailable now. Before these, Guru of Gurus, Shri Gopaladasji Bareya, had written 'Jain Siddhant Praveshika' in the question-and-answer style, which was a very useful publication, but it is also not easily available today.

Understanding the importance of publishing books in this style, the Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Mahasabha took a step in this direction, resulting in the publication of Karanaanuyoag Deepak parts 1, 2, and 3 in 1985, 1987, and 1990 respectively. The author of these three books is Pandit Pannalalji Jain Sahityacharya, a renowned scholar of the Jain world. He is continuously...

They are engaged in study and teaching. Every *swadhyayee* is well acquainted with their numerous translated and original works. Recently, they have done a new edition and translation of Acharya Viranandi's 'Acharsar' by taking textual variations from ancient manuscripts, this edition will be available soon.
This publication is the new revised and edited second edition of *Karananuyog Deepak* Part One. The first edition had 166 questions and answers, this edition has 262. The effort of editing and preparing the press copy for this edition has been done by the venerable *Aryika* 105 Shri Prashantamati Mataji.
Br. Bhavana has provided financial assistance for its publication. _ I express my heartfelt gratitude to the venerable *Aryika* Prashantamatiji, the esteemed Pandit Pannalalji and Br. Mavna sister and the publication department of the Mahasabha for this useful publication and I offer my humble salutations at the feet of the inspiring source of *Shruta-sadhana*, the venerable *Aryika* Vishuddhamati Mataji, whose blessings enable me to serve the *Jinvani* Mata in whatever small way. I humbly apologize for any errors in the publication.

Karananuyog Deepak
Aksham Mana
1. Question: What is Karananuyog? Answer: It is the description of Gunasthan, Margana, and the emotions of the Jiva, as well as the Lok-Alok and the Kalchakra, etc. 2. Question: What is Gunasthan? Answer: The gradation of the self-transformations that occur due to Moha and Yoga is called Gunasthan. 3. Question: How many types of Gunasthan are there? Answer: There are fourteen types of Gunasthan: 1. Mithyatva, 2. Sasadan, 3. Misra, 4. Avirat Samyaktva, 5. Deshavirat, 6. Pramattavist, 7. Apramattavirat, 8. Apurvakaran, 

Page #7:
---------------------------
6. Anivrittikaran, 10. Sukshma Sampray, 11. Upashantamoha,
12. Kshina-moha, 13. Sayogkevali and 14 Ayogkevali. _ 4. Question: What is Mithyatva Gunasthan? Answer: The results of the lack of faith in the true nature of reality, which arise from the Mithyatva nature, are called Mithyatva Gunasthan.
Those beings who are endowed with these results are called Mithyadrishti. 5. Question: How many types of Mithyadrishti are there? Answer: There are two types of Mithyadrishti - 1. Svasthan Mithyadrishti and
2. Satishya Mithyadrishti. The being who is immersed in Mithyatva is called Svasthan Mithyadrishti. The being who is endowed with the results of Adhokarana, Apurvakarana and Anivrittikaran, which are in front of the attainment of Samyagdarshan, is called Satishya Mithyadrishti. 6. Question: What is Sasadan Gunasthan? Answer: When only the time of Antarmuhurt remains in the first or second Upashma Samyaktva, and when the time of the lowest one Samaya and the highest six Avali remains, then in that time, from the infinite Anubandhi Krodha-Mana-Maya-Lobha, any one of them 
(2)

---------------------------
The state of **Sāsādan Guṇasthān** is the latent, non-essential belief (**atattva-śraddhā**), which is the result of the **samyaktva** (right faith, right knowledge, right conduct) being contradicted by the arising of **anantānubandhī** (infinitely connected) **kaṣāya** (passions). 

Or, in other words, **Sāsādan Guṇasthān** is the state that arises in the middle period when the **samyaktva** results are lost due to the arising of any one of the **anantānubandhī** **kaṣāya**, and the **mithyātva** (false faith, false knowledge, false conduct) results are not present due to the non-arising of **mithyātva** nature.

**Question:** If the arising of **anantānubandhī** destroys **samyaktva**, then it should be counted among the types of **darśanamohaniya** (that which obscures right faith). If it is a type of **cāritramohaniya** (that which obscures right conduct), then it cannot contradict **samyaktva**. In such a situation, how can **Sāsādan Guṇasthān** exist?

**Answer:** The **anantānubandhī** **kaṣāya** is a type of **cāritramohaniya**, but it has the nature of destroying both **samyagdarsan** (right faith) and **samyakcāritra** (right conduct). In other words, **anantānubandhī** **kaṣāya** has a dual nature. This **kaṣāya** destroys **samyaktva** and maintains the infinite flow of **apratyākyānāvaraṇa** (non-rejectable covering) and other **kaṣāya**. Thus, **anantānubandhī**... 

Page #9:
---------------------------
The duality of *kṣaya* being established, the *sāsādana* *guṇasthāna* is separately established.
8.
Question: What is a mixed *guṇasthāna*?
Answer: Where, due to the arising of the nature of *jātyantara* *sarvaghāti* *samyagmithyātvaprakṛti*, the result is not only in the form of *samyaktva* or *mithyātvaprakṛti*, but in a mixed form, it is called a mixed *guṇasthāna*.
6.
Just as the taste of mixed curd and jaggery is neither sour nor sweet, but sour-sweet, in the same way, in the same time, the result of this *guṇasthāna*-dwelling being is obtained in the form of *samyaktva* in relation to the well-known *tattvashraddhā* and in the form of *mithyātvaprakṛti* in relation to the *atattvashraddhā* known as *sarvajñābhās*!
Question: What are the characteristics of a being dwelling in a mixed *guṇasthāna*?
Answer: A being dwelling in a mixed *guṇasthāna* does not accept *sakalasamyama* or *deśasamyama*. In this *guṇasthāna*, there is no new *āyu* bondage, no *māraṇāntika* *samuddhāt*, and no death.

---------------------------
10. Question: What is Avirat Samyaktv Gunasthan? Answer: Where Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktv nature and the seven natures of Anantanu bandhi Krodh, Man, Maya and Lobh, are subsided, destroyed or subsided and destroyed, resulting in Samyagdarshan, but the four natures of A-pratyakhyana Avarana, etc., of Charitramoh remain, resulting in no outcome of the abandonment of the five sins, it is called Avirat Samyaktv. The being in this Gunasthan is not detached from the objects of the senses and the violence of Tras and Sthavar beings, but due to the manifestation of the qualities of Prasham, Sanveg, Anukampa and Astikya in the inner being, he does not engage in sinful acts like injustice, violence, etc., and does not enjoy worldly pleasures with attachment. 11. Question: What is the special characteristic of Shraddhan in the fourth Gunasthan? Answer: The Samyagdristi being has faith in the teachings given by the Acharyas, but due to his own ignorance, he also has faith in the opposite meaning of the Guru's teachings, even then he is a Samyagdristi.

## Sutra

By the support of the Sutra, by showing the Agamas through the Acharya etc., even if the explanation of the appropriate matter does not break the **jiva** in any way, then from that time onwards, the **jiva** is called **Mithyadristi** due to the **Ajnana** (ignorance) committed by it.

**12.**

**Question:** What is **Deshaviraat Gunasthan**?

**Answer:** Where, due to the arising of **Apratyaakhyanavaran Kshaya**, there are results in this **jiva** in the form of the abandonment of one part of the five sins like **Himsa** (violence) etc., it is called **Deshaviraat Gunasthan**. In this **Gunasthan**, there is a **viraat** (detached) feeling with respect to **ahimsa** (non-violence) and an **aviraat** (attached) feeling with respect to the abandonment of **sthavar himsa** (violence towards stationary beings), therefore this **Gunasthan** is also called **viraataviraat** or **sanyamasanyam**.

**13.**

**Question:** What is **Pramattaviraat Gunasthan**?

**Answer:** Where, due to the arising of **Pratyaakhyanavaran Kshaya**, complete **sanyam** (self-control) has been achieved, but due to the remaining arising of **sanjwalan** (agitation) and **nokshaaya** (attachment), there is a result in the form of **pramada** (negligence) which produces impurities in **sanyam**, therefore this **Gunasthan** is called **Pramattaviraat Gunasthan**.

**(6)**

।
14. Question: What is the Aprammattavirata Gunasthan? Answer: When the Sanjwalana and Nokashaya have a mild rise, then the absence of the Pramāda-rupa parināmas of the Muni who is endowed with Sakalasanyama, is called Aprammattavirata Gunasthan. 15. Question: How many types of Aprammattavirata Gunasthan are there? Answer: There are two types of Aprammattavirata Gunasthan: 1. Sammana Aprammattavirata and 2. Sātishaya Aprammattavirata. Those who keep going up and down from the seventh Gunasthan to the sixth and from the sixth Gunasthan to the seventh are called Svasthan Aprammattavirata. Those who, being in front of the Upshama or Kshapaka श्रेणी, perform the Adhapravṛttakarana-rupa parināmas are called Sātishaya Aprammattavirata. 16. Question: What is Adhapravṛttakarana? Answer: Where the parināmas of the Sama-samayavarti jivas are both equal and unequal to the parināmas of the Bhinna-samayavarti jivas, it is called Adhapravṛttakarana. These Adhapravṛttakarana 

Page #13:
---------------------------
The second name for the *apramattavirata* *gunasthan* is also *adhahkaran*. Here, the *anukrishti-rachana* is present, which shows attraction in the upper and lower results. 7. Question: What is the *purvaha* *gunasthan*? Answer: Where the results of the contemporary beings are both similar and dissimilar, and the results of the non-contemporary beings are only dissimilar, it is called the *apurvakaran* *gunasthan*. In this *gunasthan*, *anukrishti-rachana* is not present. 18. Question: What is *anukrishti-rachana*? Answer: The creation that shows attraction, i.e., similarity, in the upper and lower results is called *anukrishti-rachana*. 16. Question: What are the necessary functions performed by the *apurvakaran* results? Answer: There are four necessary functions performed by the *apurvakaran* results: (1) *gunashreni nirjara* (2) *gunasanakraman* (3) *sthikhandan* 

Page #14:
---------------------------
And (4) Section-Khandan. All these four actions take place in the pre-determined Kones. These results are eager to destroy or alleviate the 21 natures of Mohaniya Karma in the garden of results. 20. Question: What is Gunashreni Nirjara?
Answer: The falling (destruction) of Karma-Paramanus in successive times in a multiplied form is Gunashreni Nirjara. For example, if 10 Karma-Paramanus arise in the first time of a being, then in the second time, 10 times innumerable Paramanus arise. In the third time, 10 times innumerable times innumerable Paramanus arise. In the fourth time, innumerable times more Paramanus arise than in the third time. In this way, the continuous arising of innumerable times innumerable Karma Paramanus is Gunashreni Nirjara. Suppose that innumerable is 2 and the Paramanus arising in the first time are 10, then the number of Paramanus arising in the first, second, third, etc. times will be: 10, 20, 

Page #15:
---------------------------
40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, this is the **guna-shreni nirjara**. In **guna-shreni nirjara**, the juice of inauspicious karmas also becomes weak and arises. **Guna-shreni nirjara** is of both auspicious and inauspicious karmas. In the fourth **guna-sthana**, there is no continuous **guna-shreni nirjara** (My Pro. Ma. - 341, 361 Sasti Granthamala). Only when there is **samyama** (vrat) is there continuous **guna-shreni nirjara** (Dhavala - 8/83). Therefore, from the fifth **guna-sthana**, there is continuous **guna-shreni nirjara** (J.D. 12). 21. Question: What is **guna-samkramana**? Answer: Where, due to countless **guna-shreni-krama**, the **paramanu-pradesha** transforms into another **prakriti** form, it is called **guna-samkramana**. 22. Question: What is **sthiti-khandana** (**sthiti-kandaka-ghat**)? Answer: Scratching and destroying the upper part, sections, or layers of the state of karmas is called **sthiti-khandana** or **sthiti-kandaka-ghat**. By **sthiti-kandaka-ghat**, the **sthiti-sattva** of karmas decreases. (10) 

Page #16:
---------------------------
23. Question: What is **Anubhag-Khandan** (**Anubhag-Kandak-Ghat**)?
Answer: Scratching and destroying the upper part, section, or layers of the **Anubhag** of karmas is called **Anubhag-Khandan** or **Anubhag-Kandak-Ghat**. Through **Anubhag-Kandak-Ghat**, the **Anubhag-Satva** of karmas decreases. 24. Question: What is **Anivrittikaran Gunasthan**?
Answer: Just as there is a difference among various contemporary beings in terms of external factors like the body's **Avgahana** etc. and internal factors like **Jnana-Avarana** etc. karmas due to their destruction and pacification, similarly, there is no difference in the **Parinamas** of various contemporary beings (in terms of purity), but there is a complete difference in the **Parinamas** of beings from different times. This is called **Anivrittikaran Gunasthan**.
The time for these three causes decreases progressively, and the number of **Parinamas** increases progressively.
(11) 

Page #17:
---------------------------
25. Question: What is the subtle Saṃpārāya Guṇasthāna?
Answer: Just as a subtle redness remains in a washed kusuma cloth, in the same way, where the twenty types of karmas that are conducive to attachment are subdued or destroyed, and the subtle Kṛṣṭi is attained, the subtle Sanjvalana Lobha Kaṣāya arises. This is called the subtle Saṃpārāya Guṇasthāna. In this Guṇasthāna, there is slightly less Charitra than the known Charitra.

26. Question: How is subtle Kṛṣṭi attained?
Answer: Those that are found before the cessation of competition are called Pūryasparadhaka. Those whose portion becomes infinitely diminished due to the result of cessation of competition are called Apūrvāspardhaka. Those whose portion becomes infinitely diminished than the Apūrvāspardhaka are called Bādarkṛṣṭi. Those whose portion becomes infinitely diminished than the Bādarkṛṣṭi are called Sūkṣmakṛṣṭi. All these actions take place in the ninth Guṇasthāna. 

Page #18:
---------------------------
27. Question: What are Avibhaga-pratichheda, Samayabaddha, Varga, Vargana and Sparadhaka? Answer: The power of karmas to bear fruit is called Anubhaga and the smallest part of that power is called Avibhaga-pratichheda. The group of all the atoms of karma or nokarma that bind at every moment in the state of Samsara is called Samayabaddha. The atom in which the smallest part of the power of Anubhaga, i.e. Avibhaga-pratichheda, is found in the desired Samayabaddha is called Harga. The group of all the Vargas in which the same number of Avibhaga-pratichhedas are found is called Vargana. The group of Varganas in which the same increase in Avibhaga-pratichhedas is found is called Sparadhaka. 28. Question: What is the Upshanta-moha Gunasthan? Answer: Like the water of a pond filled with pure fruit or like the water of a lake that becomes clear from the top in the autumn season, the state of mind that arises from the complete cessation of all mohaniya karma is called Upshanta-moha Gunasthan. 

Page #19:
---------------------------
The **Nirmala** (pure) results are called **Nasaloh Gunasthan**. The living being who possesses this **Gunasthan** falls down to the lower **Gunasthan** due to the destruction of **Ayukṣaya** (lifespan) or the time of the **Gunasthan** within a moment. 26. Question: What is **Kṣīṇamoha Gunasthan**? Answer: Where the **Mohaniya** (delusive) karma is completely destroyed and the results of the soul are as pure as water kept in a clear crystal vessel, it is called **Kṣīṇamoha Gunasthan**. 30. Question: What is **Sayogakevali Gunasthan**? Answer: Where the **Ghātiya** (destructive) karma of 47, **Nāmakarma** (name karma) of 13, and **Ayukarma** (lifespan karma) of 3, thus 63 types of karma are destroyed, and **Kevalgyan** (omniscience) is attained along with **Yoga** (spiritual practice), it is called **Sayogakevali Gunasthan**. In this **Gunasthan**, the soul is endowed with **Ananta Chatuṣṭaya** (four infinite qualities) and **Nava Kevalalabdhi** (nine omniscient attainments). Due to the destruction of **Ghātikarma**, they are called **Jin**, **Jinendra**, or **Arihant**. The **Tīrthankara** **Arihant** creates a **Samavasarana** (assembly hall). (14) 

Page #20:
---------------------------
31. Question: What is the Aयोगकेवली गुणस्थान? Answer: Where there is complete absence of the three yogas - मन (mind), बचन (speech), and काय (body) - it is called Aयोगकेवली गुणस्थान. The duration of this गुणस्थान is equal to the time taken to pronounce the five short vowels - 'अ इ उ ऋ तृ'. In the penultimate moment, 72 प्रकृतियों are destroyed, and in the final moment, 13 प्रकृतियों are destroyed. Upon liberation from karma-bandha, the soul's प्रदेशes reach the सिद्धालय in a single moment through ऋजुगति. 32. Question: Where is the सिद्धालय? Answer: At the end of the लोक, in the last 525 धनुष-प्रमाण क्षेत्र of the तनुवातवलय, lies the सिद्धालय, i.e., the abode of the सिद्ध परमेष्ठी. The प्रदेशes of the सिद्धात्मा, due to their upward-moving nature, although ascend, but due to the absence of further धर्मास्तिकाय, they remain in the लोकान्त. 33. Question: Which भाय are found in each गुणस्थान in relation to मोहनीय कर्म? Answer: In relation to दर्शनमोहनीय कर्म, in the first गुणस्थान, औदयिक... 

Page #21:
---------------------------
In the second *guna sthana*, there are *parinaamik* emotions. In the third *guna sthana*, there are *kshayopshaamik* emotions. In the fourth *guna sthana*, all three emotions, *aupshamik*, *kshayik*, and *kshayopshaamik*, are found.

With respect to *darshanamohaniya karma*, *aupshamik*, *kshayik*, and *kshayopshaamik* emotions are found in all three *guna sthana*s: *deshvirat*, *pramatvirat*, and *apramatvirat*. With respect to *charitramohaniya karma*, only *kshayopshaamik* emotions are found in these three *guna sthana*s.

With respect to *darshanamohaniya karma*, *aupshamik* and *kshayik* emotions are found in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh *guna sthana*s of the *upsham* category. With respect to *charitramohaniya karma*, only *aupshamik* emotions are found in these four *guna sthana*s.

With respect to both *darshanamohaniya karma* and *charitramohaniya karma*, only one *kshayik* emotion is found in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth *guna sthana*s of the *kshapik* category.

In *sayogkevali*, *ayogkevali*, and *gunasthanatit* *siddhas*, one *kshayik* emotion is also found as a rule.
(16) 

Page #22:
---------------------------
34. Question: In what order does the soul ascend and descend through the Gunasthanas?
Answer: Mithyadrishti is the nature of the Gunasthana. The Anadi Mithyadrishti soul, due to the influence of Karnalabdhi, goes to the fourth Gunasthana through the subsidence of the Samyaktvaghatak (destructive of right faith) natures. The Sadi Mithyadrishti soul goes to the fourth Gunasthana through the rise of the Samyaktvaprakriti (nature of right faith). The Sadi Mithyadrishti soul goes to the third Gunasthana through the rise of the Samyagmithyatva (mixed right and wrong faith) nature. The Sadi Mithyadrishti soul goes to the Deshaviraat Gunasthana through the result of the partial abandonment of Samyaktv and the five sins.
The Sadi Mithyadrishti soul goes to the Aprammattaviraat Gunasthana through the result of the four-fold nature of the Charitra (conduct) arising from the rise of Samyaktv and the Pratyakhyanavaran Chatushk (fourfold veil of negation). From this statement, it is evident that the Mithyadrishti soul can attain the four Gunasthanas up to Aprammattaviraat, excluding Sasadan and Prammattaviraat.

Those who attain the first *gunasthana* (stage of spiritual progress) are freed from *ko* (attachment) and *mithyatva* (false belief).  Those who attain the fifth *gunasthana* are freed from the four *pratyakhyana-avaran* (veils of knowledge) and attain the seventh *gunasthana*. They can also attain the four lower *gunasthanas*. Those who attain the sixth *gunasthana* can attain the five lower *gunasthanas* but can only progress up to the *aprammatta-virata* *gunasthana* (the stage of perfect non-attachment), not beyond. Those who attain the seventh *gunasthana* are freed from *apuurva-karana* (the cause of rebirth), the sixth *gunasthana*, and attain the fourth *gunasthana* (the stage of heavenly existence) in relation to death (thus, three *gunasthanas*). Those who attain the eighth, ninth, and tenth *gunasthanas* in the *upshama* (subduing) category, can attain higher *gunasthanas* in relation to ascending, lower *gunasthanas* in relation to falling, and the fourth *gunasthana* in relation to death. Those who attain the eleventh *gunasthana* can attain the tenth *gunasthana* in relation to falling and the fourth *gunasthana* in relation to death. Those who attain the eighth and ninth *gunasthanas* in the *kshapika* (destroying) category... 

Page #25:
---------------------------
Instead of ascending, they attain the higher Gunasthanas. The tenth Gunasthanas, belonging to the Kshapaka category, attain the twelfth Gunasthanas by rule, and from there, they attain the subsequent Gunasthanas in order, ultimately achieving Moksha. 35. Question: What is the Upshama category, and which beings attain it? Answer: The category that is traversed to subdue Charitramoha is called the Upshama category. Both the Dvitiyopshama Samyagdarshi and the Kshayika Samyagdarshi can traverse this category. The category begins with the Adhokarana results. Beings in this category attain the Adhokarana, Apurvakarana, Anivrittikarana, and Sukhma-Sampsaya Gunasthanas, at least, and at the end of Sukhma-Samparaya, they completely subdue Charitramoha and then attain the eleventh Upshanta Moha Gunasthanas. From there, they descend in order. The Dvitiyopshama Samyagdarshi beings fall from the eleventh Gunasthanas (20) 

Page #26:
---------------------------

Each of these has three subcategories based on their habitat: **jalachara** (aquatic), **thalachara** (terrestrial), and **nabhachara** (aerial), resulting in a total of six categories. These six types of beings are further divided into two categories based on their birth: **garbhajanma** (born from a womb) and **sammūrchana janma** (born from a sprout). 

The six types of beings born from a womb are further divided into two categories based on their **paryāpta** (capacity): **paryāpta** and **nityaparyāpta**, resulting in (6 x 2) = 12 categories. The six types of beings born from a sprout are further divided into three categories based on their **paryāpta**: **paryāpta**, **nirvṛtyaparyāpta**, and **labdhyaparyāpta**, resulting in (6 x 3) = 18 categories. Thus, there are a total of (12 + 18) = 30 categories of **karmabhūmija** **tiryach**.

**Bhogabhūmija** **tiryach** with five senses are divided into two categories based on their habitat: **thalachara** and **nabhachara**. Each of these is further divided into two categories based on their **paryāpta**: **paryāpta** and **nityaparyāpta**, resulting in (2 x 2) = 4 categories.

The substance that is the subject of Samyak-gyan is called Satya, for example, "This is water." The substance that is the subject of Mithya-gyan is called Asatya, for example, calling a mirage "water." The substance that is the subject of both is called Ubhaya, for example, a "Kamandalu" (a water pot). 

Page #70:
---------------------------
"Ghat" is said because the Kamandalu serves the purpose of a "Ghat," therefore it is partially true and not "Ghatakar," therefore it is partially false. The substance which is not the subject of both knowledge is called "Anubhay," like the general appearance that "this is something." Here, there can be no decision of truth or falsehood, therefore it is "Anubhay." 135. Question: How many types of "Anubhayavachan" are there? Answer: There are nine types of "Anubhayavachan" - (1) "Aamantrani" - O Devadatta! Come here, (2) "Aagnapani" - Do this work, (3) "Yachaniya" - Give me this, (4) "Aachhani" - What is this? (5) "Prajnapani" - What should I do, such informational sentences, (6) "Pratyakhyani" - I leave this, (7) "Sanshayavachani" - Is this a "Balaka" or a "Pataka," (8) "Ichchhanuloomni" - I should also be like this, such sentences expressing desire, (9) "Anksharatmak" - The language of the five-sense beings, including the "Indriya" and the "Asanji," is "Anksharatmak." These nine types of sentences, when heard, give knowledge of both the manifest and the unmanifest parts, because they cannot be called false due to the manifestation of the general part, and they cannot be called true due to the non-manifestation of the specific part. 

Page #71:
---------------------------
They cannot be called truth because of their existence, therefore they are called **Anubhay Vachan**.
136. Question: What are Vedas? How many types are there and what is their nature?

There are also three types of Vedas
(1) **Purushaved** (2) **Strived** and (3) **Napunsakaved**. **Napunsakaved** is present in hell beings, **Strived** and **Purushaved** in gods and all three Vedas are present in the remaining beings. There is similarity in **Dravyaved** and **Bhavaved** in gods and hell beings, but there is also some disparity in humans and animals of the **Karmabhoomi**.

That is to say, there is something called *dravya-ved* and something called *bhava-ved*. The obstacle of *purusha-ved* is like the fire of straw, the obstacle of *stri-ved* is like the fire of kindling wood, and the obstacle of *nasaka-ved* is like the fire of a kiln for baking bricks. 137. Question: Where does the good conduct of *ved* remain? Answer: The good conduct of *stri-ved* and *napumsaka-ved* remains until the fifth *guna-sthana*, and the good conduct of *purusha-ved* remains until the fourteenth *guna-sthana*.

Question: What is *kṣaya*? How many types are there? Answer: That which destroys the qualities of *samyak-tva* etc. of the soul is called *kṣaya*. *Krodha-mana-maya-lobha* with infinite attachments, *krodha-mana-maya-lobha* with non-rejection covering, *krodha-mana-maya-lobha* with rejection covering, *krodha-mana-maya-lobha* with burning, and *hasya-rati-arati-soka-bhaya-jugupsa-stri-ved-purusha-ved* and *napumsaka-ved*, these are the 25 types of *kṣaya*. In comparison to the places of arising, there are also countless types of *kṣaya* according to the number of worlds. 1. Whatever *bhava-ved* is obtained in any desired *paryaya* of a living being, that same *bhava-ved* remains throughout life, it does not change. *Dhavla* 1/34 (67)

136. Question: What are the *ananubandhi* kṣayās called?
Answer: Since *mithyātva* is the cause of the infinite world, it is called infinite. The *kṣayās* that are connected with this infinite, i.e., which destroy the *samyaktvaguna* of the soul, are called *ananta-anubandhi* kṣayās. 1

140. Question: What are the *apratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa*, *pratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa*, and *sanjvalana* kṣayās?
Answer: The *kṣayās* that destroy *ekadeśa-cāritra* are called *apratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa* kṣayās. The *kṣayās* that destroy *sakala-cāritra* are called *pratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa* kṣayās. The *kṣayās* that destroy *yathākhyāta-cāritra* are called *sanjvalana* kṣayās.

1. *Ananta-anubandhi* is also said to be destructive of *cāritra* along with *samyaktvaguna* (Dhavala 1/164, Pañcādhyāyī Uttarārdha 1140). This is also correct. The point is that the function of *ananta-anubandhi* kṣayās is to maintain the infinite flow of *apratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa* etc. kṣayās. It (the *ananta-anubandhi*) itself does not obtain any *cāritra*. (Dhavala 6, p. 42) | The activity of the *ananta-anubandhi* quartet in *cāritra* is not futile either, because the *cāritra* is destroyed by the infinite flow of *apratyakhyāna-āvaraṇa* etc. which is caused by the *ananta-anubandhi* kṣayās, which is contrary to the futility of the *ananta-anubandhi* kṣayās (Dhavala 6/43); thus the dual nature of the *ananta-anubandhi* is established.

143. Question: Up to which guṇasthāna does the arising of which kṣayā occur?
Answer: The arising of anantānubandhī kṣayā occurs up to the second guṇasthāna, the arising of apratyākhyānāvaraṇa occurs up to the fourth guṇasthāna, the arising of pratyākhyānāvaraṇa occurs up to the fifth guṇasthāna, and the arising of sanjvalana occurs up to the tenth guṇasthāna.

The rise of the Vedas remains until the *savad* part of the ninth *gunasthan*. From the eleventh *gunasthan* onwards, there is a state free from *kashāya*.

144. Question: What is *prashna jnana*?
Answer: The knowledge by which a living being knows the *dravya*, *guna*, and their various *paryaya* pertaining to the three times is called *prashna jnana*.

145. Question: How many types of *jnana* are there?
Answer: There are five types of *jnana*: (1) *matijnana*, (2) *shrutajnana*, (3) *avadhijnana*, (4) *man:paryayajnana*, and (5) *kevaljnana*. *Mati* and *shrutajnana* are indirect knowledge, *avadhi* and *man:paryayajnana* are *deshapratyaksha*, and *kevaljnana* is *sakalpratyaksha*. *Mati*, *shruta*, *avadhi*, and *man:paryaya* are the four types of *kshayopashamic jnana*, and *kevaljnana* is *kshayik jnana*.

146. Question: What is *matijnana*?
Answer: The knowledge of an object that is *abhimukh* (situated in a suitable field) and *niyat* (the fixed object of its respective sense organ, such as the form of the eye) with the help of the senses and mind is called *abhinibodhik* or *matijnana*. 

Page #77:
---------------------------
147. Question: How many types of Matigyan are there? What is their nature?
Answer: There are four types of Matigyan. 1. Avgraha: When there is a relationship between the object and the senses in the form of a state in the appropriate field, there is a general observation-like perception, and after this, there is Avgraha knowledge that takes in the specific shape, etc. For example, 'This is a human being.' There are two types of Avgraha: (a) Vyanjanavgraha: The meaning associated with the senses and the unmanifest meaning is called Vyanjan, i.e., even when associated with the senses, it is called Vyanjan until it is manifested, and the knowledge of this is called Vyanjanavgraha. This knowledge occurs through the remaining four senses, excluding the eye and mind. For example, the initial unmanifest perception of words, etc., through the ear, etc., is called Vyanjanavgraha. (b) Arthavgraha: The knowledge that occurs regarding the unacquired, unassociated meaning is called Arthavgraha, which occurs after Vyanjanavgraha - for example, perceiving words, etc., through the ear, etc., in a manifest form. This knowledge occurs through all five senses and the mind. 
(72) 

Page #78:
---------------------------
(2) **Iha:** The effort to know a specific object through **avagraha** is called **Iha** knowledge. For example, "This man should be from the south." (3) **Avaya:** The decisive knowledge of the object known through **Iha** knowledge is called **Avaya**. For example, "The man is indeed from the south." (4) **Dharana:** The knowledge of the object known through **Avaya** that is not forgotten over time is called **Dharana**. For example, "I had seen a man from the south."  **Avagraha** knowledge is only present for unclear, acquired, or implied objects. Clear objects have all four types of knowledge. 148. Question: How many types of objects are there with respect to **matijnan**? Answer: There are twelve types of objects with respect to **matijnan**. (1) **Bahu:** Many objects of the same kind are called **bahu**. For example, knowledge of a quantity of wheat. (2) **Bahuvidha:** Many objects of different kinds are called **bahuvidha**. For example, knowledge of quantities of wheat, chickpeas, rice, etc. (3) **Alp:** One or two objects of the same kind are called **alp**. For example, 
(73) 

Page #79:
---------------------------
:
Knowledge of wheat etc. (4) Alpavidha: One or two substances of many kinds are called alpavidha. For example, knowledge of one wheat, gram, rice etc. (5) Kshipra: A substance that moves quickly is called kshipra, for example, a fast flowing stream of water. (6) Akshipra: A substance that moves slowly is called akshipra, for example, the speed of a tortoise etc. (7) Anissruta: The knowledge of the whole object by seeing a part of the object is called anissruta. For example, knowing the whole elephant by seeing its trunk submerged in water. The knowledge of another object by grasping a part or the whole object and its cause is also called anissruta. For example, knowing the moon by seeing the face. (8) Nissruta: A manifest object is called nissruta. For example, an elephant standing in front. (6) Anukta: The object that is understood by intention is called anukta, for example, knowing a thirsty man by the expression of his face and gestures of his hands etc. (10) Ukta: That which is said by words is called ukta. (11) Dhruva: A stable object is called dhruva, for example, a mountain etc. (12) Adhruva: A temporary object is called adhruva, for example, lightning etc.

---------------------------
There are 4 types of *vyanjanavgraha* (excluding the eyes and mind, in relation to the 4 senses) and 24 types of *arthaavgraha* (6 x 4) = 24 types (five senses and mind, these six and *avgraha*, *iha*, *avaya*, *dharana*). Thus, in the aforementioned twelve types of substances, there is a tendency of 28 types, so 28 x 12 = 336 types of *matijnana*.

146. Question: What is *shrutajnana*? How many types are there?
Answer: *Shrutajnana* is the knowledge of a different substance, taking the substance known through *matijnana* as a basis. *Shrutajnana* occurs only after *matijnana*. There are two types of *shrutajnana*: (1) *aksharatmika* and (2) *anakshatatmika*. *Aksharatmika*, meaning word-based *shrutajnana*, is the main type, because in the path to liberation and in all worldly transactions, such as giving and taking, words and the understanding derived from them are of primary importance. *Anaksharatmika* *shrutajnana* is found in all beings, from those with one sense to those with five senses, but it is not useful in worldly transactions or in the path to liberation.

---------------------------
150. Question: What is the measure of *anakshatraatmika* and *akshatraatmika* *shrutagyaan*?
Answer: From the most inferior to the most superior place of *anakshatraatmika* *shrutagyaan*, which is like *paryaaya* and *paryaayasamaas*, there are countless *loka* measures of difference, in comparison to the six *sthana* based increases of *anantabhaagavruddi*, *asankhyaatabhaagavruddi*, *sankhyaatabhaagavruddi*, *sankhyaatgunavruddi*, *asankhyaatgunavruddi*, and *anantagunavruddi*. The measure of *akshatraatmika* *shrutagyaan* is one less than the measure of the sixth *varga* in the *dvirupayvargadhaara*, which is the measure of one *ekatti*. 
151. Question: In detail, how many types of *shrutagyaan* are there?
Answer: There are twenty types of *shrutagyaan*:
(1) *Paryaaya*, (2) *Paryaayasamaas*, (3) *Akshara*, (4) *Akshara-samaas*, (5) *Pada*, (6) *Padasamaas*, (7) *Sanghaat*, (8) *Sanghaatsamaas*, (9) *Pratipattika*, (10) *Pratipattika Samaas*, (11) *Anuyog*, (12) *Anuyogsamaas*, (13) *Praabhrutpraabhrut*, (14) *Praabhrutpraabhrutsamaas*, (15) *Praamrut*, (16) *Praabhrutsamaas*, (17) *Vastu*, (18) *Vastusamaas*, (19) *Purva*, and (20) *Purvasamaas*.

152. Question: What is the nature of Paryaya-Jnana? Who are its masters? Answer: In one Antarmukhurta of a Sukshma-Nigodaya Labdhya-Paryapta Jiva, a maximum of 6012 Bhavas are possible. The Jiva, while traversing through them, acquires the last inadequate body through three turns. At the time of the first turn, the most inferior knowledge, which is in the form of Akshara, obtained through the knowledge of the mind generated by the sense of touch, is called Paryaya-Jnana. Its only characteristic is that the fruit of the Karma that covers it does not manifest in this Paryaya-Jnana. Because if the fruit of Paryaya-Avarana Karma becomes Paryaya-Jnana, then due to the lack of knowledge-use, the Jiva would also cease to exist. However, at least the Paryaya-rupa knowledge is definitely found in the Jiva. This makes this knowledge Avarana-free because the effect of the Shruta-Jnana-Avarana called Paryaya, which obstructs it, falls on the Paryaya-Samasa-Jnana, not on the Paryaya-Jnana. 153. Question: How many types of Akshara-Atmaka Shruta-Jnana are there? Answer: There are two types of Akshara-Atmaka Shruta-Jnana: (1) Anga-Pravist and (2) Anga-Bahya. Anga-Pravist has twelve types: (1) Acharaanga,

(14) Nishiddhika. 154. Question: How many letters are there in Shrutagyan that are not repeated? Answer: In the original, there are 27 vowels, 33 consonants and 4 Yogavah (Anuswar, Visarga, Jamuliya and Upadhmniya), thus 64 original letters. Their combined permutations are 64 multiplied by itself, minus one, which is 18446744073706551615. This is the total number of letters in Shruta that are not repeated, both internal and external. 155. Question: How many letters are there in one pada? How many padas are there in the Dvadasanga? Answer: One pada has sixteen hundred thirty-four crore eighty-three lakh seven thousand eight hundred eighty-eight letters (1634,83,7888). This is the number of letters in the Madhyama pada. The total number of padas in the Dvadasanga is one hundred twelve crore eighty-two lakh fifty-eight thousand five (112,82,58,005).

156. Question: What is the proof of the letters of Angabahya?
Answer: The proof of the letters of Angabahya is eight crore one lakh, eight thousand one hundred seventy-five (8,01,08,175). One cannot be formed from this, therefore it is called Angabahya.
157. Question: What is Avadhijnana?
Answer: Avadhijnana is the knowledge that has a limit to its subject matter in relation to dravya, kshetra, kala, and bhava, due to the destruction and pacification of the Avadhijnana-avarana karma. The living being who possesses this knowledge knows the substance that is located in its field of knowledge without the help of senses, light, etc.
158. Question: How many types of Avadhijnana are there?
Answer: There are two types of Avadhijnana: 1. Bhavapratyay: The Avadhijnana that occurs due to bhava is called Bhavapratyay Avadhijnana. This knowledge is possessed by Devas, Narakis, and Tirthankaras, and it arises from all parts. 2. Guna-Pratyay: The Avadhijnana that occurs due to qualities like Samyagdarshan and Tapascharana is called Guna-Pratyay Avadhijnana. This knowledge is possessed by some worthy humans and sentient five-sensed Tiryanchas, not all.

This is also called **kshayopasham nimittak avadhigyan**. This knowledge arises from conch etc. signs. 156. Question: How many types of **gunapratyay avadhigyan** are there? Answer: There are six types of **gunapratyay avadhigyan**.
1. **Anugami**: The **avadhigyan** that goes with its owner (Jiva) is called **anugami**. It has three types: (a) The one that goes with its owner to another **kshetra** is called **kshetranugami**. (b) The one that goes with its owner to another **bhav** is called **bhavanugami**. (c) The one that goes with its owner to another **kshetra** and **bhav** both is called **ubhayanugami**. 2. **Ananugami**: The **avadhigyan** that does not go with its owner (Jiva) is called **ananugami**. It also has three types: (a) **kshetrananugami** (b) **bhavananugami** and (c) **ubhayananugami**. (3) **Vardhman**: The **avadhigyan** that increases till its final stage like the moon in the **shukla paksha** is called **vardhman avadhigyan**. (4) **Hiyaman**: The **avadhigyan** that decreases till its final stage like the moon in the **krishna paksha** is called **hiyaman avadhigyan**. (5) **Avasthit**: The **avadhigyan** that neither decreases nor increases like the **surya mandala** is called **avasthit**. (6) **Anavasthit**: The **avadhigyan** that sometimes decreases and sometimes increases like the **chandra mandala** is called **anavasthit**.

160. Question: How many types of *avadhijnana* are there, other than the ones already mentioned? Answer: There are three types of *avadhijnana*: (1) *deshavadhi*, (2) *paramavadhi*, and (3) *sarvavadhi*. *Deshavadhi* knowledge can occur in all four *gatis*, but *paramavadhi* and *sarvavadhi* knowledge only occur in the human *gati* and only in *charmashiri* monks, not in others. *Deshavadhi* knowledge is *pratipati*, it comes and goes, but *paramavadhi* and *sarvavadhi* are *apratipati*, they do not disappear before *kevaljnana* is attained. *Deshavadhi* knowledge is both *avastha* and *gunapratyay*. *Bhavapratyay* *avadhijnana* is only *deshavadhi*. The lowest *deshavadhi* knowledge occurs in both restrained and unrestrained humans, as well as in *desha-samyami* restrained and unrestrained beings. The highest *deshavadhi* knowledge occurs only in restrained beings.

161. Question: What is the extent of the object of the lowest *deshavadhi* in terms of substance, space, time, and feeling? Answer: The lowest *deshavadhi* knows the amount of substance that is obtained by giving the part of the *loka* to the accumulation of the *nokarma* classification with *sopacaya*. It cannot grasp a smaller *skandha* than this. The space

Compared to the subtle **nigoda** (subtle atom), the **labdhyaparyaptak** (capable of attaining liberation) living being knows a **tridasa** (third) number of **jambhya** (birth) **avasahat** (periods of existence). Compared to time, it knows a **praman** (measure) number of **avali** (a measure of time) parts of the **bhut-bhavishyat** (past and future) **sambandhi** (related) **dravya** (substance) **vyanjan-paryaya** (combinations of categories). Compared to **bhaya** (fear), it knows a **praman** number of **asankhyat** (innumerable) parts of the **paryaya** (categories) that it knows compared to time. It knows a **praman** number of **asankhyat** parts of the **paryaya** (categories) of the present time. 162. Question: How much is the subject matter of **utkrista deshavadhigyan** (supreme knowledge of the universe) in terms of **dravya** (substance), **kshetra** (space), **kal** (time), and **bhava** (emotion)? Answer: It knows a **dravya** (substance) as subtle as the result obtained by dividing the **dhruvahar** (a measure of time) once in the **karmanavargna** (a measure of time). It knows the entire **lok** (universe) in terms of **kshetra** (space). It knows one **kal** (time) less than one **paly** (a measure of time) in terms of **kal** (time). It knows **asankhyat** (innumerable) **lokpraman** (measure of the universe) **dravya** (substance) **paryaya** (categories) in terms of **bhava** (emotion). 163. Question: How much is the subject matter of **jghanya parmavithi jhan** (lowest knowledge of the universe) in terms of **dravya** (substance), **kshetra** (space), **kal** (time), and **bhava** (emotion)? Answer: It knows a **dravya** (substance) as subtle as the result obtained by dividing the **dhruvahar** (a measure of time) once in the **utkrista deshavadhi** (supreme knowledge of the universe) **dravya praman** (measure of substance).

The smallest particle of the Paramāvadhi is the proof. Multiplying the finest region of the Desāvadhi by an innumerable (an innumerable part of an Āvali) gives the proof of the smallest region of the Paramāvadhi. Multiplying the finest time of the Desāvadhi by an innumerable gives the proof of the smallest time of the Paramāvadhi. Multiplying the proof of the finest state of the Desāvadhi by an innumerable part of an Āvali gives the proof of the smallest state of the Paramāvadhi, because the state of the smallest particle of the Desāvadhi is in the form of a series multiplied by an innumerable part of an Āvali from the smallest Desāvadhi to the entire duration. Therefore, in relation to the state, multiplying the proof of the state related to the previous difference by an innumerable part of an Āvali gives the proof of the state related to the subsequent difference. 164. Question: How much is the subject of the finest Paramāvadhi in terms of particle, region, time, and state? Answer: The particle of the finest Paramāvadhi is Dhruvahara (which is an infinite part of the Siddhrāśi and an infinite multiple of the Abhavyarāśi) in proof. The region is innumerable Lokas in proof. The time is equal to the time of the regions of innumerable Lokas. The finest Paramāvadhi (84)

The feeling is multiplied by an innumerable part of the Avali from the feeling that is the subject of the two extreme distinctions of the Parmavadhi (for details see - Dhadana, 41-50 Go.Ji. 5 Me 12 and Thavala 13/322 to 325). 165. Question: How much is the subject of Sarvavadhi knowledge in terms of dravya-kshetra-kal-bhav? Answer: The dravya of Sarvavadhi is one atom. Multiplying the excellent kshetra, kal and bhav of Parmavadhi by innumerable, the kshetra, kal and bhav of Sarvavadhi comes. That is, multiplying the excellent kshetra of Parmavadhi by innumerable worlds worthy of it, the excellent kshetra of Sarvavadhi is obtained. Multiplying the kal of Parmavadhi by innumerable forms worthy of it, the excellent kal of Sarvavadhi is obtained.
1. Note: It should be known that the subject of Sarvavadhi is not an atom, but a skandha of infinite atoms, as many Acharyas say. (Rajyartik 1/24/2 p. 86 and its notes 3 and 6 and Shloka-Varttik part 4 p. 66 and 671 Shri Shruta Sagar Suri's Tatvarthavritti and Acharya Bhaskaranandi's 'Sukhabodh' commentary should also be seen). Thus, two teachings are received regarding the dravya of Sarvavadhi knowledge, one atom form, the other skandha form.

The supreme emotion of Parāvādī, multiplied by its countless worthy forms, becomes the supreme emotion of Sarvāvādī. (See Dhavala 6/47-51; Go.Ji. 413-423) 166. Question: What is the extent of the field of knowledge of the beings in the hellish, animal, and human realms? Answer: The extent of the field of knowledge of the hellish beings in the seventh hell is one kos. Above this, the extent of the field of knowledge of the hellish beings in the first hell increases by half a kos in each successive hell, so that the extent of the field of knowledge of the hellish beings in the first hell is a full yojana. The knowledge of the animals ranges from the lowest country-knowledge to the knowledge of the country that is the object of the luminous body, in accordance with their excellence. In the human realm, the knowledge of humans ranges from the lowest country-knowledge to the highest, Sarvāvādī. 167. Question: What is the extent of the field of knowledge in the heavenly realm? Answer: The lowest extent of the field of knowledge of the Bhavanavāsī and Vyantara is 25 yojanas. The knowledge of the Jyotishī Devas... (6)

The **kṣetra** is multiplied by the number. The **bhavanatrik** devas' **avadhi** **kṣetra** decreases downwards and increases laterally. The **bhavanavāsi** devas can see from their location to the peak of **Meru**. The devas of the **Saudharm-Aiśān** heaven have a **kṣetra** of **avapijñāna** downwards:

* First **bhūmi** to **Sanatkumāra-Mahendra**
* Second " **Brahma-Brahmottara** **Sāntava-Kāpiṣṭa**
* Third " **Śuka-Mahāśukra** **Śatāra-Sahasrāra** **Ānata-Prāṇata** **Āraṇa-Acyuta**
* Fourth " **Nava** **Aveyaka-Vāsi**
* Fifth " **Nava** **Anudiś** and five **Sampoorna** **Lokanāḍī** to **Anuttaravāsi**

They see through their **avadhi**. 

168. Question: What is **manaḥparyaya-jñāna**? Answer: It is the knowledge of another's mind, without the help of external stimuli like the senses, of thoughts that have been thought in the past (**cintita**) or will be thought in the future (**acintita**). 

Page #93:
---------------------------
(It will be contemplated) or the substance in the form of half-contemplated (which is being contemplated at present) is known clearly, it is called **Manahparyaya Jnana**. This knowledge is only available to the **Munis** in the human realm, i.e., in the **Ardha-dvipa**. 166. Question: How many types of **Manahparyaya Jnana** are there? Answer: There are two types of **Manahparyaya Jnana**: (1) **Rijumati Manahparyaya Jnana** and (2) **Vipulmati Manahparyaya Jnana**. The one who knows the substance located in the mind of another, which is done through simple mind, speech, and body, is called **Rijumati Manahparyaya Jnana**. The one who knows the substance located in the mind of another, which is done through simple and crooked means, is called **Vipulmati Manahparyaya Jnana**. He knows the **Kashaya** of the other's mind, even when asked and not asked. 170. Question: Where does **Manahparyaya Jnana** originate from and who is its master? Answer: **Manahparyaya Jnana** originates from the regions of the soul where the **Dravyaman** is located. From the seven **Gunasthanas** from **Pramatta** to **Kshina-Kashaya**, in any one of them... 

Page #94:
---------------------------
Only those who possess the seven **riddhis** (psychic powers) from the **Gunasthanavati** (those who have attained the highest spiritual state), or at least one of them, and among the **riddhi-prapta** (those who have attained psychic powers), only the **Vardhaman** (the present Tirthankara) and the **vishist charitra-dhari muniraj** (the monks with exceptional character) can possess **manah-paryaya-gyan** (knowledge of the thoughts of others).

171. Question: What is the difference between **rijumati** and **vipulamati** **manah-paryaya-gyan**? Answer: The difference lies in their purity and the ability to perceive or not perceive. **Vipulamati** **manah-paryaya-gyan** is more pure than **rijumati** and **rijumati** is **pratipati** (perceiving) while **vipulamati** **manah-paryaya-gyan** is **apratipati** (not perceiving). A **rijumati** **manah-paryaya-gyani** first knows the object in another's mind through **iha-mati-gyan** (knowledge of the present) and then directly through **rijumati** **manah-paryaya-gyan** according to the rules. A **vipulamati** **manah-paryaya-gyani** directly knows the object in another's mind, which can be **chint** (thought), **achint** (unthought), or **ardha-chint** (half-thought), and many other variations.

172. Question: What is the characteristic of both types of knowledge in relation to substance, space, time, and feeling?
Answer: The inferior substance of the *ṛjūmati* mind-perception knowledge is the *audārika* body, which is a measure of time that is not destroyed, while the superior substance is the eye sense, which is a measure of substance that is not destroyed. The inferior space of the *ṛjūmati* is two to three *kośa* and the superior is seven to eight *yojana*. The inferior time of the *ṛjūmati* is two to three *bhavas* and the superior time is seven to eight *bhavas*. The inferior and superior feeling of the *ṛjūmati*, although a measure of an innumerable part of an *āvalī*, the superior is an innumerable times greater than the inferior. The inferior substance of the *vipulamati* is equal to what is obtained by dividing the superior substance of the *ṛjūmati* by a *dhūvahāra* (an infinite part of the *manodravya* class). The superior substance of the *vipulamati* is equal to what is obtained by dividing the second substance of the *vipulamati* mind-perception knowledge by a *dhūvahāra* an innumerable number of times, equal to the number of times in innumerable *kalpas*. 
(60) 

Page #96:
---------------------------
It is proven. The inferior realm of Vipulamati's Manahparyaya-jnana is eight to nine yojanas, and the superior realm is the human realm, which is proven. The inferior time of Vipulamati is seven to eight bhava, and the superior time is an innumerable part of a palya, which is proven. In terms of bhava, the inferior subject of Vipulamati is innumerable times greater than the superior subject of Rijumati, and the superior subject is innumerable lokas, which is proven.

173. Question: What is Kevalajnana? Answer: One who knows all the dravyas and their all paryaya, like the present paryaya, is called Kevalajnana. Kevalajnana is the most excellent paryaya of jnanaguna, its avibhagpraticchedha are excellent, infinite, and innumerable.

1. Here, the diameter of the human realm should be taken from the human realm, not the circle, because the Vipulamati Manahparyaya-jnani knows the objects thought about by the tiryanch and devas located in the four corners outside the Manushottara mountain, because the superior realm of Manahparyaya-jnana is 45 lakh yojanas in the form of a square, even though it is less in height. (Go.Ji.Ga. 456). The word Manushottara Shaila is an upalakshanabhuta, therefore, it is proven that they know the objects of the nikalagochar padarthas, which are the objects of knowledge of the beings located within these 45 lakh yojanas. Yaval 13/343-344, Dhaval 6/68, Jayaghaval 1/17, 1/18, 1/16.

A being who, despite being a Bhavya, never attains liberation is called a Duradur-Bhavya. These beings are found only in the Nitya-Nigoda. Just as a widowed woman who is free from the defect of infertility has the potential to give birth to a child, but will never give birth to a child because external factors are not available, so too, in the Nitya-Nigoda, the absence of external materials prevents the attainment of liberation.

218. Question: How many types of Dravya transformations are there and what is their nature?
Answer: There are two types of Dravya transformations: (1) Nokarmadravya transformation and (2) Karmadravya transformation.

Nokarmadravya transformation: A living being, at one time, has taken in pudgalas suitable for the six Paryapti forms of transformation, related to any of the three bodies (Audarika, etc.), which are endowed with the intense, mild, and moderate qualities of Snigdha, Rooksha, Varna, Gandha, etc., to the best of its ability. Later, in the second and subsequent times, it has exhausted that Dravya. Later, it has taken in and released ungrasped pudgalas an infinite number of times, taken in and released mixed Dravya an infinite number of times, and taken in and released grasped Dravya an infinite number of times. When the same living being takes in the same pudgalas endowed with the same Snigdha, Rooksha, etc., qualities, from the beginning to that period of time, it is called Nokarmadravya transformation. 

Page #116:
---------------------------
## Karmadravya Parivartan:

A living being, at a particular time, takes in Karma-pudgaldravya, suitable for the eight karmas, with varying intensities of qualities like smoothness, roughness, color, and fragrance. After an Avli period, the process of depletion of the acquired Karmadravya begins. Subsequently, the being acquires and releases countless unacquired pudgals, acquires and releases countless mixed dravyas, and acquires and releases countless acquired pudgals! The period from the initial acquisition of these pudgals with the same qualities of smoothness, roughness, etc., to the subsequent acquisition of the same pudgals, is called Karmadravya Parivartan. The combination of Nokarmadravya Parivartan and Karmadravya Parivartan is called Dravya Parivartan.

## Kshetra Parivartan:

**Question:** How many types of Kshetra Parivartan are there, and what is their nature?

**Answer:** There are two types of Kshetra Parivartan:

1. **Sva-Kshetra Parivartan:** A living being, after acquiring the lowest level of Avgahana for a period equal to the extent of the lowest Avgahana, gradually acquires higher and higher levels of Avgahana, ultimately reaching the level of Mahamatsya (111). 

2. **Para-Kshetra Parivartan:** 

Page #117:
---------------------------
A **Svakshetra Parivartan** is a period of time during which a being can hold as many **Avgahnas** as possible until reaching the **Utkrishta Avgahana**. 

**Parakshetra Parivartan**: A being holding a **Jghanya Avgahana**, a **Sukshm Nigodhya Labya Paryaptak Jiva**, is born in the **Asta Madhya Pradesh** of the **Sudarshan Meru**, below the **Achal Roop** of the **Lok**, making it their body. Later, the same being is born again in the same place, in the same form, for a second or third time. In this way, the being is born in the same place, in sequence, as many times as there are **Pradesh** of the **Jghanya Avgahana**, which is a fraction of the **Ghanangal**. The being then experiences **Kshudra Aayu**, which is one-eighteenth of a **Shwas**, and dies. Later, the being takes birth in the entire **Lok**, in sequence, over a period of time, which is equal to the number of times the being is born in each **Pradesh**. This period of time is called a **Parakshetra Parivartan**.

**Question**: What is **Kal Parivartan**?

**Answer**: A being is born for the first time in the first **Samay** of the **Utsarpini**. Similarly, the being is born for the second time in the second **Samay** of the second **Utsarpini**. In this way, the being is born in sequence, in all the **Samay** of the twenty **Koda Kodi Sagar** of the **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini**. The being then dies in the same sequence. 

Page #118:
---------------------------
It is received, the time period taken for this is called a Kalasamudaya.
221. Question: What is called a Bhaya Parivartan?
Answer: A being is born in the first hell from the lowest age of ten thousand years, as many times as there are ten thousand years. Afterwards, it has completed the highest age of thirty-three Sagars related to hell-existence in a gradual order of one time each. After that, it is born in the Tiryanch-Gati from the lowest age of Antarmuhurt, as many times as there are Antarmuhurts, and here also, similar to the hell-goers, it has completed the highest age of three Palyas related to Tiryanch-Gati in a gradual order of one time each. After that, it has completed the Manushya-Gati similar to the Tiryanch-Gati, because in Manushya-Gati also, the lowest age is Antarmuhurt and the highest age is three Palyas. After Manushya-Gati, it is born in Dev-Gati from the lowest age of ten thousand years, as many times as there are ten thousand years, and afterwards, it has completed the age of thirty-one Sagars in a gradual order of one time each, because the highest age of Mithyadrishti Dev is only up to thirty-one Sagars. The time taken to travel through all four Gatis in this order is called Bhaya Parivartan. (113) 

Page #119:
---------------------------
That much time is called a **bhaava-parivartan** (cycle of rebirth) and the journey undertaken in that time is called **bhaava-parivartan**. These changes are described from the perspective of **mithyaadrishti** (false vision) because **samyagdristi** (right vision) souls do not remain in the world for more than the time of the **ardhapadagal parivartan pramaan** (half-cycle of rebirth). 222. Question: What causes **bhaava-parivartan**? Answer: **Yogasthan**, **anubhaagbandh adhyavasaayasthan**, **kashay adhyaksayasthan** or **sthiitibandh adhyavasaayasthan** and **sthiitiasthan** cause **bhaava-parivartan**. 223. Question: What is **yogasthan**? Answer: The **tartam** (highest) form of the **yog** (state of being bound) which is the **pradesh-parispandan** (vibration of the soul) caused by the **prakriti** (nature) and **pradesh** (region) bond is called **yogasthan**. 224. Question: What is **anubhaagbandh adhyavasaayasthan**? Answer: The **tartam** form of the **kashayas** (passions) from which **anubhaagbandh** (bond of karma) occurs is called **anubhaagbandh adhyavasaayasthan**. 225. Question: What is **sthiitibandh adhyavasaayasthan**? Answer: The **kashay-parinarm** (transformation of passions) that cause **sthiitibandh** (bond of existence) is called **sthiitibandh adhyavasaayasthan**. (114)

226. Question: What is **sthiti-sthān**? Answer: The **jghanya** (lowest) state of **bandha** (bondage) is called **sthiti-sthān**. 227. Question: What is **māyā-parivartan**? Answer: When countless **yoga-sthān** (stages of yoga) of a **śreṇī** (category) are completed, there is one **anubhāga-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthān** (stage of determination of the section of bondage). When countless **loka-pramaṇ** (world-measure) **anubhāga-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthān** are completed, there is one **sthiti-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthān** (stage of determination of the state of bondage). When countless **loka-pramaṇ** **sthiti-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthān** are completed, there is one **sthiti-sthān**. In this way, when all the **sthān** (stages) of all the **mūla-prakrti** (original nature) and **uttara-prakrti** (derived nature) are completed, there is a **bhāva-parivartan** (change in state). For a **saṁjñī** (cognizant) **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** (false-seeing) **jīva** (soul) with sufficient **karma** (action), the **bandha** of the **jghanya** state of **jñāna-āvaraṇa** (knowledge-obscuring karma) is **anta-koḍī-sāgara-pramaṇ** (countless as the ocean of the end of the universe). This is the **jghanya** state here, therefore, for the **vivakṣita** (intended) **jīva** who is eligible for this, there are only **jghanya** **anubhāga-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthān**, only **jghanya** **kaṣāya-adhyavasāya-sthān** (stage of determination of the passions), and only **jghanya** **yoga-sthān**. From here, **bhāva-parivartan**... (115)

The beginning takes place. That is, after an innumerable number of parts of the series in the order of the Pramana Yoga Sthanas, the second section is the Bandha Adhyavasaya Sthana. After that, again, after an innumerable number of parts of the series in the order of the Pramana Yoga Sthanas, the third section is the Bandha Adhyavasaya Sthana. In this way, after an innumerable number of Lokapramana Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasaya Sthanas, the second Kashaya Adhyavasaya Sthana takes place. In the same way, after an innumerable number of Lokapramana Kashaya Adhyavasaya Sthanas, the same Jghanya Sthiti Sthana takes place. The order that was described in the Jghanya Sthiti Sthana, the same should be known in the Dvitiyaadi Sthiti Sthanas, one at a time, and in this way, after all the Sthiti Sthanas from the Jghanya Sthiti of Jnanaavaran to the Utkrushta Sthiti, and after all the Sthiti Sthanas of the Mula and Uttar Prakritis in the same order as the Sthiti Sthanas of Jnanaavaran are complete, there is a change in the state.
In all the changes, where there is a break in the order, the complete change is not counted, it is counted again from the beginning.

228. Question: What are the characteristics of the six substances? Answer: That which is used in the form of knowledge and perception is called the Jiva substance. That which has the qualities of color, smell, taste, and touch is called the Pudgala substance. That which, while moving itself, is an indifferent cooperative cause for the movement of the Jiva and Pudgala substances is called the Dharma substance, like a path for a traveler. That which, while remaining stationary itself, is an indifferent cooperative cause for the Jiva and Pudgala substances to remain stationary is called the Adharma substance, like a seat for one who is sitting. That which is helpful in giving space to all the substances is called the Akasha substance, like a house for those who reside. That which is a cooperative cause for all the substances to function in their own nature is called the Kala substance, i.e., the cooperative cause that tells the substances how to function, the quality of functioning is found in it, that is called the Kala substance. 226. Question: How does the Kala substance, the cause of functioning, occur in all the substances? Answer: It is not the case that the Kala substance, being a result, becomes transformed into another substance. It neither transforms itself into another substance nor does it transform other substances into its own form. 

Page #123:
---------------------------
Or, a different substance-form arises, but in the transformation of substances that transform into their own appropriate permutations by their own nature, time-substance becomes an external cooperative cause with indifference. By means of subtle, infinite, indivisible, intersecting, non-gross, and minute qualities, the dharma-etc. substances undergo transformation in the form of gain and loss of the six qualities. 230. Question: What is called a *samaya*? Answer: The time taken by an atom located in one region of space to reach another contiguous region by slow motion is called one *samaya*. The lowest state of permutation of all substances is just one *kshana*, which is also called *samaya*. 231. Question: What is called a *pradesa*? Answer: The region of space occupied by one indivisible atom of *pudgala* in the *loka-akasha* is called a *pradesa*. 232. Question: What is called the lowest and highest *antar-muhurta*? Answer: The time period of one *samaya* along with the *avali* measure is called the lowest *antar-muhurta*, and the time period of one *samaya* less the *muhurta* is called the highest *antar-muhurta*.

233. Question: What are Vyajan Paryaya and Arth Paryaya? How many types are there? Answer: The gross Paryayas which are the subject of speech are called Vyajan Paryaya, or the Paryaya of the qualities of Pradeshvatva Guna related to the three times (Trikal) is Vyajan Paryaya. The subtle Paryayas which are not the subject of speech are called Arth Paryaya, or all the Paryayas related to the three times (Trikal) of the remaining ganas except Pradeshvatva Guna are Arth Paryaya. Both of these have two types each. (1) The Vyajan Paryaya which is without any other cause is called Svabhav Vyajan Paryaya, for example, the Siddha Paryaya of a Jiva. And (2) The Vyajan Paryaya which is due to another cause is called Vibhav Vyajan Paryaya, for example, the Narakadi Paryaya of a Jiva. (1) The Arth Paryaya which is without any other cause is called Svabhav Arth Paryaya, for example, the Kevalgyan of a Jiva. And (2) The Arth Paryaya which is due to another cause is called Vibhav Arth Paryaya, for example, the Ragadveshadi of a Jiva. 234. Question: How many are the six Dravyas? Answer: The Jiva Dravya are infinite, the Pudgal Dravya are infinite times more than them, Dharma, Adharma and Akash are all three indivisible and one each. The number of Kal Dravya is equal to the number of Pradesh of Lokakash (Asankhyat). (116) 

Page #125:
---------------------------
235. Question: Are the provinces of substances moving, stationary, or both?
Answer: The eight fleshy provinces located in the middle part of the body of all worldly beings are stationary. The remaining provinces are moving and both moving and stationary because worldly beings are in an unstable state. The provinces of beings in the state of *vigraha-gati* are only moving. The provinces of liberated beings are stationary and unmoving because they are in a stable state. The provinces of the substances of Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala are stationary and unmoving because they are stable substances. In the substance of Pudgala, all the *skandhas* of atoms and countable, uncountable, etc. molecules are moving, but the final *maha-skandha* is both moving and stationary. 

236. Question: How many types of *pudgala* classifications are there? How many of them are *grama* classifications?
Answer: There are twenty-three types of *pudgala* classifications: (1) *Anu* classification, (2) *Sankhyata* classification, (3) *Asankhyata* classification, (4) *Ananta* classification, (5) *Aahara* classification, (6) *Agrahya* classification, (7) *Taijasa* classification, (8) *Agrahya* classification, (9) *Bhasha* classification, (10) *Agrahya* classification, (11) *Mano* classification, (12) *Agrahya* classification, (13) *Karmana* classification...

## Translation:

**Vargana (14) Dhruva Vargana (15) Santara-Nirantara Vargana (16) Shunya Vargana (17) Pratyek Sharee Vargana (18) Dhruva Shunya Vargana (16) Badar Nigod Vargana (20) Shunya Vargana (21) Sukshma Nigod Vargana (22) Nabho Vargana and (23) Maha Skandha Vargana.**

**Out of these twenty-three Varganas, Ahar Vargana, Taijas Vargana, Bhasha Vargana, Mano Vargana and Karman Vargana are the five Grahya Varganas.**

**Question 237: What are the five types of Pradha Varganas and their creations?**

**Answer:** Ahar Vargana creates the three bodies - Audarik, Vaikriyik and Aharak, and also the breath. Taijas Vargana creates the Taijas body. Bhasha Vargana creates the four types of speech. Mano Vargana creates the mind, which is a substance in the heart region, shaped like an eight-petaled lotus. Karman Vargana creates the eight types of Karma.

**Question 238: What are the different types of Pudgal Dravya and their nature?**

**Answer:** There are six types of Pudgal Dravya: (9) The Skandha which can be pierced, broken and acquired elsewhere is called Badar-Badar. (125) 

Page #127:
---------------------------
(1) Those which can be pierced and broken, and can be obtained elsewhere, are called **Skandha**, like earth, wood, stone, etc. (2) Those which cannot be pierced or broken, but can be obtained elsewhere, are called **Badar**, like water, oil, etc. (3) Those which cannot be pierced or broken, and cannot be obtained elsewhere, and are visible to the eye, are called **Badar-sukshma**, like shadow, sunlight, moonlight, etc. (4) The **Pudgala Skandha** which is the object of the four senses other than the eye, is called **Sukshma-sthula**, like sound, smell, taste, etc. (5) The **Pudgala Skandha** which is not perceived by any sense organ, and is beyond the reach of the senses, is called **Sukshma**, like **Karma**. (6) The **Pudgala** atoms which are indivisible and have no form, are called **Sukshma-sukshma**.

236. Question: What are **Skandha**, **Skandha-desh**, **Skandha-pradesh**, and **Paramanu**? Answer: That which is complete in all aspects is called **Skandha**. Half of **Skandha** is called **Skandha-desh**. Half of **Skandha-desh** is called **Skandha-pradesh**. That which is indivisible is called **Paramanu**. (122) 

Page #128:
---------------------------
240. Question: How do indivisible pudgala atoms transform into skandha form? Answer: There are two alternatives for any particular quality: smoothness and roughness. These are the causes of binding. There are countless, infinite variations of these alternatives, from one to countless, compared to the indivisible intersections (the non-existent parts of power). Binding occurs in at least two atoms. So, these two atoms can be smooth or rough, or one smooth and one rough, and binding can occur. In both smoothness and roughness, binding occurs where there is an increase of two in the two qualities (a two-quality smooth or rough with a four-quality smooth or rough, and a three-quality smooth or rough with a five-quality smooth or rough), but the binding of atoms with the lowest quality (one non-existent part) does not occur. The atom with more qualities transforms the atom with fewer qualities into its own form. 241. Question: What is astikaya? How many types are there? Answer: That which is real is called asti, and that which has many regions is called kaya. There are two types of kaya: (1) (123) 

Page #129:
---------------------------
Those which are **akhandapradeshi** - having many undivided **pradeshas** - are called **mukhya kaya**, such as jiva, dharma, adharma, and akasha. (2) Those whose **pradeshas** are divided (**prithak-prithak**), but which have attained unity due to the binding effect of **snigdha-ruksha** qualities, or which have the potential to attain unity due to binding, are called **upcharit kaya**, such as pudgala.  **Kaladravya** does not possess either of these qualities. It is not **mukhya kaya** because it is not itself **anekapradeshi**, and it does not have the potential to attain unity due to binding because it does not possess **snigdha-ruksha** qualities. Therefore, **kaladravya** is not **upcharit kaya** either. Thus, excluding **kaladravya**, the remaining five substances - **jiva**, **pudgala**, **dharma**, **adharma**, and **akasha** - are called **panchaastikaya**. **Kaladravya** is not a **kaya** (body), but it is a form of **asti** (existence). 242. Question: How many types of **padartha** (substance) are there? What is their nature? Answer: Fundamentally, there are two **padarthas**: **jiva** and **ajiva**. Both have two types each: **punya** (merit) and **papa** (demerit), making a total of four **padarthas**. **Jiva** and **ajiva** also have five types each: **anava**, **samvara**, **nirjara**, **bandha**, and **moksha** (124). 

Page #130:
---------------------------
There are nine substances that combine to form a being (jiva) which possesses knowledge, perception, and consciousness. That which does not possess consciousness is called an ajiva. Those who are endowed with the qualities of samyaktva (right faith) or who observe the vows are called punya-jiva, and those who are opposite to this are called papa-jiva. Inanimate objects like the jinabimba (image of the Tirthankara) and other ayatanas (sense organs) are called punya-ajiva, and inanimate objects like the anayatanas (non-sense organs) are called papa-ajiva. Similarly, auspicious karmas (actions) are called punya-ajiva and inauspicious karmas are called papa-ajiva. The state of being without karma, or the karmarupa (karma-body), or the results of the jiva that lead to karma, such as mithyatva (false belief) and other parinamas (transformations), or the atmapradesha parispandana (vibrations of the soul) that occur through the mind, speech, and body, and the causes of bondage are called asrava. The special relationship that produces the knowledge of oneness in many substances, or the special relationship of the soul and karma in the form of kshetravagah (mutual penetration), or the results of the jiva that are the cause of this, are called bandha. The cessation of asrava is called sambara. The partial destruction of bound karmas is called nirjara. The complete liberation of the soul from all karmas is called moksha.

243. Question: How many individual beings are there in each of the five *guna sthānas* from *mithyātva* to the fifth *guna sthāna*? Answer: There are countless *mithyādṛṣṭi* beings. In *deśa-saṃyata*, there are thirteen crore humans and countless times more *tiryac* beings. In *sāsādana* *guna sthāna*, there are fifty-two crore humans and countless times more beings of the remaining three *gatis* than *śrāvakas*. In *mitra* *guna sthāna*, there are one hundred and four crore humans and countless times more beings of the remaining three *gatis* than those in *sāsādana* *guna sthāna*. In *avirata-samyakta* *guna sthāna*, there are seven hundred crore humans and countless times more beings of the remaining three *gatis* than those in *miśra* *guna sthāna*. 244. Question: How many individual beings are there in each of the *guna sthānas* from *pramatta-virata* to *ayogakevali* *guna sthāna*? Answer: The number of *saṃyata* beings in *pramatta* *guna sthāna* is five crore sixty-three lakh sixty-eight thousand two hundred and six (5,63,68,206). The number of *saṃyata* beings in *aprammatta* *guna sthāna* is two crore sixty-six lakh sixty-six thousand one hundred and three (2,66,66,103). The number of *saṃyata* beings in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh *guna sthānas* of the *upasama* *śreṇī* is 266 (126). 

Page #132:
---------------------------
Or 300 or 304. The number of restrained beings in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth Gunasthana, belonging to the Kshapaka category, is double that of those in the Upshama category, i.e., 568 or 600 or 608. The number of Sayoga-Kevali Jinas is eight lakh eighty-nine thousand five hundred two (8,68,502). The number of Ayoga-Kevali Jinas is 598 or 600 or 608. Thus, the total number of restrained beings is three less than nine crore (8,66,66,563). That is, the number of all restrained beings from the Pramala-Avarta Gunasthana to the fourteenth Gunasthana is three less than nine crore (assuming the number of beings in each category is 2E6).

245. Question: What is the number of beings who manifest in the Upshama and Kshapaka categories for eight consecutive times?
Answer: The number of beings who manifest in the Upshama category for eight consecutive times is: in the first time, a maximum of 16 beings, in the second time, 24 beings, in the third time, 30 beings, in the fourth time, 36 beings, in the fifth time, 42 beings, in the sixth time, 48 beings, in the seventh time, 54 beings, and in the eighth time, 
(127) 

Page #133:
---------------------------
There are 54 Jivas in the time cycle. In the Kshapaka category, there are twice as many, meaning 32 Jivas in the first time, 48 Jivas in the second time, E0 Jivas in the Khaniya time, 72 Jivas in the fourth time, 64 Jivas in the fifth time, 66 Jivas in the sixth time, 108 Jivas in the seventh time, and 108 Jivas in the eighth time.

246. Question: How many types of Samyaktvamargna are there?
Answer: There are six types of Samyaktvamargna: (1) Aupashmik Samyagdarshan, (2) Kshayopashmik Samyagdarshan, (3) Kshayik Samyagdarshan, (4) Mishr, (5) Sasadan, and (6) Mithyatva.

247. Question: What is Aupashmik Samyagdarshan?
Answer: Aupashmik Samyagdarshan is the Samyagdarshan that arises from the subsiding of the five natures of Aanadi Mithyadrishti Jiva, namely Mithyatva, and Anantaanubandhi Krodha-Mana-Maya-Lobha, and the subsiding of the seven natures of Saadi Mithyadrishti Jiva, namely Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva, Samyaktvam, and Anantaanubandhi Krodha-Mana-Maya-Lobha. 
(128) 

Page #134:
---------------------------
248. Question: How many types of *aupashamik samyagdarshan* are there? What is their nature?
Answer: There are two types of *aupashamik samyagdarshan*: (1) *Prathamopahsam samyagdarshan* and (2) *Dvitiyopahsam samyagdarshan*. *Prathamopahsam samyagdarshan* occurs in a *mithyadrishti* being due to the *upahsam* of 5 or 7 *prakritis*. *Prathamopahsam samyagdarshan* occurs from the fourth *gunasthan* to the seventh *gunasthan*. No one dies during the time of *Prathamopahsam samyaktva*. *Dvitiyopahsam samyagdarshan* occurs with the *upahsam* of the three *prakritis* of *darshanamohaniya* along with the *vinsaayog* (transformation of the *anantaanubandhi* into the form of *apratyakhyana* etc.) of the four *anantaanubandhi kshayas*. *Dvitiyopahsam samyagdarshan* arises in the seventh *gunasthan* of the being facing the ascent of the *shreni* and arises after *kshayopashamik samyagdarshan*. When the being falls from the eleventh *gunasthan* after ascending the *shreni*, it is also found in the sixth, fifth, and fourth *gunasthan*. In this regard, *Dvitiyopahsam samyagdarshan* is found from the fourth *gunasthan* to the eleventh *gunasthan*. *Dvitiyopahsam samyaktva* along with *upahsam* ascends the *shreni* 
(129) 

Page #135:
---------------------------
The beings who have the **apuurvakaran** quality do not die in the first **gunasthan**. In all **gunasthanas**, when they die during the **dvitiyopaśama** period, the being goes to the **devagati** according to the rules.

**246. Question:** What is **mayopashmik samyagdarshan**? 

**Answer:** The destruction of the **niṣeka** that arises in the present time of the six **sarvaghati-prakriti** - **mithyatva**, **samyagmithyatva**, and **anantaanubandhi krodha-mana-maya-lobha**; the **upaśama** in the form of **sadavastha** of the **niṣeka** that arises in the future time; and the **samyaktva prakriti** - the **deshaghati-prakriti** - remaining present, the **samyagdarshan** that occurs is called **kṣayopashmik samyagdarshan**. In this **samyaktva**, **malin** and **avagaḍha** defects arise due to the arising of **samyaktva prakriti**. This being experiences the arising of **samyaktva prakriti**, therefore their **samyaktva** is also called **vedak samyaktva**. This **samyagdarshan** occurs from the fourth **gunasthan** to the seventh **gunasthan**. The **bhayopashmik samyagdṛṣṭi** being, who is about to attain **kṣayik samyagdarshan**, experiences **mithyatva**, **samyagmithyatva**, and... 

Page #136:
---------------------------
The **Anantānubandhī Chatuṣka** destroys these six **Prakṛtis**, leaving only the **Samyaktva Prakṛti** to arise. When this happens, the being is called a **Kṛtakṛtyavedaka Samyagdṛṣṭi**, and this state lasts only for a **single Antarmūhūrta**. 250. Question: What is **Kṣāyika Samyagdṛṣṭi**? Answer: The **Samyagdṛṣṭi** that arises from the destruction of the seven **Prakṛtis** is called **Kṣāyika Samyagdṛṣṭi**. This **Samyagdṛṣṭi** is **infinite** in its duration. The **Dṛṣṭi** begins with the destruction of the **Mohaniya Karma** and can occur in the **Karmabhūmi** for humans, **Kevali**, and **Śrutakevali**, but its **perfection** can occur in all four **Gatis**. A being with **Kṣāyika Samyagdṛṣṭi** does not remain in the world for more than **four Bhavas**. This **Samyaktva** is found from the **fourth Guṇasthāna** to the **fourteenth Guṇasthāna**, and also in the **Siddh Parameṣṭhī**. 251. Question: What is **Miśra Samyaktva**? Answer: When the **Samyagmithyātvā Prakṛti** arises, it produces results that are neither **Samyaktva** nor **Mithyātvā**, meaning the being has **belief** and **disbelief** regarding the **Tattva**. This is called **Miśra Samyaktva**. This occurs only in the **third Guṇasthāna**. (131) 

Page #137:
---------------------------
252. Question: What is Saasadan Samyaktv? Answer: When at least one and at most six Avali Praman Kal remain during the time of Prathamopa Sham Samyaktv, and the arising of any one of the Anantanu bandhi nature of Krodh-Man-Maya-Lom, which has contradicted Samyaktv, but has not attained Mithyatv, those Saasadan form results are called Saasadan Samyaktv. This state remains only in the second Gunasthan. This Jiva, by rule, attains the Mithyatv state. 253. Question: What is Mithyatv? Answer: The Jiva who does not have faith in the words of Jinendradev, Aapt, Aagam, Padarth, but due to the arising of Mithyatv nature, has faith in the opposite of Padarth, whether said by a wrong Guru or not, is called Mithyatv. This is the state of the first Gunasthan. 254. Question: How many types of Sanjni Margana are there and what is their nature? Answer: There are two types of Sanjni Margana: (1) Sanjni and (2) Asanji. From the Kshayopa Sham of No Indriya Avaran Karma, the Jiva who has Shiksha (taking benefit, abandoning harm), Kriya (willingly 

Page #138:
---------------------------
One who receives (like the ability to move hands and feet), teachings and discourse (like the recitation of verses) through the dependence of the mind is called **sanjñi**. Those beings in whom the mind is not found in the form of **labdhi** or **upayoga** are called **asanjñi**. From **ekendriya** to **charendriya**, beings are generally **asanjñi**. **Panchendriya** beings are of both **sanjñi** and **asanjñi** types. In **naraka**, **manushya**, and **devagati**, all beings are **sanjñi**, but in **tithyancha** **gati**, both **sanjñi** and **asanjñi** exist. The **asanjñi** being has only the **mithyatva** **gunasthan**, while the **sanjñi** being has **mithyatva** to twelve **gunasthanas**. The beings of the thirteenth and subsequent **gunasthanas** are neither **sanjñi** nor **asanjñi**, but are devoid of both designations. 255. Question: How many types of **aaharaka** **margana** are there? Answer: There are two types of **aaharaka** **margana**: (1) **aaharaka** and (2) **anaaharaka**. 256. Question: What is **aaharaka**? Answer: The **pudgala** **vargana** suitable for the three bodies (**oudarika**, etc.) and six **paryaptis** is called **aahar**. The one who receives it is called **aaharaka**. (133) 

Page #139:
---------------------------
257. Question: What is an *Anaharak*?
Answer: One who does not consume the aforementioned food is called an *Anaharak*.

258. Question: In which *Gunasthanas* are the states of *Aharak* and *Anaharak* found?
Answer: The four *Gati* related beings who attain *Vigraha Gati*, the *Pratar* and the *Lokapurana* *Samudghāt* making *Sayogkevali*, *Ayogkevali* and all *Siddh* beings are *Anaharak*. That is, in the first, second and fourth, in the thirteenth and fourteenth *Gunasthanas* in comparison to *Samudghāt*, and from the beginning to the thirteenth *Gunasthanas* there is the state of *Aharak*. The *utkrista* time of *Aharak* is the *asankhyātava* part of the *suchyangula* (for so long a time the being is born from *rijugati*). And the *jghanya* time is the eighteenth part of three *samaya* less than a breath. The *utkrista* time of *Anaharak* is three *samaya* and the *jghanya* time is one *samaya*.

256. Question: What is *Upayog*?
Answer: The feeling of the being that is inclined to take in an object is called *Upayog*.

260. Question: How many types of usage are there and what is their nature?
Answer: There are two types of usage - (1) Sakar usage and (2) Aakar usage. There are eight types of Sakar usage - five types of Samyakgyan and three types of Agyan. There are four types of Aakar usage - (1) Chakshudarshan (2) Achakshudarshan, (3) Avadhidarshan and (4) Kevaldarshan. Mati, Shruta, Avadhi and Manahparyaya, by which there is special knowledge of their respective subjects until the end of the Antarmuhurt Kala, is called Sakar usage. This transformation of consciousness in the form of perception of an object can only remain for the maximum Antarmuhurt Kala of the Chham-sth Jiva. The general perception of substances by the senses, mind and Avadhi until the Antarmuhurt Kala is called Aakar usage. Aakar usage occurs for the maximum Antarmuhurt Kala of the Chhadm-sth Jiva. 261. Question: Which Margna has which Samyakdarshan?
Answer: In the Gati Margna, in the first Earth-bound Narakio of the Af-o Narak Gati, in the insufficient state of the Kshayik and Kritakritavedek, 
(130 

Page #141:
---------------------------
In the state of *kshayopashmik* and *paryapt* (sufficient), there are three *samyagdarshan* (right faith): *aupashamik*, *kshayik*, and *kshayopashmik*. In the *dvitiya* (second) and subsequent *prithvisth* (earth-bound) *naraki* (hell beings), there is not a single *samyagdarshan* in the *aparyapt* (insufficient) state, and in the *paryapt* state, there are two *samyagdarshan*: *aupashamik* and *kshayopashmik*. In the *tiyanch* (heavenly) realm, in the *aparyapt* state of *bhogabhumij* (enjoyment-bound) *tiyanch*, there are two *samyagdarshan*: *kshayik* and *kshayopashmik*, compared to *kritkritya-vedak* (those who have performed their actions). In the *paryapt* state, all three *samyagdarshan* are present. In the *manushya* (human) realm, in the *aparyapt* state of *manushya*, there are two *samyagdarshan*: *kshayik* and *kshayopashmik*, compared to *kritkritya-vedak*.

In the *vaimanik* (aerial) *dev* realm, in both the *aparyapt* and *paryapt* states, all three types of *samyagdarshan* are present.

With respect to *indriya* (sense organ) *margana* (destruction), from *ekendriya* (one-sense) to *chaturindriya* (four-sense) beings, there is not a single *samyagdarshan*, but in *panchendriya* (five-sense) beings, all three *samyagdarshan* are present. With respect to *kaya* (body) *margana*, in the five *sthavar* (stationary) beings, there is not a single *sampad* (wealth), and in *tras* (mobile) beings, all three *samyaktva* are present.

There are thirteen Gunasthanas. A fourteenth Gunasthan is present only in the case of a Leshyarahit Jiva. All Gunasthanas are present in a Bhavya Jiva, as opposed to only one Mithyatva Gunasthan in an Abhavya Jiva. In the case of Samyaktvamargna, there are four Gunasthanas from the fourth to the seventh in Prathamopahsam Samyaktv and Kshayopahsam Samyaktv, eight Gunasthanas from the fourth to the eleventh in Dvitiyopahsam Samyaktv, and eleven Gunasthanas from the fourth to the fourteenth in Kshayik Samyaktv. Kshayik Samyaktv Gunasthan is also present in the Siddha Parameshti, who is beyond Gunasthanas. In the case of Sanjimargna, the first twelve Gunasthanas are present in Sanji Jivas, one Mithyatva Gunasthan is present in Asanji Jivas, and the last two Gunasthanas are present in Kevali, who is devoid of the behavior of Sanji and Asanji.

1. It is noteworthy that many Acharyas have considered the Sasadan Gunasthan to be present in Asanji Jivas in the Nityaparyapt state. Thus, they have considered two Gunasthanas in Asanji Jivas. Go.k. 113, Panchasangrah p. 75 (Amitagati Acharya) etc. Thus, there are two opinions regarding the presence of Sasadan Gunasthan in Asanji Jivas.
