Request.

It has been more than a year since the accurate Ratnakaranḍa was printed and prepared; but the writing of its preface and the history of Swami Samantabhadra took more time than expected, and for this reason it has been delayed from being published so far. I hope that the well-wishers and readers of the Granthamala, when they read its detailed preface and the history of Swami Samantabhadra, will forget this fault due to delay, and they will also be very happy to read it.

The efforts made by the friendly Babu Jugalkishorji in writing the preface and history cannot be praised. Only history scholars and learned scholars will understand their value. In my opinion, among all the critical and investigative articles written about Jain literature in modern times, these two essays (preface and history) should be given the top position. The conductors of the Granthamala are very grateful to Babu Sahib for these essays. They are also proud to be able to publish these valuable essays along with this book.

The accurate Ratnakaranḍa was edited based on the following three handwritten copies:
a- The copy of the Terapanthi temple in Bombay, which was written recently.
b- The copy written by Pandit Vasudev Neminath Upadhyay of Baramati himself.
c- The copy obtained by Shriman Seth Hirachand Nemichandji Sholapur. Many thanks to the owners of the handwritten copies.

A learned scholar prepared the press copy of this book and a Nyayatiirtha Pandit corrected the proofs; yet it is sad that the book was printed very inaccurately - the Panditji did not care at all about his responsibility. I did not know that the Jinavani-Prakashan, which is considered to be a very reliable printing press, would print such a book so carelessly.

---------------------------
In this sacred work, even with sufficient diligence, such negligence can be committed by scholars. - I am very grateful to the benevolent Pandit Kallappa Bharmappa Nitave, the owner of Jainendra Press, Kolhapur, who drew my attention to these inaccuracies and also sent a corrigendum with great effort, the essential part of which has been given at the end of the book. Due to fear of expansion, ordinary inaccuracies had to be left out. I have been ill for two and a half months. This request has been written while I am still ill. The proofreading of the preface, etc., was also done in this state. Therefore, many errors may have remained. I apologize to the readers for them.

## Introduction.
## Introduction to the Text.

The text whose introduction is presented before the readers today is a well-known text of the Jain community, called 'Ratnakarandaka', a study of devotional practices, which is also commonly known as 'Ratnakarandashravakaachar'. There is perhaps no repository of Jain scriptures that does not contain at least one copy of this text; and from this, one can get a good sense of the text's fame, utility, and respect. - Although this text has been published many times in its original form, as well as in translations in Hindi, Marathi, and English, this is the first time it is being published with its own Sanskrit commentary and a special introduction to the text and its author. And from this perspective, this edition of the text will surely prove to be particularly useful, there is no doubt. - The original text was composed by Swami Samantabhadracharya, whose special introduction or history has been written separately and is being published along with this introduction. This text, targeting the Shravakas, preaches the appropriate Dharma that destroys karma and, by removing worldly beings from the sorrows of the world, establishes them in the highest happiness. That Dharma is in the form of Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana, and Samyakcharitra, and is to be worshipped in this order. The state of Darshan etc. that is contrary to this - that is, not in the Samyak form but in the Mithya form - is Adharma and is the cause of worldly wandering, as the Acharya has stated.

---------------------------
This text describes the three limbs of religion (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct) - the Ratna Tray - in some detail and divides it into seven chapters. A brief summary of each chapter is as follows:

The first chapter explains 'right faith' for those who have faith, free from the three confusions and eight defects, and possess the eight limbs. It describes the characteristics of the enlightened, the scriptures, and the ascetics, the nature of worldly, divine, and heretical confusions, the names of the eight defects, and the important characteristics of the eight limbs. It also shows how the teachings of the enlightened cannot be beneficial without detachment, how right faith without the limbs is not capable of destroying birth and rebirth, and how disrespecting other righteous souls is disrespecting religion itself. In addition, it describes the glory of right faith in detail and mentions the following characteristics:

(1) Even a Chandala with right faith should be considered a 'dev'.
(2) A pure right faith soul does not bow or show humility to false gods, false scriptures, or false teachers due to fear, hope, affection, or greed.
(3) Right faith is primarily worthy of worship compared to knowledge and conduct. It is like a ferryman on the path to liberation, and without it, the origin, existence, growth, and fruition of knowledge and conduct cannot happen in the same way that a tree cannot grow without a seed.
(4) A detached (right faith) householder is on the path to liberation, but a deluded (wrong faith) monk is not. Therefore, a detached householder is superior to a deluded monk.

1. This printed commentary has five chapters of the text, the reason for which is not clear. It is not known whether the commentator Shri Prabhachandra did this or whether it is the work of the scribes. In our opinion, seven chapters seem good from the point of view of subject division, and they are also found in the original manuscripts. If there are not seven chapters, then there should be four. It is not clear what is the point of including the chapter on good vows in the previous chapter and not including the chapter on education vows.

(5)  A soul purified by right faith, even if it is not a renunciant, does not take birth in hell, animal, neuter, or female forms, nor is it born in a low family, nor is it deformed or short-lived, nor does it experience poverty.
In the second chapter, the characteristics of right knowledge are given, and the general nature of the first, second, third, and fourth stages of knowledge (Prathamānuyoga, Karaṇānuyoga, Caraṇānuyoga, and Dravyānuyoga) is described.
In the third chapter, the eligibility and necessity of observing right conduct are described, and it is explained as abstinence from the five vices: violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment.  Further, two types of conduct are described: "complete" and "partial."  It is stated that complete conduct is observed by all renunciants, while partial conduct is observed by householders.  Twelve types of partial conduct suitable for householders are described, including five minor vows, three major vows, and four disciplines.  Then, the renunciation of the five vices in their gross form is explained as the "minor vows," and the nature of the five minor vows is described along with their five transgressions each.  It is also stated that these five minor vows, along with the renunciation of alcohol, meat, and honey, are called the "eight fundamental virtues" for householders.
In the fourth chapter, three major vows are described: the vow of direction (Digvrat), the vow of non-harmful conduct (Anarthadandavrat), and the vow of limited enjoyment (Bhogopbhogparimāṇa), along with their five transgressions each.  Five types of non-harmful conduct are described: harmful advice, violence, negligence, listening to harmful things, and careless conduct.  The nature of limited enjoyment is explained, and some specific renunciations, the characteristics of vows, and the nature of restraints are also given.
In the fifth chapter, four disciplines are described: the discipline of time and space (Deshāvākāśika), the discipline of self-reflection (Sāmāyika), the discipline of fasting (Proṣadhopavās), and the discipline of renunciation (Vaiyāvṛtya), along with their five transgressions each.  Some specific duties are also mentioned in the descriptions of self-reflection and fasting.  Householders observing self-reflection are compared to "monks who are close to their disciples."  Renunciants are also instructed to give charity and to worship the Supreme Lord.  Four types of charity are described: food, medicine, tools, and shelter.
In the sixth chapter, the nature of Sallekhana (death by self-starvation) is explained, along with its necessity, and the instructions for the state of preparation for it.  In brief, Sallekhana is a state of... 

Page #8:
---------------------------
The text mentions the rites of death and the five transgressions of Sallekhana. Finally, it describes the fruits of the right path and provides a glimpse into the nature of supreme happiness.

The seventh chapter describes the nature of the eleven stages of a lay follower, also called "pratima," where the qualities of each subsequent stage encompass all the qualities of the previous stages, thus progressively increasing. The sixth stage is described as "giving up night meals."

This text presents a very engaging, appropriate, happiness-inducing, and authentic description of the practices suitable for lay followers. Therefore, every householder, whether male or female, should definitely study and contemplate this text thoroughly. Acting in accordance with it undoubtedly leads to well-being and is capable of greatly elevating and liberating the soul. The language of the text is also very sweet, mature, and imbued with the weight of meaning. Truly, this text is a small treasure chest of religious gems, and therefore its name "Ratnakarandaka" seems very meaningful.

Although the author himself has described this text as a small treasure chest (karandaka), no other text on the conduct of lay followers has been found so far that is larger and also more ancient than this. A separate and independent text on the subject may have existed before this, but it has not been found.

* In "Charitra Pahuḍ" by Shri Kundakunda Acharya, there are a total of five verses that expound on the restrained conduct of lay followers, which only mention the names of the 11 pratima and 12 vows - their nature and other details are not given, nor are the transgressions of the vows mentioned. In "Tattvartha Sutra" by Umasvati Maharaj, the transgressions of the vows are given, but there is a lack of descriptions of the characteristics of the vows, the types of punishments for wrongdoing, etc. The descriptions of non-violence, truthfulness, etc. are not written specifically for lay followers. The nature and method of Sallekhana are also not mentioned. It lacks the mention of the 11 pratima and many other things, and thus it also presents a very brief description of the conduct of lay followers. 

Page #9:
---------------------------
None are available. The famous texts like *Purushartha Siddhi Upay*, *Charitra Sara*, *Somadev Upasaka Adhyayan*, *Amitagati Upasaka Achar*, *Vasunandi Shravaka Achar*, *Sagara Dharma Amrit*, and *Lati Samhita* etc. were all composed after this one.
And therefore, if this text is called 'Pratham Shravaka Achar' in the available Jain literature, perhaps nothing would be inappropriate. Even though it is small, the collection of Dharma Ratnas with the characteristics of Shravakas that are contained in it are certainly very valuable. And therefore, even though this text is small in size, it is big in value, we have no hesitation in saying so. Prabhachandraji has written it as the pure sun that illuminates the entire Sagara Marg (Grihastha Dharma) and Shri Vadiraj Suri has remembered it with the epithet 'Akshayya Sukhavaha'.
Doubt about the text. Some people think that this text was not written by Swami Samantabhadracharya, who became a very famous scholar in the Jain community
and who composed unique and unprecedented logical and philosophical texts like 'Devagam' (Aapta Mimamsa). Rather, it was written by another scholar named 'Samantabhadra' or by someone else in the name of Samantabhadra, and therefore it is not very ancient. But what is the reason for their opinion or doubt and on what basis does it stand, no clear mention has been made by them in any letter etc. so far, so that a proper answer can be given to it. Nevertheless, to remove this vain doubt, to erase its possibility and to prevent its progeny from going forward in the future, it seems appropriate to mention some evidence here and a little effort is made below
(1) Historical review reveals that there were two or four other scholars named *Samantabhadra*; but none of them were adorned with the title 'Swami' or distinguished by this epithet; rather, one is called by the name Laghusamantabhadra, who wrote a commentary (commentary) called 'Vishama Padataatparya Teeka' on Ashta Sahasri. These scholars themselves reveal themselves as 'Laghusamantabhadra'. 

Page #10:
---------------------------
As I bow down to the pure, knowledge-filled Lord, my master, with my own devotion, I, the small Samantabhadra, will explain the eight thousand verses. . . . The second is called "Cikk Samantabhadra." The book mentioned in the list of the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan in Ara, under the name "Cikk Samantabhadra Stotra," is said to have been written by him. Upon examining it, it was found to be the same hymn that was published in the fourth ray of the "Jain Siddhanta Bhaskar" under the name "An Historical Hymn," and whose last verse gives the name of its author as "Maghanandi-vrati." From this, it appears that Cikk Samantabhadra is simply another name for Maghanandi. We have learned the same from a Kannada scholar from the Karnataka region. Varni Nemisagarji also informs us in one of his letters that "this name, 'Cikk Samantabhadra' or 'Lahu Samantabhadra,' is common here (in the south) for this Maghanandi." The word "Cikk" also means small or little. It is not surprising that the aforementioned Lahu Samantabhadra and this Cikk Samantabhadra are the same person, and that he is also called Maghanandi-vrati. A scholar named Maghanandi-vrati was a disciple of Acharya Amarakirti, and the first and last verses of the aforementioned historical hymn use the word "Amar" prominently. This suggests that he was possibly the Maghanandi-vrati who was a disciple of Acharya Amarakirti, and that he also remembered his guru in this hymn by using the word "Amar." If this is correct, then this Maghanandi-vrati or Cikk Samantabhadra should be considered a scholar of the fourteenth century Vikram era; because Maghanandi-vrati's disciple and Amarakirti's disciple, Bhogaraj, installed a statue of Shantinath Jineswar in Shaka Samvat 1277 (Vikram Samvat 1402), which is now in the office of the Raidugra Taluk, as is evident from the inscription on the statue. *
The third was Samantabhadra of Gerusoppe, who is mentioned in the Taluk Kopp, district Kadur.
* See "South Indian Jainism," Part Two, page 57.
x This is a special place in South India, also known as Kshemapur, which is described in detail in the 55th stone inscription of Sagar Taluk. Famous 

Page #11:
---------------------------
These are found in four copper plates that are associated with Jain settlements. These copper plates mention 'Gerusoppe-Samantabhadra-deva'. The first copper plate is dated to Saka Samvat 1355, which is from your own time. The rest are related to the time of your disciple, or the disciple of your disciple Gunabhadra, Vira Sena.

The fourth one was named 'Abhinava Samantabhadra'. A pillar of bronze was erected in front of the Nemishvara Chaityalaya, which was built by the Yojana-Shresthika, due to the teachings of this Abhinava Samantabhadra Muni. This is mentioned in inscription number 55 in the Sagar Taluk of the Shimoga district. This inscription is from the time of King Devaraya of the Tula, Konkan, and other countries. Therefore, Mr. Lewis Rice has dated it to around 1560 AD. This makes it clear when Abhinava Samantabhadra was a scholar.

The fifth one was a Samantabhadra Bhattaraka. In the Senagana Pattavali, published by Jain Siddhanta Bhaskara, he is mentioned as being established on the Patta of Jinesena Bhattaraka, who was the Patta disciple of Abhinava Somesena Bhattaraka. It is also mentioned that this Abhinava Somesena was the Patta disciple of Gunabhadra Bhattaraka. A book called Dharmarasika, a Trivarnachar (Trivarnaachar), was written by Somesena Bhattaraka, the Patta disciple of Gunabhadra Bhattaraka. This book is well-known and has been printed. Therefore, there is no hesitation in saying that this Samantabhadra Bhattaraka was the Prapatta disciple of the same Somesena Bhattaraka who wrote the Trivarnachar. This Trivarnachar of Somesena was completed in Vikram Samvat 1667. Therefore, this Samantabhadra Bhattaraka should be considered a scholar of the latter part of the 17th century Vikram. 'Gerusoppe-Prapaat' (Waterfall) is also named after this place. See E.C., VIII. Introduction. The first copper plate, number 21, mentions 'Gerusoppey'. * See, Volume 6 of 'Epigraphia Carnatica', printed in 1901, inscription numbers 21, 22, 23, 24 in Kopp Taluk.
4 See, 'Epigraphia Carnatica', Volume 8.

---------------------------
The sixth 'Grihastha Samantabhadra' lived around the 17th century Vikram era. He was the nephew of Grihasthacharya Nemichandra, who authored the treatise 'Pratiṣṭhātilak', also known as 'Nemichandra Samhita' or 'Nemichandra Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha', which was introduced in the Jain Hitaishi of April 1916. This treatise mentions Samantabhadra as a lover of literature and states that he was among those who requested Nemichandra to write the aforementioned treatise. It is possible that the treatise 'Pūjāvidhi', listed in the 'Digambar Jain Granthakarta aur Unke Granth', was written by him.

(2) The name of Acharya Samantabhadra, the author of Ratnakaraṇḍaka, is not accompanied by the words 'Laghu', 'Chikk', 'Gerusoppé', 'Abhinava', or 'Bhaṭṭāraka', nor is another name of his, 'Māghanandī', mentioned anywhere in the treatise. Rather, throughout the treatise, including the commentary, his name is accompanied by the word 'Swami', a title that was particularly bestowed upon the author of 'Devāgama' and signifies his great prestige and extraordinary importance. Great Acharyas and scholars have often remembered him with this (Swami) epithet, and it seems so ingrained with Bhagavan Samantabhadra that it has become almost a part of his name. This is why many great scholars and Acharyas, in numerous places, have mentioned him only by using the term 'Swami' instead of his name. This clearly indicates the immense fame of Acharya Mahādeva as 'Swami'.

* See - Vādirāja's Pārśvanāthacarita's verse no. 17, 'Swaminaschariṭam tasya' etc.; Paṇḍit Āśādhara's Sāgāradharmāmṛta and Anāgāradharmāmṛta commentaries' 'Swamyuktaṣṭamūlaguṇapakshe, Itiswāmimaten darshaniko bhaveṭ, Swāmimatenatvime (aticārāḥ), Atraha Swāmī yathā, tatha cha Swāmisūktāni' etc. verses; Nyāyadīpikā's 'Taduṭam Swāmibhireva' statement with the inclusion of two Kārikās from Devāgama and numerous verses and statements from Śrīvidyānandācārya's Aṣṭasahasrī etc. treatises. 

Page #13:
---------------------------
In this situation, this text does not appear to be written by a disciple of Samantabhadra, but rather by Samantabhadra Swami himself, who was the author of the 'Devagam' - an authoritative text on Jainism.

(3) The Kannada text 'Rajavali Kathe' also mentions Samantabhadra Swami as the author of 'Ratnakarandaka' and other texts while narrating his story. For example:

"The great Samantabhadra Swami, who performed severe austerities, attained the fourfold liberation by himself and composed the Ratnakarandaka and other Jain Agamas and Puranas. He was a master of logic and debate and attained Samadhi." - (4)

In the 13th century, the scholar Ashādhara, in his commentaries on 'Anāgāra Dharmamr̥ta' and 'Sāgāra Dharmamr̥ta' (Bhavyakumudachandrika), quotes several verses from the Ratnakarandaka, mentioning Samantabhadra Swami by his full name or simply as 'Swami'. These verses are found in the first chapter of the Ratnakarandaka, verses 5, 22, 23, 24, 30, in the third chapter, verses 16, 20, 44, and in the fifth chapter, verses 7, 16, 20. He also quotes some verses without mentioning the name, which are found in the first chapter, verses 14, 21, 32, 41. He quotes these verses as evidence to support his arguments or to demonstrate the specific views of Samantabhadra Swami. In his commentary on the 16th verse of 'Anāgāra Dharmamr̥ta', while discussing the definition of an 'Āpta' (authoritative person), he quotes verse 5, "Āpto notsannadoṣeṇa" (An authoritative person is one who is free from all defects), as a statement from the Agamas and attributes it to Samantabhadra Swami. ... For example:

"It is known and certain. Who is that? He is the supreme Āpta... Why? Because of the Agamas." "An Āpta is free from all defects, omniscient, and the author of the Agamas. It is necessary to follow his teachings, there is no other way to attain Āptatā."

* Prabhāchandrachārya, in his commentary, divides this text into five chapters, but the original text published in the Sanātana Granthamālā and other sources has seven chapters. According to this, the 7th verse belongs to the sixth chapter, and the remaining two verses belong to the seventh chapter (verses 2 and 6). 

Page #14:
---------------------------
"And so on." From what is it distinguished? From the teachings of the *Shiṣṭas* and those who were taught by them. The *Shiṣṭas* are those who have attained special knowledge from the *Āptas* (inspired ones), such as *Svāmī Samantabhadra* and others. The teachings are those that were passed down by them through the lineage of teachers.

This mention also makes it clear that the learned *Āśādhara* has presented the *Ratnakaraṇḍaka*, a study of *Upāsaka* (lay devotee) practices, as an *Āgama* text.

In one place, while deciding on matters of ignorance, you have quoted verse number 30 from the *Ratnakaraṇḍaka*, "From fear, hope, affection, and greed, etc." along with the phrase, "How else could this *Svāmī* sūkta be justified?" and then concluded that *Ṭhakkura* (Amṛtacandracārya) has also declared the verse "In the world, the appearance of scriptures," etc. (which is verse number 26 of the *Purṣārtha Siddhi Upāya*) in accordance with this *Svāmī* sūkta.

As follows: "Following this very thing, *Ṭhakkura* also recited this:

In the world, the appearance of scriptures, in the appearance of time, and in the appearance of deities. It is always the duty of one with a taste for the truth to be free from the view of the ignorant.

From this mention, it is found that the *Ratnakaraṇḍaka* is the basis of esteemed works like the *Purṣārtha Siddhi Upāya*, and therefore this text is even more ancient and esteemed than that.

(5) *Śrīpadmaprbhamaladhārideva*, in his commentary on the *Nīyamasāra*, has quoted two verses from the *Ratnakaraṇḍaka*, "And it is also said by *Śrī Samantabhadra Svāmī*," and "It is said in the study of *Upāsaka* practices," which are respectively verse number 1 in the second chapter and verse number 4 in the fifth chapter here. The existence of *Padmaprbhamaladhārideva* is found to be around the 12th century Vikram era. From this, it is clear that this text was considered to be composed by *Svāmī Samantabhadra* even eight hundred years ago.

(6) *Śrī Cāmuṇḍarāya*, a scholar of the 11th century Vikram era (first half), has quoted verse number 35 from the *Ratnakaraṇḍaka* in his *Caritra Sāra*, "Those who have pure *Samyagdṛṣṭi*." Not only that, but in many places he has considered the characteristics, etc. of this text to be excellent and has made them a part of his own text, including the words. Two examples of this are as follows: 

Page #15:
---------------------------
One who is pure in **Samyak Darshan**, is disgusted with the body, the world, and its enjoyments, and is a devotee of the five **Gurus**, is a **Darshanik** and understands the path of truth.
- **Ratnakarandaka**

A **Darshanik** is disgusted with the body, the world, and its enjoyments, is a devotee of the five **Gurus**, and is pure in **Samyak Darshan**.
- **Charitra Sara**

In times of epidemics, famine, old age, and incurable diseases, the **Aryas** call **Sallekhana** the liberation of the body for the sake of Dharma.
- **Ratnakarandaka**

In times of epidemics, famine, old age, and incurable diseases, **Sallekhana** is the abandonment of the body for the sake of Dharma.
- **Charitra Sara**

This **Charitra Sara** text is one of the five or seven special and highly respected texts on which Pandit Ashadharji based his **Sagar Dharma Amrit**. Therefore, the **Ratnakarandaka**'s importance, antiquity, and acceptance are further established by the way it is followed in this text.

Many other ancient texts follow this text in various ways, which we are forced to omit here due to the fear of being too lengthy.

(7) The renowned scholar Acharya Shri Vadiraj Suri completed his **Parsvanath Charit** in the Saka year 947. This text clearly indicates that Swami Samantabhadra is the author of both **Devagam** and **Ratnakarandaka**. As it says:

"The story of that Swami (Samantabhadra) is amazing for everyone. He has shown the **Sarvagna** through **Devagam** till today. He is the same **Yogindra** who brought about imperishable happiness. **Ratnakarandaka** was given to the deserving **Bhavya** for the sake of wealth."

That is, the story of that Swami (Samantabhadra) is amazing for everyone, who has shown the **Sarvagna** through **Devagam** till today. He is the same **Yogindra** who brought about imperishable happiness. **Ratnakarandaka** was given to the deserving **Bhavya** for the sake of wealth.

* These texts are: 1. **Ratnakarandaka**, 2. **Upasaka Adhyayan** included in **Yasastilak** by Somadeva, 3. **Charitra Sara**, 4. **Vasunandishravaka Achar**, 5. **Adi Purana** by Shri Jinasena, 6. **Tattvarth Sutra**, etc. 

Page #16:
---------------------------
12
Those yogindras (Samantabhadra) who have given the 'ratnakarandaka' (treasure chest of Dharma gems) which is the source of inexhaustible happiness to the vast assembly of beings, are renunciants (donors).

In the presence of all these evidences, there is no opportunity for such doubts that this text is created by another Samantabhadra, other than Swami Samantabhadra, the author of 'Devagam', or that it is modern. The literature of the text itself does not help in this doubt. It is often so mature, serious, high and systematic, from the point of view of simplicity of the subject, that there is no hesitation in accepting it as the literature of Swami Samantabhadra. There is no statement in the entire text that contradicts any other text of the Acharya, or that is contrary to Jain principles, and for which someone had to take refuge in Lord Samantabhadra. In such a situation and in the light of the above evidence, it cannot even be imagined that in such a distant past - more than a thousand years ago, someone created this text in the name of Swami Samantabhadra without any reason, and since then, till now, in the presence of so much daily introduction of the text and in the hands of good and experienced scholars and Acharyas, no one has noticed it. Therefore, this entire doubt about the author of the text seems to be baseless.

As far as we understand and have also come to know, there is only one reason for this doubt of the people and that is that the text does not have the 'logic' that is found in other argumentative texts of Samantabhadra, in which many controversial topics have been discussed - Doubters wanted to see this text also colored in the same color in which they are seeing Devagamadi, because of its creation by Samantabhadra. But this is their big mistake and deep delusion. It seems that they have not observed Jain literature on Shravakachar chronologically or historically, nor have they considered the contemporary situation of the country and society. If this had been the case, they would have known that at that time - during the time of Swami Samantabhadra - and even before that, Shravak people were mostly inclined towards the Sadhumukha side. They did not decide their path by studying the texts independently; rather, the Sadhus and Munis were the ones who, at that time, were engaged in Dharma. They needed to do so. 

Page #17:
---------------------------
13
There was only one guide. At that time, there was a great abundance of monks in the country, and they were almost always in constant communion. This led householders to go to them for religious instruction, and after listening to the explanation of religion, they would ask them for some vow, a particular vow, or a group of vows for themselves. The holy men also instructed the lay followers in their proper duties, and if they considered their requested vow to be appropriate, they would initiate them with a guru mantra. If they did not find it suitable for their strength and situation, they would forbid it. At the same time, they would regulate the rules and regulations of the vow, etc., according to their ability. In this way, the lay followers understood that the religious practices they received from the teachings of the gurus were their religion, their duty, and their actions. They did not know how to "quibble" (whether, how, etc.), or rather, their faith and devotion did not allow them to go in that direction (towards the path of doubt). Among the lay followers, the reign of obedience was established everywhere, and because of this tendency and its consequences, they were called "Shravaka" and "Shraddha." Until then, there was hardly any entry of logic into the Shravaka Dharma, or the subject of good conduct among the lay followers, nor was there so much difference of opinion among the various Acharyas that it needed to be explained or reconciled.
"
* "Shravaka" is one who listens to the Dharma from the mouth of the Guru, etc. (Sa. Dh. T.) "He who listens to the teachings of the Samyagdarshanas, etc., is called a Shravaka."
Samyagdarshanai Paidiyahm Jaijana Sunei Ya.
Samayareem Paramm Jo Khalu Tam Savagam Binti. - Shravaka Prajnapti.
One who is endowed with Samyagdarshan, etc., and who goes to the monks every day and listens to the supreme Samachari (the special conduct of the holy men and householders) is called a "Shravaka."
X "Shraddha" is one who is endowed with faith, or one who is endowed with the quality of faith. This has been stated by Acharyas like Hemachandra and Shridharasena. Because of their faith in the conduct and thoughts of the monks, their devotees were called "Shraddha."

In order to argue for something, one needs to rely on logic. Until that time, the use of logic was mostly confined to the principles of one's own religion and controversial topics like the existence of the soul. These were the subjects that were tested by the yardstick of logic, and all efforts were directed towards their examination and decision. Therefore, the logical texts found from that time are mostly about these topics. Where there is no debate, there is no need for logic. This is why texts on subjects like poetry, rhetoric, literature, lexicography, grammar, medicine, astrology, etc., are mostly devoid of logic. Even Swami Samantabhadra's own work, the *Jinshataka*, falls into this category. Despite being written by the Swami, it does not have the same logical depth as the *Devagama*. It is a difficult, ornate text, and it reveals the author's unparalleled poetic skill, extraordinary grammatical knowledge, and unique mastery of language. The *Ratnakarandaka* is also one of those texts that are not primarily logical, and therefore, its lack of logic cannot be a cause for doubt. There is no rule that compels an author to follow the same method throughout all their works. Texts on various subjects are written for different types of students, and due to the diversity of subject matter and student interests, the writing style often varies. It is another matter that their literature shares many similarities in terms of maturity, skill in presentation, and word arrangement, and the *Ratnakarandaka* is not devoid of these similarities.

It seems appropriate to mention here that Mr. B. Lewis Rice, in the introduction to his book *Inscriptions at Sravana Belgola*, quotes the seven verses from the *Ratnakarandaka* beginning with "Upasarge durbhikshe..." and writes that this *Ratnakarandaka* is a work by "Ayit-Varmma." As follows:

The vow in performance of which they thus starved themselves to death is called Sallekhana and the following is the description of it in the Ratnakarandaka, a work by Ayit-Varmma. 

Page #19:
---------------------------
However, there is no mention in the introduction about who Ayitava was, when he lived, or from where or from which place he achieved this name, etc. However, later on, Swami Samantabhadra has also been written as the author of the 'Ratnakarandaka' and it has been told that he composed this book after taking re-initiation.
Although, the name 'Ayitava' seems very unheard of and as far as we have understood Jain literature, we have not found this name anywhere else. Still, it is possible that 'Ayitavarma' like 'Santivarma' is also another name of Samantabhadra's household life or it may have been written mistakenly in place of Santivarma. If this is not the case, then on the basis of the above evidence, we have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Rice's attribution of this book to Ayitavarma is completely wrong and misleading - he must have had some misunderstanding or misinterpretation in making this mention. Otherwise, this book is made by Swami Samantabhadra himself and is famous by his name.
After all this was written, recently we got the opportunity to see the new edition of the said book, which was published in 1923, and we are happy to state that this edition has corrected Mr. Rice's said mistake and clearly by the words 'Ratnakarandaka of Samantabhadra' (Ratna Karandaka of Samantabhadra) has accepted the 'Ratnakarandaka' as the book of Samantabhadra.
Examination of the verses of the book. There are some scholars in society who do accept this book as written by Swami Samantabhadra, but they have doubts about some of the verses of this book. In their opinion, some verses are found in the book which are not part of the original book but are verses from some other book or books and later on some 

Page #20:
---------------------------
These verses have been included in the text. Such verses are called 'Kshepak' or 'Prakshipt' by people and therefore this is another type of doubt about the text which needs to be considered here.
This type of doubt about the text was first documented by Pt. Pannalalji Bakliwal in 1898 AD. In this year, he prepared the Ratnakaranḍaśrāvakācāra with Anvaya and Anvayānugata Hindi translation and published it through 'Digambar Jain Pustakalaya-Wardha'. In this edition of the text, 21 verses have been identified as 'Kshepak' or there is doubt about them being 'Kshepak', the list of which, with some initials, is as follows:
Tavadanjan; Tatojinendra; Yadi Pap; Shvapidevo; Bhayashasneh; Matago Dhanashri; Madyamams; Pratyakhyan; Yadnishtan; Vyapar; Shrishen, Devadhidev; Arhacharan; Nishreyas; Janmajara; Vidyadarshan; Kalekalp; Nishreyasamādhipannā; Pujārtha; Sukhayatu.
The reasons for some of these verses being 'Kshepak' have also been mentioned in footnotes, which are as follows:
'Tavadanjan' and 'Tatojinendra' both these verses are not by Samantabhadra; but it is not mentioned that these verses are from some other Acharya or text. Third, the verse 'Yadi Pap' does not have any connection with the subject of the text. The verses named 'Shvapidevo', 'Bhayasha' and 'Yadnishtan' do not have proper connection, Anvaya and meaning. 'Shrishen', 'Devadhidev' and 'Arhacharan' these verses do not have any connection with the place of the text. The Anvaya and subject matter of the 6 verses from the fifteenth 'Nishreyas' to the twentieth 'Pujārtha' do not appear properly and the eleventh verse 'Vyapar' is an 'Anabhijna Kshepak' - that is, this verse has been included in the text due to foolishness or ignorance. Because first, its Anvaya does not fit properly; secondly, in the next verse, like other texts, there is a daily Samayik Upadesh and in this verse, there is only an Upadesh to do Samayik on fasting or Ekāsana days, which creates a contradiction between the previous and the next. In connection with this verse, it has also been said emphatically that "Such words of Shrimat Samantabhadra Swami cannot be possible," and the Anvaya and meaning of this verse have not been given. The last 

Page #21:
---------------------------
The verse has probably been considered a similar heavy projectile and therefore its meaning has not been interpreted. Regarding the remaining verses, it has only been stated that they appear or are understood to be 'projectiles'. No reason has been given for their projectile nature. However, the introduction does mention that "the reason for the remaining verses is extensive and therefore has not been published, it may be revealed through a letter or in person."

This is the form of Bakliwalji's immediate doubt. His work has confirmed the doubts of some people and has also instilled new doubts in many hearts. Although, no ancient mention or strong evidence has been found so far in connection with this text, which could confirm that Swami Samantabhadra had created it in such a large number of verses, nor is the same number of verses found in all the copies of the text, but some copies are also available in which the number of verses is more than one hundred and fifty, and there is no doubt that while copying from the annotated copies of the original text, due to the carelessness or ignorance of the writers, sometimes the verses of other texts included in the original text in the form of 'Uktan Cha' or notes written in the margin for support, etc. And from this, many texts have 'projectiles'*. Apart from this, there are definitely some verses in the original text which, if separated from the text, do not hinder the order and subject matter of the remaining verses, nor does it make any difference. Such a situation
_ * For an example of this topic, see our article 'Examination of Pujyapada-Upasakaachar', which was published in issue 12 of Janahitaishi part 15. Recently, a text called 'Dashabhakti' has been published from Sholapur, with Sanskrit commentary and Marathi translation. It appears that many projectiles are being included in the original texts of the Dashabhaktis. This is all the result of the grace of ignorant and careless writers!
* Such as the verses 'Tavadanjan Chaurange', etc., which mention stories. 

Page #22:
---------------------------
It is not unnatural to have doubts about some verses in the text. However, these things cannot be considered as evidence of any 'क्षेपक' (interpolation) in any text.
Therefore, without any deep research and investigation, it cannot be said that the current version of this text (with 150 verses) also contains any 'क्षेपक'. Before declaring any verse of the text as 'क्षेपक', it is very important to investigate whether there is any reason for it, even though the absence of the said verse does not hinder the subject matter of the text in any way.
1. There is another verse from a certain scholar, Acharya or text, and it is not found in the text in the form of 'उक्तं च' (as mentioned).
2. It contradicts another verse or sentence from the author's other text or the same text.
3. It is irrelevant to the subject, context, order of narration or chapter of the text.
4. It is not found in another ancient, pure and unambiguous version of the text.
5. Its literature does not match the literature of the text, the style of narration of the text does not want its existence, or the author is not likely to have made such a statement.
Until any of these reasons are available and until it is not shown that the absence of that verse does not hinder the subject matter of the text in any way, it would be a mere audacity to call any verse a 'क्षेपक'.
Pannalalji Bakliwal has not revealed in relation to any of the verses that he has declared as 'क्षेपक' or suspected of being 'क्षेपक', whether it is a verse from another Acharya, scholar or text, or whether his statement contradicts another verse or sentence from the same or another text written by Swami Samantabhadra; nor has he informed whether it is not found in another ancient, pure and unambiguous version of the Ratnakaranḍaka, or whether its literature does not match the other literature of the text, and not one verse after another 

Page #23:
---------------------------
A discussion has been raised regarding a certain verse, questioning why such a statement could not have been made by Swami Samantabhadra. Consequently, your entire argument falls under the third category of the aforementioned reasons. In other words, Bakliwalji has considered these verses to be unrelated to the original text. Their understanding is that the meaning of some verses does not fit properly, or the subject matter is not clearly understood, and so on. Otherwise, they would also label the verse "Chaturavarttritaya" as "Kshepak" because they did not understand its meaning.

However, in reality, all these verses are not as Bakliwalji has understood them. Upon careful consideration, no significant flaws are found in their meaning or subject matter, and this can be easily determined from the Sanskrit commentary of the text. As an example, we take the same verse that Bakliwalji has labeled "Anabhijnakshepak," and regarding which your opinion seems to have moved from doubt to certainty. You have even dared to say, "Such words could never have been spoken by Swami Samantabhadra." The verse is as follows:

"Vyapaarvaimanasyaadvinivruttiyaamantaaraatmavinivruttiyaa |
Samaayikam baneeyadupavaase chaikabhukte vaa ||"

In this verse, primarily from the perspective of the general public and those who follow the vow, the practice of Samayik on fasting and one-meal days is prescribed. It does not say that Samayik should be performed only on fasting and one-meal days. However, this should not lead anyone to believe that it is prohibited on other days or daily. Therefore, Acharya Mahoray has clarified this in the next verse and written that Samayik should be performed daily (pratidivasampi) with a clear mind. The next verse is as follows:

"Samaayikam pratidivasam yathavad pyanalasen chetavyaam |
Vratapanchaka paripurnakaraanamavadhaanyuktena ||"

In this verse, the word "api" along with "pratidivasam" is particularly noteworthy, and it distinguishes this verse from the previous one, which refers to "pratidivasasaamayik." 

Page #24:
---------------------------
"..
.
.
The second verse demands it. If the first verse is removed from the text, the word 'api' becomes very jarring. Therefore, the said verse is not a *kshepak* and there is no apparent opposition between it and the next verse. To label it an *anabhijnakshepak* is to reveal one's own ignorance. It seems that Bakliwalji's attention did not go to this 'api' word and this is why he did not translate it. Also, the meaning of that *anabhijnakshepak* did not appear clear to him. This is why he unnecessarily imagined the words "and" and "only" in it and had to write that the *anvaya* of this verse is not correct. Otherwise, the *anvaya* of this verse is not difficult at all - by placing 'samayikam baniyat' at the end of the verse, the *anvaya* becomes easy. The *anvaya* and subject matter connection of the other verses are also mostly in the same state. It seems that he did not understand them properly at that time and therefore all his mention of them seems to be filled with mistakes. Recently, upon our inquiry, Bakliwalji, in his letter dated June 18, 1923, has also acknowledged this mistake, which we present below in his own words:
"In the first edition of Ratnakaranḍa, there is no evidence for the five verses that I had declared as *kshepak*. At that time, due to my own shallow intellect, such an assumption was made. After seeing the logical commentary in the Sanskrit commentary, my mind is no longer inclined to believe that they are *kshepak*. It was my very first work, the Sanskrit commentary was not available, so question marks (?) were noted for consideration. So it was my mistake."
Although this was Bakliwalji's mistake at that time, it has led many people into the circle of error, one example of which is Pandit Nana Ramchandraji Nag. You did not doubt that the said 21 verses were *kshepak* from Bakliwalji's said work, but you have completely rejected 15+ verses from them. Out of the said 21 verses, the remaining ones, except for the following six verses, are - *madyamamsa*, *yadnishtan*, *nishreyasa*, *janmajara*, *vidyadarshan*, *kale kalpa*.

For Personal & Private Use Only

Page #25:
---------------------------
The author considered the thirteen verses to be extraneous and included them in the same category as the others. In this way, instead of twenty-one verses, twenty-eight verses were declared 'Kshepak' and completely removed from the first edition of 'Upasakaadhyayan' - which they published with a Marathi translation in Shaka Samvat 1826 (Vikram Samvat 1961).  After this, Nag Saheb further pursued his intellect in the same direction and then, without any basis or evidence, you realized in the darkness that there were more 'Kshepak' in this text that should be removed.  At the same time, it was also realized that some of the removed verses should be re-introduced into the text.  And therefore, last year, in Shaka Samvat 1844 (Vikram Samvat 1979), when you published the second edition of this text, you put your understanding into action, i.e., out of the 28 verses of the first edition, 23 + and 26.  New, in this way, 49 x verses were added.  * The list of those thirteen verses is as follows:
Ojastejo, Ashtagun, Navanidhi, Amarasur, Shivmajar, Ragadvesha, Makraakar, Panchaanam (72), Grihahari, Samvatsar, Samayikam, Grihakarmna, Uccaigotra.  _+ The five verses that were removed from the text in the first edition, considered extraneous, and re-introduced in the second edition are as follows:
Makraakar, Grihahari, Samvatsar, Samayikam, Devadhidev.
+ Of these 26 verses, six are the verses from the Bakaliwalajiva that you did not consider 'Kshepak' at the time of the first edition and whose names have already been given.  The list of the remaining 20 verses is as follows:
Deshayami, Kshutpipatsa, Parameshthi, Anathmarth, Samyagdarshan (28), Darshanam, Grihastho, Na Samyaktva, Mohatimira, Hinsanrita, Sakalam, AlpPhal, Samayike, Shitooshna, Asharan, Chaturaahar, Navpunyaih, Kshitigat, Shravakpadani, Yena Swayam.  x Seth Raoji Sakharam Doshee has given the number of these verses as 58 (fifty-eight) in the 'Jainbodhak' of October 1921, and the serial numbers of the removed verses, from the perspective of the entire text, given by him make the number 59. 

Page #26:
---------------------------
Not given space in the edition. They have been completely banished, considering them as projectiles or things outside the text, and you have not given any reasonable reason for doing so. Yes, it has been informed by the title and preface that this second edition of the text is in accordance with the first edition of the book named 'Jain Dharma Amrit Saar' Part 2 by Pt. Pannalal Bakliwal, which was printed in Nagpur in June 1899 AD. Along with this, it has also been told that only those verses have been left here from that book which were of other Acharyas, the rest of the 100 verses of Bhagavat Samantabhadra have been taken as they are in this edition. But the name of that book is neither 'Upasaka Adhyayan' nor 'Ratnakarand', nor does it have seven parts like this second edition of Nag Sahib, nor are 100 verses of Samantabhadra found in it; rather, it is a collection of books in which some statements on the subject of Shravakaachar from the texts named 'Ratnakarand Shravakaachar' and 'Purushartha Siddhi Upay' have been collected in the form of questions and answers and it has also been given the name 'Prashnottar Shravakaachar'. In it, a total of 86 verses have been quoted from 'Ratnakarand Shravakaachar' as needed. Therefore, it cannot be said that this second edition of Nag Sahib is in accordance with it or published on its basis. It seems that they have put some * on the real matter in front of the public through such things.

Along with this, 25 verses numbered 21, 26, 32, 41, 63, 67, 69, 70, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 83, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 99, 101, 112, and 148 have also been removed, which were not actually removed!! And 15 verses numbered 2, 28, 31, 33, 34, 36, 39, 40, 47, 48, 66, 85, 86, 104, and 149 have not been mentioned in that list! Such wrong and misleading mentions are undoubtedly very regrettable and harmful. The Bombay Provincial Sabha has also probably believed this and mentioned the wrong number 58 in its third proposal of the 21st session. (See 'Jain Bodhak' newspaper of January 1922).
* There are also a couple of things like this which have been left here for fear of increasing the article. 

Page #27:
---------------------------
They want to cast a veil. The truth is, in your understanding, this text appears to be a 'Shataka' text, and therefore you consider 100 verses to be original and the rest to be additions. You expressed this in your letter dated Chaitra Shukla 4, Shaka Samvat 1844, saying, "...this is a Shataka, and 50 verses are additions, 100 verses are original." But this is all just your imagination. You have no evidence to support this, which is being speculated here. However, once, on the occasion of the first edition, in its preface, you mentioned regarding 28 verses extracted from the text that these verses are given in the Kannada etc. copies of the text as 'Uktanch', therefore, not being of Samantabhadracharya but of another Acharya, we did not include them in this book. The words of the preface are as follows: "There are copies of this book in Kannada etc., in which some verses are included as 'Uktanch', these verses are not composed by Samantabhadracharya but by another Acharya, therefore we did not include them in this book." But what is that other copy in Kannada etc. in which those 28 verses are given as 'Uktanch', you, even after some scholars searched, could not tell. And therefore your said mention was found to be false. What was your purpose or motive in creating unnecessary confusion by making such false mentions, only you can understand. But whatever it may be, there is no doubt and we do not hesitate to say that all your actions have been completely thoughtless and highly objectionable. You have also changed the order of some verses, which is also objectionable. From a respectable text, without any strong evidence, 
* Although 49 verses were extracted in the said second edition instead of 50. And 101 were printed, but the preface mentions the printing of 100 verses. It is possible that the last verse 'Papamarati' was mistakenly composed and printed, and due to the lack of sequential numbering on all the verses, it was not noticed. 

Page #28:
---------------------------
It is a great audacity and a grave act of arrogance to discard verses (even if they contain interpolations) based solely on one's own imagination or mere preference, without properly determining whether they contain interpolations or not. Therefore, Nagasaheb's actions are not commendable. While discarding these verses, you did not consider that many of them are found in texts from centuries ago, mentioned under the name of Swami Samantabhadra. You also did not consider that discarding verses like "Shravakpadani Devaih" diminishes the importance and subject matter of other verses. Moreover, there are many commentaries on the Ratnaranḍaka in Sanskrit, Kannada, etc., which contain all these verses in their original form. Therefore, I should have exercised more caution. Indeed, Nagasaheb has made a grave mistake by doing so. However, it is good that you finally realized your mistake and expressed regret for your folly, vowing, "I will not publish any future edition of this text with such deficient verses."

Despite all this, you still have doubts about many verses in the text. In one letter, you even inform us that "many people suspect interpolations, but there is no concrete evidence." This statement clearly indicates that you or your friends have no concrete basis (proof) to label the verses that Nagasaheb has labeled as "interpolations" as such. Therefore, all this is just mere suspicion. However, after reading this preface along with the Sanskrit commentary on the text, it is hoped that your and your friends' doubts will be dispelled to a great extent. This is why this investigation is being undertaken.

A version of the Ratnaranḍaka Shravakachar was also published by the General Secretary of the South Maharashtra Jain Sabha (Professor Anna Saheb Babaji Ladhe), along with a Marathi translation. * See "Jainbodhak," Year 32, Issue 6. We learned this name from a letter from Pandit Nana Ramchandraji Nag. Along with...

Published by 'Bhau Babaji Latthe, Kurundwad'. Although this edition contains the same 150 original verses that are found in this accurate copy presented before the readers, the preface does mention that some of these verses are 'unconnected'. It also states that a Kannada script copy, which he received from Rao Devappa Upadhyay, has 50 more verses, out of which, excluding those verses that clearly appear to be 'interpolations', the remaining 7 verses have been given as an appendix. This information reveals two things - firstly, that there is a copy of this text in Kannada script which contains 200 verses; secondly, that Latthe Sahib also suspects some of these one hundred and fifty verses to be interpolations, which he calls unconnected. Although you have not provided any list of such verses, nor have you presented any specific thoughts regarding interpolations, rather you have left that kind of thought 'unpresented' there - yet, for example, you have pointed to the 27th verse and called it unconnected. That verse is as follows:
If there is no benefit from the cessation of sin, then what is the benefit of wealth?
Or if there is a flow of sin, then what is the benefit of wealth?
This verse may seem somewhat unconnected at a superficial level, but when its deeper meaning is considered in depth and its chain is linked with the meaning of the preceding verses, it does not remain unconnected. In the 25th verse before this, the eight-fold nature of pride is explained, and in the 26th verse, the fault of indulging in that pride is shown, and it is stated that one should not despise those who are righteous, those who are endowed with right vision, etc., by becoming proud of one's family, caste, or wealth, etc. After this, the disputed verse teaches that those who are endowed with wealth, family, etc., should try to overcome their pride in those respective objects, and how and in what way they should do so. It has also been found that the translation work of this edition was also done by the Professor Sahib.
X As - "Even in the 150 verses given as the original text, some appear to be unconnected. For example, see the 27th verse. But this thought is irrelevant here." 

Page #30:
---------------------------
One can be supported by thoughts. A righteous person is one who has stopped sinning - that is, there is no inflow of sin. Conversely, one who is filled with the inflow of sin should be considered a sinner or unrighteous. This verse states that for one who possesses the wealth of righteousness, which is the cessation of sin, or the virtue of merit, worldly possessions like wealth and lineage are nothing - useless. Within them, there is a greater and more unique wealth that will manifest in time, and therefore they are not deserving of scorn. Similarly, for one whose soul is filled with the inflow of sin, worldly possessions are of no use. They will soon be destroyed due to that inflow of sin and will not be able to prevent their descent into hell. It is foolish to be proud of such possessions. Those who understand this entire principle never scorn righteous people who are devoid of worldly possessions. The next two verses also reinforce this sentiment - it is explained that a person who possesses the wealth of right faith, even if they are the son of a Chandala - even if they are extremely low due to their lineage - is not deserving of scorn. They have been called "Devas" by the Ganadharas and other Devas - they have been declared worthy of worship. Their state is like that of a burning coal which, though covered in ash on the outside, still holds fire and light within and is therefore never negligible. A human is a human, even a dog can become a Deva through the power of righteousness - through the greatness of right faith and other virtues - and due to the influence of sin - due to wrong faith and other vices - even a Deva can take birth as a dog. In such a situation, what other wealth is there that humans or worldly beings cannot obtain through the grace of righteousness? None. And therefore, righteous people who are devoid of worldly possessions are never deserving of scorn. Here, in the 29th verse, "anya sampat" and in the 27th verse, "anya sampada" are particularly noteworthy. The use of the adjectives "anya" and "anya" is directed towards those worldly possessions that foolish people are proud of, and whose pride is mentioned in verses 25 and 26. This establishes a good connection between all these verses. Therefore, the aforementioned 27th verse is not irrelevant.

Some scholars believe that there are many interpolated verses in the verses praising Samyakdarshan. In their opinion, either all the verses after the 34th verse, which are for the change of meter, till the end of the chapter, are interpolated, or those verses in which they find repetitions must be interpolated. There is no doubt that the meter has changed from Anushtup to Arya after the 34th verse in the text. But the change of meter is not a guarantee for declaring a verse as interpolated. Often such changes are found in texts. Swami Samantabhadra's 'Jinshatak' and 'Vṛhatsvayambhu Stotra' are good examples of this, where the praise of a particular Tirthankara is not only in a different meter but also in more than one meter. Besides, the meter that has changed here has continued till the end of the text, except for two or three exceptions. The rest of the chapters of the text are mostly composed in the same meter, and therefore this doubt arising from the meter does not seem to have any force. However, the matter of repetitions is definitely worth considering. Although repetition alone does not make a verse interpolated, we do not hesitate to say that there cannot be any unnecessary repetitions in Swami Samantabhadra's compositions. To investigate this matter, we have read these verses many times with great care, but we have not found any repetition in them. Each verse has a new meaning and a new arrangement of words. Each one has a special feature - the subject matter of each one is the greatness or the fruit of Samyakdarshan, even though it is different, and all the verses seem to be composed by one and the same scholar - from one mint. We do not dare to call any one of them or any of them interpolated. We do not know where they have experienced these repetitions. Perhaps they have understood this
and they may also say that 'when it is stated in the 35th verse that a pure Samyakdrishti being does not take birth in the hell, animal, eunuch and female realms, does not go to bad families, and is not disabled, short-lived or poor, then it naturally follows that he takes birth in the human and divine realms, is a male, goes to good families. He also attains a good state of wealth etc. And therefore, human and divine realms

There is no need to give the next two verses as indicators of these states. Even if they were given, there would be no need to give the next two verses. And the 41st verse of the end seems completely unnecessary, it is clearly a repetition - it contains a collection of the meaning of the first four verses - either those four verses should have been given or it would have been enough to give this one verse instead of them.
In this regard, we only think it is appropriate to say that firstly, "there is no need" or "there was no need" and "repetition" are not the same thing, there is a big difference between the two and therefore it is not just a mistake to consider the lack of need as repetition and on that basis to consider the verses as irrelevant. Secondly, the result that emerges from the 35th verse regarding the equivalence of man and god is very general and does not necessarily indicate the specific states mentioned in the next verses. 'A being, even after attaining the equivalence of god, can be born in the Bhavanatrik (Bhavanavasi-Vyantar, among astrologers) and can be an ordinary god in heaven. It is not necessary for him to be the Indra of the gods in heaven. Similarly, a being, even after attaining the equivalence of man, can be born in many lowly and middle-ranking categories, free from the vices of the evil and poverty of mankind. For him, going to the equivalence of man is not a regulator of the fact that he is also a 'Manavatilak' endowed with all those perfections of great lineage and great wealth, etc., which are mentioned in the 36th verse. And it is clear that a man, even after being a Manavatilak endowed with great lineage, etc., even after being adorned with the positions of Narayana, Balabhadra, etc., does not become a Chakravarti or a Tirthankara. Therefore, there was a special need to show those specific states mentioned in the next four verses in order to properly proclaim the greatness of right faith and lineage, and therefore those verses are not irrelevant. Yes, the 41st verse of the end, if it is really a 'collection' - as the commentator has also revealed - is certainly a bit jarring. But in our opinion, it is _ as follows - "Yatpraak pratyekam slokaih samyagdarshanasya phalamuuktam tadarshanadhikarsya samaptou sangrahavrttenopasanhritya pratipadayannah-" 

Page #33:
---------------------------
The *Kora* is not a repetition. The author has a different meaning in it, which is not available in the previous verses. The previous verses mention their own points in parts. They do not explain that the same being, by the greatness of *Samyagdarshan*, can also attain all those states in order - that is, he can attain the positions of *Devendras*, *Chakravartis*, and *Tirthankaras* and go to liberation. It seems that this verse was created to explain this particular point. And therefore, it is not a repetition either.

The situation of the six verses, such as *Nishreyas*, etc., which show the result of *Sallekhana* or *Sadharma*, is also almost the same. They are all the same type of verses and are found to be free from repetitions. The fruits named *Nishreyas* and *Abhyudaya* mentioned in the first verse are explained in the following verses. That is, the second verse gives the nature of *Nishreyas* and the sixth verse gives the nature of *Abhyudaya*, and the remaining verses mention the condition of the men who attain *Nishreyas*. Therefore, there is no repetition in them, nor is there any inconsistency between them.

Similarly, there seems to be no repetition in the three verses named *Kshutpipasa*, *Parameshti Paranjyoti*, and *Anatmarth Vinaraagaih*. They have been given as needed and in their place to explain the nature of the *Aapta*. The first verse explains the nature of the *Aapta* by the predominance of the absence of the defects of hunger, thirst, etc., and there was a need to explain it, because there is a very big difference in the statements of the *Digambara* and *Svetambara* sects regarding the eighteen defects. *Svetambara* brothers also believe in the existence of hunger, thirst, etc., in the *Aapta*, which is not desirable for the *Digambara*. And all these differences are based on their almost doctrinal differences. This verse, by the previous verse, came in the *Utsanna* 
* The names of the eighteen defects accepted by the *Svetambara* sect are as follows: 1 *Veeryantaraya*, 2 *Bhogantaraya*, 3 *Upbhogantaraya*, 4 *Danantaraya*, 5 *Labhantaraya*, 6 *Nidra*, 7 *Bhaya*, 8 *Agnana*, 9 *Jugupsa*, 10 *Hasya*, 11 *Rati*, 12 *Arati*, 13 *Raga*, 14 *Dvesha*, 15 *Avirati*, 16 *Kama*, 17 *Shoka*, 18 *Mithyatva*. (See *Vivekvilas* and *Jainatattvadarsha*.)

The term "dosha" (flaw) clarifies a lot. In the second verse, some specific names of the liberated souls (aptas) are mentioned. It is stated that the liberated souls are also called "Parameshthi, Paranjyoti, Viraag (Vitraag), Vimala, Kriti, Sarvagya, Sarva, and Shaasta." This practice of naming is also found in other ancient texts, one example being the Samadhi Tantra text of Shri Pujyapada Swami, which also contains a verse about the names of the Supreme Soul, "Nirmala: Kevala:" etc. Thus, the third verse addresses the question arising from the nature of the liberated soul: If the Shaasta is Vitraag (free from attachment), then how and for what purpose does he give teachings, and does he have any personal agenda? In this way, all three verses are in line with the subject matter and appear to be essential parts of the text.

Some people find the verse "Trasahatipariharaarth" in the section on the quality of Bhogopabhogparimaana (quantity of enjoyment and consumption) to be problematic. They argue that the verse prescribes the abandonment of alcohol, meat, and honey, which has already been mentioned in the previous verse "Madyamaansamadhuyagaaih," which deals with the eight fundamental qualities. Since their abandonment is already included in the fundamental qualities, why was it necessary to repeat it in the subsequent qualities without mentioning any specific reason? Therefore, this verse appears to be redundant and unnecessary. If it was necessary to give this verse to explain the reason for abandoning meat, etc., it should have been placed right before or after the verse "Madyamaansamadhuyagaaih." That would have been the appropriate place, and then there would have been no possibility of redundancy or other flaws.

From the above statement, it is clear that this verse must have been included for some specific reason, due to its mention of the reasons for abandoning alcohol, etc. Therefore, it cannot be considered redundant or unnecessary. The only question now is why this verse was placed here instead of with the verse on the eight fundamental qualities. In our opinion, the main reason for placing it here seems to be that the previous description of the Bhogopabhogparimaana vow and the nature of "bhog" (enjoyment) in the text naturally raises the question: Should the person observing this vow also limit their consumption of alcohol, meat, etc.? In response, the Acharya (teacher) has used this verse to answer this question. 

Page #35:
---------------------------
It has been stated that 'No, these things do not have a quantity, they are completely forbidden for him.' Along with this, it has also been explained why they are forbidden or to be abandoned. If this verse was not given here, but along with the verse of the Ashtamoolagunas, then another verse with a similar meaning would have to be given here, and in this way, there would be a repetition of one thing in the text or an unnecessary increase in one verse. By giving this verse here, both things are accomplished - the reason for the abandonment of the previously mentioned liquor etc. is also known, and it also becomes clear that this vow-taker does not have a quantity of liquor etc., but rather their complete abandonment. In such a situation, this verse does not seem worthy of being looked at from the point of view of doubt. _ Some people consider the aforementioned verse of Ashtamoolagunas to be a rejection, but they do not have any reason or evidence in support of this. Perhaps they think that the inclusion of Panchaanuvratas in this 'verse' among the fundamental qualities is against other texts, in which the abandonment of five Udumbar fruits is found in place of Anuvratas, and only because of this, they have started to look at this verse from the point of view of doubt. If this is the case, then this is their sheer mistake. According to the circumstances of time and place, the opinions of the Acharyas have differed from each other x. Because of this, no verse can be declared as a rejection. Bhagwan Jinaseen and many other Acharyas have included Anuvratas in the fundamental qualities. Pandit Ashadharji has also mentioned this difference of opinion of Samantabhadra etc. in his Sagardharmamrit and its commentary. In reality, just as it is necessary for the Pancha Mahavrata to be in the fundamental qualities of the fully vowed monks, in the same way, it seems necessary for the Panchaanuvratas to be in the fundamental qualities of the country-vowed Shravaks. Acharya Mahoray has created these fundamental qualities specifically targeting the country-vowed Shravaks. The fundamental qualities of the five Udumbar are generally written targeting children, those who are not vowed, or those who are not accustomed to country-restraint; as is evident from the following statement of Shivkotee Acharya x For this, see our article 'Jain Acharyas' Shaasanabhed', which was published in the 14th issue of Jainhitaishi.

The eight fundamental virtues are associated with the minor vows, which are free from the consumption of alcohol, meat, and honey. They are also present in the five Udumbara fruits and in the Arbhakas.
- Ratnamala.

In such a situation, this verse is also not worthy of being viewed with suspicion. It has been given its proper place after the minor vows. Its absence, or rather, the absence of the mention of the fundamental virtues of the Shravakas in a text dealing with Shravaka conduct, would leave a kind of serious flaw in the text, which could never be expected from authors like Swami Samantabhadra. Therefore, this verse cannot be considered as an interpolation.

Doubtful verse.

Two verses are found in the text that describe the educational vow called Proshdhopavasa:
(1) The Proshdhopavasa fast should be known on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar fortnight. It is the rejection of the four types of food with good intentions.
(2) The Proshdhopavasa fast is the discarding of the four types of food, the single meal, and the beginning of the fast.

The first verse begins the description of the Proshdhopavasa vow and states that "on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar fortnight, the rejection of the four types of food with good intentions or with a good intention should be considered as Proshdhopavasa." This is the definition of the Proshdhopavasa vow. The commentary also indicates this as a definition through the following sentence:
"Now, explaining the definition of the Proshdhopavasa vow, which is an educational vow, we say..."

After this verse, two verses describe the specific duties of the fasting day, and before the transgressions of the vow, the second verse, quoted above as number 2, is given. This verse also describes the definition of Proshdhopavasa. And it repeats the rejection of the same four types of food. It is not clear why this verse has been placed here. Considering the order of the statements, the position of this verse seems somewhat doubtful. The commentator also could not clarify its position. He simply wrote the following while giving this verse:
- 

Page #37:
---------------------------
"Now, describing the characteristics of *proṣadhopavāsa*, I say."  Meaning, now they are describing the characteristics of *proṣadhopavāsa*. But the characteristics of *proṣadhopavāsa* were already described and stated two verses earlier. Why is there a need to describe and state its characteristics again? There is no explanation or solution for this in the commentary. However, if it is said that this verse gives a separate form of *proṣadha* and *upavāsa* - four types of food renunciation are called *upavāsa* and eating once is called *proṣadha* - and in this way it is indicated that *proṣadhopavāsa* is the fast observed on the next day after eating once on the previous day - the renunciation of four types of food - then regarding this, there is only this much to say that firstly, although the first half of the verse may give a separate form of *upavāsa* and *proṣadha*, but this sound does not come from its second half that *proṣadhopavāsa* is the name of the fast observed after *proṣadha*. Its words only mean that the *ārambhācāraṇa* done after *upoṣaṇa* (*upavāsa*) is called *proṣadhopavāsa* - the rest of the imagination of the commentator about the days of *dhāraṇa* and *pāraṇa* seems to be his extra imagination. With this characteristic, even ordinary *upavāsa* become *proṣadhopavāsa*; and in such a situation, the position of this verse becomes even more confusing. Secondly, even if it is assumed that the name of the fast observed after *proṣadha* is *proṣadhopavāsa* and that is what is stated by this verse, then it contradicts the previous statement of Swami Samantabhadra, by which the name of the fast on the festival days is indicated as *proṣadhopavāsa* and in this way the etymology of *proṣadhopavāsa* is given as " *proṣadhe parvadine upavāsa proṣadhopavāsaḥ* ". The word *proṣadha* is synonymous with *parva* and the meaning of *proṣadhopavāsa* is " *proṣadhe upavāsaḥ* ", this is found in the works of all famous scholars like Shri Pujyapada, Akalankadeva, Vidyānanda, Somadeva, etc., two examples of which are given below. " *Proṣadha śabdaḥ parvaparyāyavācī | Śabdādigrahaṇaṃ pratiniṛṛttaussukyāni pañcā- pindriyāṇyupeytya tasminvasantītyupavāsaḥ | Caturvidhahārāparityaaga ityārthaḥ | Proṣadhe upavāsaḥ proṣadhopavāsaḥ |* "
- *Savārthasiddhi*. 

Page #38:
---------------------------

“The word *proṣadha* is synonymous with *parva* (festival), and *proṣadha upavāsa* is fasting during a *proṣadha*.”
— *Tattvārtharāja Vārtika*
-
*Catuvādit* -
“*Proṣadha parvaṇyupavāsaḥ proṣadhopavāsaḥ*.” — *Śloka Vārtika* 1 “*Parvāṇi proṣadhānyāhurmāse caturāri tāni ca*” etc. — *Yaśastilka* | “*Proṣadhaḥ parva paryāyavāci. Parvaṇi caturvidhāhāranivṛttiḥ proṣadhopavāsaḥ*.” - *Cāritrasāra*. “Here, the word *proṣadha* is conventionally used for festivals. Festivals are the eighth lunar days, because of the completion of the *pūrṇimā*.” — *Haribhadra* in his commentary. After much investigation, we have not found any other text that defines *proṣadha* as “single meal” and *proṣadhopavāsa* as “fasting after a single meal.” The fact that *proṣadha* does not mean “single meal” is also evident from the following statement of Śrī Samantabhadra, which is given in this very text later on, to explain the form of the *proṣadhopavāsa* image—
6
*Parvadineṣu caturṣvapi māse māse svaśaktim aniguhya. Proṣadhaniyamividhāyī praṇadhiparaḥ proṣadhānasanaḥ* ||
From this, it becomes clear that the above verse, called “*Caturāhāravīsargāna*,” is also contrary to the later statement of Śrī Samantabhadra. In such a situation, because this verse contradicts the earlier statements of the text, there is much hesitation in accepting it as Śrī Samantabhadra’s. It is not surprising that this verse may have been interpolated into the text before the commentary, and the commentator may not have noticed it.
Now we consider those verses that have become the subject of doubt for most people. These verses are the verses with examples, and their number is six in the text. Of these, the first two verses, “*Tāvadanjana*” and “*Tato Jinendra bhakta*,” give the names of eight individuals who are famous for the eight limbs of right faith, etc. The third verse, “*Mātango Dhandevaśca*,” gives the names of five individuals, indicating that they have attained the highest excellence in worship. But in what respect? The answer can be found by connecting it with the previous verse, that is, in the matter of observing the five great vows of non-violence, etc.
For Personal & Private Use Only 

Page #39:
---------------------------
After this, in a verse called 'Dhanashri', five more names are given and it is written that they should also be made the subject of anecdotes in the same way. But what should be the subject of these anecdotes or what are they examples of, this is not indicated anywhere, nor does any good conclusion come out of the previous verses. By connecting with the first verse, the conclusion is that these five examples are also of non-violence etc. vows and therefore their worship should also be shown. However, the commentator has definitely indicated that these are examples of people who are involved in violence etc. In the fifth verse called 'Shrishen', four names are given and it is indicated that these are examples of four-fold Vyavritti.
And in the sixth verse called 'Arhacharanaspayam', it is written that in Rajgriha, a joyful (intoxicated with specific religious devotion) frog had revealed the greatness of worshiping the feet of the Arhant through a flower to the great souls.
The essence of the objections that are made or can be made to these verses is as follows:
(1) From the context of the text and its style of narration, it is clear that the text presents the religion of the Shravakas not in a didactic way but in the form of legal pronouncements or in the form of orders. In such a situation, there is no need to mention any example or anecdote or to give such verses, and therefore these verses seem completely unnecessary and out of place in the text. Their absence does not create any obstacle in relation to the subject matter of the text, etc.
(2) In the scriptures, there are many examples or anecdotes of the same subject; for example, in the vow of non-violence, the example of 'Mrigasen' the fisherman, in false speech, the example of King 'Vasuka', in non-Brahma-sevan, the example of 'Kadar Ping', and in the subject of Pari-griha, the example of 'Pinayak Gandha' is well-known. These are mentioned in the Bhagavati Aradhana and Yashastilka etc. texts. Many subjects can be exemplified from the story of the same person - for example, from the story of Varishen, the anga of positioning and the vow of non-stealing, and from the story of Anantmati, the vow of celibacy and the anga of non-desire. Similarly, there are some stories available whose examples are found in different forms. In this text, the story of Satyaghoṣa, which is made an example of false speech, is used in relation to theft in 'Bhagavati Aradhana' and 'Yashastilka'. 

Page #40:
---------------------------
Similarly, the story of Vishnu Kumar is sometimes presented in the 'Vatsalya' section instead of the 'Prabhavana' section. Given this situation in narrative literature, and the fact that there are many individuals with the same name, it cannot be expected from careful scholars like Swami Samantabhadra, who carefully weigh every word they write, that they would be content to simply cite these examples by name without mentioning their significant emotional aspects. They would not use examples that are not universally accepted, or give undue importance to a particular example over others without a purpose.

(3) If the author had desired to mention examples in his work, he would have surely highlighted the gravity of each individual's actions and the importance of their consequences in a few well-chosen words.  Furthermore, he would have mentioned examples of other topics in the same way, as found in the situation cited in the text - that is, when examples of violence and other sins are given alongside the vows of non-violence, examples of doubt and other flaws should also have been given alongside the eight limbs of right faith, such as unshakeable faith. Similarly, examples should have been given separately for those who hold and do not hold the three types of foolishness, those who consume and do not consume alcohol, meat, and honey, those who are and are not devoted to the three great vows and four lesser vows, those who attain the fruits mentioned in the verse "Uccairgotram Pranateh," those who seek refuge in Sallekhana and those who do not. However, none of this has been done, and no reasonable (appropriate) reason for not doing so is apparent in the presence of the aforementioned six verses. In such a situation, the position of the aforementioned verses becomes even more questionable.

(4) The context in which the verse "Dhanashri" is found does not clearly reveal the subject of its narratives. Such incompleteness cannot be found in Swami Samantabhadra's work.

(5) The example of a woman named "Nili" given in the context of the vow of celibacy does not seem to fit the context of the text - its composition.

See, the Tamil language text "Arungal Cheppu," which has been printed in the English Jain Gazette with a translation. 

Page #41:
---------------------------

It is said that if Swami Samantabhadra had composed this verse, then, according to the previous composition of his book, he would have given an example of a male person there - not a female; because the form of the Brahmacharya Anuvrata that he has given in the verse named 'Na Tu Paradaran Gachchati' with the names 'Paradaranivritti' and 'Swadarasantosh' is written primarily for men. The illustration should also be in accordance with it.
(6) The example of 'Jay' is given in the Parigraha Parimanavrata. In the commentary, 'Jay' is mentioned as the son of the Kuru dynasty king 'Somprabha' and the husband of Sulochana. But the story of this king 'Jay' (Jayakumar) which is found in Bhagavajinisen's 'Adipurana' shows that he is not a follower of the Parigraha Parimanavrata but a follower of the 'Paradaranivritti' named Sheelavrata - Brahmacharya Anuvrata and he was given the attainment of worship by the gods after passing the test of that vow. The commentator also could not hide this truth and even after trying, he could not make this story completely of the Anuvrata named Parigraha Pariman. He may have written this at the request of the original that 'Jay' was a limited possessor and Indra in heaven also praised his Parigraha Parimanavrata, but in the story, he could not ultimately maintain it completely. The test that he has conducted by sending a deity in the form of a woman has become a test of Jay's Sheelavrata. In the Adipurana, the greatness of Jay's Sheel is clearly mentioned in this context, some verses of which are as follows:
Amrendra sabhamadyesheelmahaatmyashansanam | Jayasya taspriyaayashcha prakurvati kadaachan || 26 || Shrutva tadadhimae kalpe raviprabhavimaanaajah | Shreeshora raviprabhaakhyena tachcheelaanveshanam prati || 26 || Preshita kaanchana naam devi prapya jayam sudhee |

The divine beings, even those with great virtue, are not superior to Jay. Knowing the greatness of her virtue, they went to their own master. || 271 ||
Ravi Prabha, pleased with her virtues, praised her greatness to them, and he was amazed. || 272 ||
He told them his story, asking for their forgiveness. After worshipping the great jewel, he went to his own abode. || 273 ||
- Chapter 47, Shri Jinaseenaacharya's Harivansh Purana also mentions the greatness of Jay's virtue in the following two verses:
"Shakra praised her, and Rati Prabha, the king of the gods, tested her, and Jay was worshipped by Meravan." || 130 ||
"Of all purities, purity of conduct is the best. Purity of conduct is the purest of all, and the servants of the gods and men." || 31 ||
- Chapter 12.
This way, the mention of Jay in the above verses is found to be contrary to her famous story, and this makes the position of the verses doubtful.
(7) The examples given in these verses, as they are cited in the commentary, if they are indeed in the same form and if they are indeed intended to be the same, then they do not seem to have any special significance for which great Acharyas like Swami Samantabhadra would need to mention them by name. They are not sufficient to strengthen the subject matter or to establish its impact on the heart. Many examples, even more significant than these, are seen and heard daily on the subject of violence and non-violence. For all these reasons, the six verses mentioned above are rejected as being the verses of Swami Samantabhadra, and it is said that they are "Kshepak".
In our opinion, the last of these objections is one that does not seem to have any force at all, because its basis is only the commentary. This is absolutely correct, and there is no doubt that the commentator has used these 

Page #43:
---------------------------
The stories given as illustrations are very ordinary and devoid of any merit, and in some places they even seem unnatural. They lack any depiction of emotions, and therefore they often appear lifeless. The commentator, while giving them, seems to have paid no attention to whether the nature of the vow, non-vow, or virtue-vice, etc., for which these illustrations are given, is clearly expressed in the character of the story, which is found in this text or other main texts, and whether any extraordinary feature is mentioned in its demonstration of results. In the story of Anantamati, nowhere is the nature of the 'Nishkankshit' limb and Anantamati's feelings about it expressed; rather, the greatness of Anantamati's vow of celibacy is mentioned here and there; in the long story of the 'Pravahana' limb, the nature of 'Pravahana' is not even shown, let alone being demonstrated; it is not even mentioned how Vajrakumar made the chariot move - whether he showed any supernatural power and how and what influence it had on Jainism; in the story of Dhandev, it seems that there was no need to explain how Dhandev's truthfulness was proved by the king, and without informing him, a decision was made in her favor by the king! In the story of Satyaghoṣa, which is given to show the fault of false speech, he is made out to be a thief, which makes this illustration, instead of being about false speech, become about theft, like other texts. And in this way, so many errors are found in all these stories that a detailed essay could be written on them. But if the commentator has not been able to present these illustrations well, has not mentioned their poignant aspects, and has not been able to make their stories influential by removing the errors, then it is all his fault. No objection can be made to the original text because of it. And the original narratives cannot be as insignificant or unimportant as they have been described in the commentary. Therefore, we say that there is no force in this 7th objection. Regarding the 6th objection, it can be said that the 'Jay' mentioned in the verse will be someone other than Sulochana's husband, or someone else 

Page #44:
---------------------------
40
In some ancient Purana, instead of or in addition to the vow of Jayako and Paridaranivritti, the vow of Parigrahaparimana may have been written about the vow-taker. But in the first instance, it must be admitted that the person was so unknown even at the time of the commentator that the commentator could not understand him and therefore he has cited 'Jay', the husband of Sulochana, as an example. In the second case, it is certainly doubtful whether the commentator was familiar with that other Purana text from the cited story. In connection with the fourth objection, it can be imagined that the verse named 'Dhanashri' has become somewhat corrupt. Its reading 'Yathakrama' also seems a bit jarring. If there was a need to give a reading of this meaning in such verses, it would definitely have been given in the verses named 'Matango' and 'Srisena' as well; because in them too, examples have been mentioned in accordance with the subjects mentioned earlier. But this is not the case; therefore, this reading seems unnecessary here. If, instead of this reading, the second reading 'Anyathasamam' of the same connection is made, then the dispute is largely resolved and then the clear meaning of this verse becomes that, along with (samam) the examples of Matanga etc. given in the first verse, these examples of 'Dhanashri' etc. should also be cited in the opposite way (anyatha) - that is, if they are examples of ahimsa etc. vows, then they should be understood as examples of violence etc. sins and if there is a display of worship etc. there, then here there should be a display of contempt and suffering. It is not a difficult thing for such a textual variation to occur. Considering the condition of the texts in the repositories, it seems quite common. But then, in connection with this textual variation, it will have to be admitted that it happened before the commentary and the commentator did not get the other correct reading. This is why he has kept the reading 'Yathakrama' and to clarify the subject of the verse, he had to imagine the phrase 'Hinsadiviratyabhave' from above in the commentary.
In connection with the remaining objections, even after much deliberation, we have not yet been able to determine a satisfactory answer that would make these verses... + Although the style of the sixth verse is somewhat different from the other verses and it also wants to consider it as part of the text, but the first objection particularly hinders it and does not allow it to be accepted as part of the text. 

Page #45:

It may be helpful to accept one part of the text. In these objections, a lot of facts are found; and therefore, without completely resolving them, the said six verses cannot be called a part of the text - - they have great hesitation in accepting them as the work of Swami Samantabhadra. It is no surprise that these verses may have been interpolated into the text even before the commentary, and due to ordinary vision or lack of examination, they may not have been noticed by the commentators. It is also possible that they were composed by some other Sanskrit commentator, and for information before the stories, they were given in their commentary, and later, while copying the original text from that commentary, they were made a part of the original by the carelessness of the scribes. But whatever it may be, there is no doubt that these verses are definitely doubtful and cannot be readily called a part of the original text or the work of Swami Samantabhadra.
In this entire investigation so far, we understand that there are no other verses in the text different from those discussed, which are found in a particularly doubtful situation or on which anyone has expressed their reasoned doubt and therefore need to be investigated at this time. Thus.
This was the examination of the verses of the text from those copies which have taken the number of verses as one hundred and fifty in this accurate way, now take the other copies in which the number of verses of the text is found to be slightly less or more.
Copies with more verses |
In the handwritten copies of the text, although, no such noteworthy copy has come to our notice so far in which the number of verses is less than one hundred and fifty; but in the 'Jain Siddhantabhavan' of Ara, there are definitely many old copies of the text on palm leaves in which the number of verses, although decreasing and increasing from each other, is found to be more than one hundred and fifty. We have had the opportunity to examine two original copies from these copies and - also to match them from two copies with strong commentaries, and from that examination, many things have been found which seem necessary to be revealed on this occasion of the examination of the verses of the text - without their

This examination, as presented, remains incomplete. Therefore, for the benefit of the readers, a summary of the examination is provided here: (1) The printed list of the building gives the number 636 to the manuscript of the Ratnakaraṇḍaśrāvakācāra, which is the original manuscript and contains 190 verses of the text. That is, 40 more verses are found in this accurate manuscript or in other printed and unprinted manuscripts containing one hundred and fifty verses. These forty verses, along with their respective locations, are as follows:

After the 21st verse, "Nāṅghīnamalaṁ":
Sūryāyo grahaṇasnānaṁ saṁkrāntau draviṇavyayaḥ | Sandhyāsevāgnisanṣkāro (satkāro) dehagehārcanāvidhiḥ ||21|| Gopṛṣṭhāntanamaṣkāraḥ tanmūtrasyaniṣevaṇaṁ | Ratnavāhanabhūvakṣaśastraśailādisevnaṁ ||23||

After the 34th verse, "Na samyaktvasaṁ":
Durgatāvāyuṣo bandhāt samyaksvam yasya jāyate |
Gaticchedo na tasyāsti tathāpyarupataraasthitiḥ ||38||

After the 37th verse, "Aṣṭaguṇa":
Uktaṁ ca-āṇimā mahimā laghīmāgarimāntardhānakāmarūpitvaṁ |
Prāpti prākāmyavaśisveśitvāpratihatatvamiti vaikriyikāḥ ||4||

After the 38th verse, "Navanidhi":

After the 52nd verse, "Prāṇātipāta":
Svayam evātmanātmanaṁ hinastyatmā kaṣāyavān | Pūrva prāṇyantaraṇāṁ tu paścātsyadvā na vā vadhaḥ ||60||

After the 62nd verse named 'Ativahna'
**71.**  Giving up violence, falsehood, stealing, lust, and attachment to worldly possessions are the five vows.  The sixth vow is the vow of kingship.
**72.**  One who gives up two ghatikas (48 minutes) at the beginning and end of the day, and who is aware of the faults of eating at night, eats as a recipient of merit.
**73.**  The wise ones declare that silence during mealtimes is the discipline of knowledge, and the protection of pride.
**74.**  One should perform actions like defecation, urination, bathing, and worship with silence.
**75.**  One should give up seeing flesh, blood, skin, bones, and pus.  One should abstain from eating food that has been seen by a dead body, and from using things that have been used by a dead body.
**76.**  One should avoid eating when seeing, hearing, or smelling elephants, horses, or other animals.  One should also avoid eating when seeing excrement or urine.

After the 66th verse named 'Madyamamsa'
**8.**  There is no compassion in meat-eaters, no truth in drinkers of alcohol, no sense of Dharma in those who eat honey, sugarcane, and mangoes.

After the 85th verse named 'AlpPhal'
**101.**  There are gross and subtle beings in the middle of the udumbara fruit.  Therefore, the Jinas have instructed us to avoid the five udumbara fruits.
**102.**  One who eats fruit that has been touched by the taste of another, and whose body is mixed with the taste of another, will find that his renunciation of meat is in vain.
**103.**  One who eats bilva, laboo, or phala fruits should not eat the fruit of the shiliduka tree.  One should also avoid milk from the beginning of the 15th lunar day, as it is born from a male.
**104.**  Even pure water, if it has been melted, becomes contaminated for a moment.  Water that has been heated for a day and night, or that has been boiled in a pot that has been used for cooking meat, should be avoided.
**105.**  One should not use water or oil in vessels that are about to break.  One should not keep butter on the head for more than half a prahara (3 hours).

**(2) In the second original manuscript of the building, numbered 631, five verses numbered 43, 44, 45, 60, and 81 out of the above forty verses are completely missing; in the remaining thirty-five verses, fifteen verses numbered 22, 23, 37, 135, 136, 137, 162, 163, 165, 166, 67, 184, 185, 186, and 187 are not considered part of the original text - they are given in the margins as notes, and among them, three verses like 'Khandani Peshani' etc. are given with 'Uktan Cha' and 'Eka-'.** 

Page #50:
---------------------------
The words "Uktāṃ ca catuṣṭayaṃ" are also found along with the four verses beginning with "Daśake." Three verses numbered 41, 174, and 176 have been made part of the text and placed within brackets at the end, indicating that these verses are not part of the original text and were mistakenly written in the middle. They should have been written in the margin as a commentary. In this way, eighteen verses have not been made part of the text. Out of the remaining seventeen verses that have been made part of the text, twelve verses numbered 71 to 76, 101 to 105, and 172 are given as "Uktāṃ ca," "Uktāṃ ca pañcakaṃ," etc., indicating that these verses are from other Ācāryas who lived before Śrī Samantabhadra, and that Samantabhadra has quoted them in his original text. However, the verse numbered 142, "Bhaishajyadānato," which is given with the words "Uktāṃ ca trayaṃ" in the first manuscript, is found here without the word "Uktāṃ." Therefore, the implication in the first manuscript that the following verses, "Śrīṣeṇa" and "Devādhideva," which are found in manuscripts with one hundred and fifty verses, should also be considered "Uktāṃ ca," is not present in this manuscript. Another peculiarity observed in this manuscript is that the mention of the six verses that follow the 62nd verse, "Ativāhanā," found in the first manuscript, is not present in this manuscript. Only the 72nd verse, "Aho Mukhe," is mentioned there, and it is also placed within brackets. These six verses are given in this manuscript after the 66th verse, "Madyamaṃsa," as "Uktāṃ ca," and after them, the 63rd original verse, "Pañcāṇuvrata," is quoted again.

(3) The third manuscript of the Bhavana, numbered 641, contains a Kannada commentary. In it, all forty verses from the first original manuscript, which have been quoted above, are found as part of the commentary in their respective previously mentioned places and in the same order. Only in place of the verse numbered 166, "Dyūtaṃ ca māṃsa," the commentary gives a verse with the same meaning:

Dyūtaṃ māṃsaṃ surā vaiśyā pāpārddha paradārata |
Stoyen saha sapteti vyasanāni vidūrayet ||

##  Translation:

17.  Besides this, there is another special feature that in the first original manuscript, the phrase "Uktan Cha" and "Uktan Cha Trayam" were only associated with five verses. In this manuscript, in addition to those verses, these phrases are found associated with 21 other verses - that is, five verses from number 101 to 105 are associated with "Uktan Cha Panchak", three verses from number 135* to 137 are associated with "Uktan Cha", three verses from number 165 to 167 are associated with "Uktan Cha Trayam", verses numbered 172, 174, 176 are associated with "Uktan Cha" individually, three verses from number 179 to 181 are associated with "Uktan Cha Trayam", and four verses from number 184 to 187 are associated with "Uktan Cha Chatushtayam".  Additionally, in this commentary and other commentaries, the verses named "Shreeshen" and "Devadhidev" are also quoted together as "Uktan Cha Trayam" along with the path named "Bhaishajya Danato".  From the preface of the Ratnakaranḍa Shravakacharaki published by Bhau Babaji Lade, it seems that in the Kannada script manuscript with 200 verses, after the verse named "Bhaishajya Danato", this verse is also given:

> Shastradanphalenaarama kalasu sakalasvapi.
> Parijnata bhavetpascha skevalgyanabhajanam.

It is possible that these three verses are all associated with the phrase "Uktan Cha Trayam" along with the verse named "Shreeshen", and this verse named "Shastradan" might have been omitted from these Kannada commentary manuscripts.

(4) The fourth manuscript, numbered 629, of the Bhavan is also with the Kannada commentary. Its condition is almost like the third manuscript, the only special feature worth mentioning here is that the phrase "Uktan Cha" is not given with the verse numbered 174, and instead of "Uktan Cha", the phrase "Uktan Cha Trayam" is used with the verse numbered 172, but only one verse is given after them.  Besides this, in this commentary, the phrase "Uktan Cha" is written with the verse numbered 60, "Uktan Cha Shatum" with six verses from number 71 to 76, and "Uktan Cha Dwayam" with two verses numbered 162 and 163.  And this mention of these 9 verses is more in this manuscript than in the third manuscript.

*Verses numbered 135 and 136 are also quoted in this Sanskrit commentary of Ratnakaranḍa as "Tadu-ktan" ... etc.

(5) This introduction of the four copies clearly shows how much difference there is between the two original copies. The verses that are given in one copy as commentary, etc., are found in the other copy in the original form. Similarly, the verses that were quoted from other texts in both commentaries in the form of 'Uktan Cha' etc. and made a part of the commentary, were made a part of the original by the writers of the said original copies or the copies before them. Although, from this introduction, there is no need to tell anyone that the 40 verses that are added in the first original copy and the 17 verses that are made a part of the original in the second original copy are not all verses of the original text; but are only parts of the commentary - a knowledgeable reader can easily reach this conclusion from the position of these verses in the text, their relationship with the previous and subsequent verses, their availability in the commentaries, the literary context of the text, the style of presentation of the text, the nature of Samantabhadra's original texts and his experience regarding the verses etc. of other texts - that they are all verses of other texts and have been interpolated in these copies and other copies like them in some way - yet, for the satisfaction of ordinary readers, it would not be inappropriate to reveal here, by way of example, in relation to some verses, which texts they are verses of and what is their position in this text. Therefore, a little of the same is presented below.
a- These two verses, 'Suryaay Grahanasnanam', 'Goprishtantanamaskarah', are verses of the sixth Aswas of the Yasastilak text and are found in its fourth Kalpa. In the second original copy, although they are given below as commentary, yet in the first original copy, they are given before the verse 'Apagasagarasnanam' to indicate that these are verses indicative of Lokamudhata and, in this way, the author has given three verses of Lokamudhata. But this is not the case. The author has given the remaining two mudhatas
* This introduction is given from the note that we prepared with the help of Pt. Shantirajji while observing the Jain Siddhantabhavan, Ara.
+ It seems against the nature of Swami Samantabhadra's original texts that some verses in both the original copies are made a part of the text in the form of 'Uktan Cha'. 

Page #53:
---------------------------
The description of 'Lokamudhata' is also given in the same verse. The 13th century scholar, Pt. Ashadharji, has also quoted the same three verses in his commentary on 'Anugardharmamrit', under the name of 'Swamisamantbhadra', with the word 'Swamisukkani', which are found in this authentic text, as indicative of the 'Mudhatraya'. Apart from this, the above two verses are not indicative of 'Lokamudhata' alone. Nor are they indicated as such. In Yashatilak, this verse is given in between them:
Nadina-dasamudreshu majanam dharmachetasaam |
Tarustupanabhaktaanaam vandanam bhrgusamsrayah |
And in this way, a kind of collection of the statements of the 'Mudhatas' has been made in all the three verses, but the separate form of any one has not been given - as is evident from the following verse after them:
Samayantarapasandavadalokasamasrayam |
Evam adi vimudhaanaam jneyam mudham anekadha |
From all this statement, it becomes absolutely clear that the above two verses are not from the original text but from Yashatilak.
B - The verse numbered 165, called 'Mudhatraya', is also a verse from the sixth Aswas (Kalpa No. 21) of Yashatilak. It clearly appears to be quoted for the commentary on the word 'Samyagdarshanashuddha' - it is also given in the second counter-commentary. It has no connection with the context of the original text - it appears unnecessary there. Swamisamantbhadra has given the form of each image in the form of a verse.
Similarly, verses No. 81, 137, called 'Mansasishu' and 'Shraddhashakti', also appear to be from Yashatilak. They are found in its 7th and 8th Aswas respectively, with slight variations in the text. They also do not match the context of the original text. * In the first verse, the text 'Anrishansyam na mtryeshu' is given in place of 'Dharmabhavo na jiveshu'. And in the second verse, 'Tushti' in place of 'Shakti', 'Kshamashakti' in place of 'Dayakshanti' and 'Yatraite' in place of 'Yasmaite' are given, which are very common. 

Page #54:
---------------------------
No. The mention of "Udumbaraseva" in the first verse, especially, seems jarring - these verses seem to have been quoted only for commentary. The first verse is not even present in the second copy, and the second is found only in its commentary. This also... these original verses do not seem to be authentic. The verse numbered 72, "G-Ahnomukhevasane", is a verse from Hemachandracharya's "Yogashastra" and is found on number 63 in its third light. Here, there is no connection with the method of the original text and its subject matter.
D- "Vadhadasatyat", the 71st verse, is a verse from the "Charitrasar" text of Chamunda Raya and seems to have been taken from there. The mention of the five Panchanuvratas in it has already come before, in the 52nd verse of the original text. Swami Samantabhadra's style of presentation does not involve such unnecessary repetitions. Moreover, the number of Anuvratas is given as five in the 51st verse, and here in this verse, "Rajyabhukti" is also mentioned as the sixth Anuvrata, which makes this verse seem completely unconnected with the text.
Similarly, the three verses "Darshanikavratakavapi", "Aarambhadvinivrittah" and "Adyastu Shat Jaganyah" also seem to have been taken from the Charitrasar text and are found in their respective places there. In the second original copy, they have also been quoted only as commentary, and in the commentary, they are given in the form of "Uktan Cha". They seem unnecessary in the context of the original text.
- "Maunam Bhojanvelayaam", "Mansaraktarracharmaasthi", "Sthulaah Sukshmaastatha Jivah", these three verses numbered 73, 75 and 101 are verses from the Upasakaachar written by Pujyapada, whose examination article we published in the 12th issue of Jaithiteeshi Part 15. In it, these verses are recorded at numbers 29, 28 and 11 respectively. Here, they have no connection with the literature, context, etc. of the text and seem quite unconnected.
The same is the case with other verses, and they cannot be part of the original text at all. Like the aforementioned verses, they were quoted at some point in time by some person as commentary for their memory, etc., and later, while copying the original text from those copies containing commentary, the writing... 

Page #55:
---------------------------
Through carelessness and foolishness, the original texts have been made into a misshapen or distorted limb. It is true, "A dead body in hand, whether you bury it or blow on it." The scriptures cannot say anything to us, someone breaks them or twists them, makes them bulky or makes them thin, all this is the game of the writers and their creation!! It is impossible to even estimate how much dirt has been spoiled by these foolish or ignorant writers. Due to this corruption of the scriptures, many misconceptions have spread and there are great difficulties in knowing the true state of affairs. Shruta Sagar Suri also probably got a similar copy of the scripture and he considered those four verses, starting with "Ekadashake", to be created by Swami Samantabhadra, which are found in the first original copy after the 147th verse called "Grihato Muni Vanmitva". This is the reason why he has mentioned them in the commentary of "Shatpraabhrut" with the name of Maha Kavi Samantabhadra and has written "Uktan Cha Samantabhadrena Maha Kavina" at the beginning of them. Otherwise, they are not found in any of Samantabhadra's works, nor do they indicate from their literature that their author is a learned scholar and Maha Kavi Acharya like Swami Samantabhadra. They are definitely verses from some other scripture or scriptures and this is why they are quoted in the commentary of the second original copy and in both Kannada commentaries with the words "Uktan Cha Chatustayam". One verse from among them has already been mentioned above from the Charitrasar scripture.
It may not be irrelevant to point out here that it is a matter of great shame for those who consider themselves devotees of Jinvani Mata or who boast of her devotion, that such a bad condition of their own religious scriptures is found in their treasure houses of scriptures. The mother is being looted in front of them, she is being tortured, her limbs are being distorted or dismembered, someone is even violating her chastity, and they remain silent, not caring about her at all! Is this the name of motherly devotion? This can never be called motherly devotion. Such conduct of the sons is a great disgrace for them and
* See, the commentary of Sutra Praamrit, verse number 21.

India.
They deserve to be condemned. They should take true care of the mother and make arrangements for her true protection - they should make such a grand arrangement that every part of the Jina-vani, every religious text, is available in its original state, in its true form, in which it was given birth by some Acharya. Only then will they be able to brighten their faces and call themselves devotees of the Jina-vani mother. Thus.
Summary of the investigation. The summary of this long and wide investigation is only this:
1- There are two types of copies of the text - one is those that have taken this exact number of one hundred and fifty verses, and the other is those that have been indicated above as "copies with more verses". No third type of copy worthy of mention has been found so far which has less than one hundred and fifty verses. But there is a good chance of such copies being available. No sufficient effort has been made to find them yet, which is necessary.
2- Of the verses of this copy of the text with one hundred and fifty verses, which are said to be interpolated or suspected of being interpolated, except for the verses of "Chaturaharavisarjan" and the verses with illustrations, the interpolation of the remaining verses does not seem reasonable and therefore the doubt about their subject matter seems to be almost eradicated.
3- In the text, the verse called "Chaturaharavisarjan" and the six verses with illustrations, such seven verses are found in a very doubtful situation. There seems to be no reasonable reason to consider them part of the text and to accept the verses of Swami Samantabhadra. They happily fall into the second, third and fifth parts of the criterion (reasoning) given at the beginning of this chapter for examining interpolations. But in the case of these verses being interpolated, it will have to be admitted that they have been interpolated in the text for a long time - they have entered the text before this commentary and therefore there is a special need to find out such ancient and unambiguous copies of the text which are before this commentary - written before the 13th century Vikram era - or which are specifically of the nature 

Page #57:
---------------------------
To shed light on the subject, it is necessary to investigate which texts composed before the 13th century contain these verses and in what form. It is also important to determine if any other commentaries on this text exist from before this Sanskrit commentary. If so, these verses and other verses will be illuminated further, and the matter will become much clearer. _4-In copies with more verses, the verses that are found more often are all interpolations. Almost all the reasons for their being interpolations are fulfilled, and their "position in the text is found to be very objectionable. They seem to be clearly quoted from other texts as commentary and later made part of the text by the grace of later writers. To consider such verses as part of the text is to make it clumsy and awkward. Such copies are not for a number of verses, and this fact further strengthens their interpolations.
It is hoped that the effort that has been made for this investigation and the space that has been taken up in the introduction will not be in vain. Knowledgeable readers will surely benefit from experiencing the many situations, circumstances and events through this, and will be greatly instrumental in understanding the true state of affairs. At the same time, it is also hoped that the devotees of Jinavani Mata will not continue their harmful negligence towards the scriptures for much longer, and will soon make a concrete effort to truly protect, truly inform and truly liberate her, so that every scripture is available to all in its original state.
Commentary and commentator Prabhachandra. Apart from a Sanskrit commentary called 'Ratnakarandaka-Vishamapadavyakhyana' on this text, which is available at the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan in Ara, and from which nothing is known about its author, this is the only Sanskrit commentary on this text. * There are also some commentaries on this text in the Kannada language, but nothing is known about their authors, etc. Tamil language 'Arungal 

Page #58:
---------------------------
This is the commentary that has been made available along with this text. We have mentioned something about this commentary on the previous pages, and from that, one can get a fair idea of the commentary. We wished that a detailed critique of this commentary could be written, but due to lack of time and the author's increasing age, that task could not be accomplished. Here, regarding the commentary, it seems appropriate to only request that this commentary is mostly ordinary - it is not sufficient to properly reveal the essence of the text, nor is there any good discussion of the principles of householder dharma found in it - it mostly takes the form of a word-by-word translation of the text. In some places, even the translation of necessary words has been omitted; for example, in the commentary of the verse named 'bhayaashaasneha', there is no translation or explanation of the word 'kudevaagamalinginaam', which was especially necessary to provide, and in many verses, the word 'aadi' has not been explained, which makes it unclear what is meant by it. Besides this, three special features are found in the commentary.

Firstly, in it, the original text has been divided into five chapters instead of seven - that is, the chapters 'gunavat' and 'pratima' have not been kept as separate chapters, but have been included in the chapters 'anuvrat' and 'sallekhana' respectively. It is not clear whether this is the result of the author's grace or the commentator's own arrangement. As far as we understand, from the perspective of subject division, the seven chapters of the text seem correct, and they are found in the original copies of the text. * If there were no seven chapters, then the 'chaar chheppu' (ratnakarandaka) text seems to have been created by keeping this text in front of it, and except for a few exceptions, it appears to be mostly a paraphrase or summary of it. (See, its English translation published in the English Jain Gazette.) However, it is not known when it was created or who created it, nor can it be called a commentary in the Tamil language. In Hindi, the commentary (independent explanation) of Pandit Sadāsukhji is well-known.  _ * See Ratnakarandashravakaachaar published in the first volume of 'Sanatan Jain Granthamala', which was published by Nirnayasagar Press Bombay in 1905. 

Page #59:
---------------------------
It should have been. The right of the Gunavratas, along with the phrase "evam panchaprakaramanuvratam pratipayedani trihprakaram gunavratam pratipadayavaha", should be included in the Anuvrat-paricched, but it is not clear what it means to not include the statement of the Shikshavrata. This makes this particular feature of the commentary seem objectionable to us.

The second feature is that it cites all six verses with illustrations, i.e., it gives their twenty-three stories. How ordinary, devoid of glory, lifeless, and objectionable these stories are, and what errors are found in them, some information on this subject has been given on the previous pages, under the heading "Sandigdhapadya", while considering the seventh objection. In fact, a good essay could be written to demonstrate the errors of these stories, which is neglected here.

The third feature is that this commentary states that the eleven steps of the Shravaka - images, categories or Gunasthanas - are the eleven distinctions of the Sallekhanaanushtata (the Shravaka who dies in meditation), i.e., it states that these are the eleven distinctions of those Shravakas who die in meditation - who practice the Sallekhana Vrata. As in "Sampratam yo'sau sallekhanaanushtata shravakastasya katipritima bhavantityashankyaha
Shravakapadani devairekadash deshitani yeshu khalu.
Swagunah purvagunaih saha santishthante kramavivruddhah ||" In this passage, the latter part, "Shravakapadani", is a verse from the original text, and the part before it is the commentator's sentence, which he has given as information about the subject, etc., of the said verse. This sentence states that "Now, the Shravaka who is the practitioner of Sallekhana, how many images does he have, fearing this, the Acharya says." But in the said verse of Acharya Mahoray, neither is such a doubt raised nor is it stated that these are 11. In many other editions published by Jain Granthratnakar Karyalaya, Mumbai, etc., and in old handwritten manuscripts, the same seven chapters are found which were mentioned at the beginning of the introduction under "Granthparichay". 

Page #60:
---------------------------
The images are of the Shravaka who performs Sallekhana; rather, by using the term 'Shravakapadani', it has been generally accepted that all Shravakas are included - that is, it has been stated that Shravaka people are divided into 11 categories. Apart from this, in the next verses, there is no prevalence or application of the characteristics of Sallekhana in the different forms of the 11 categories of Shravakas - even without performing Sallekhana, a Shravaka can follow many images and be adorned with those positions. Therefore, the commentator's writing seems to be almost contrary to the meaning of the original text. It is not supported by other main texts either - no such provision is found in the texts of any other Acharya or scholar who mentions the images, which would make it clear that these images are the eleven categories of the Shravaka who performs Sallekhana. On the contrary, it is seen that all these Shravakas have been inspired to take Sallekhana when they are close to death, an example of which is this sentence from the 'Charitrasar' text - "Uktarupasakaikaranantiki Sallekhana pritiya seviya." And this is also correct, Sallekhana is taken only when one is close to death, and the rest of the religions - vrata-niyamaadics are usually performed throughout life. Therefore, these 11 images are not just the categories of the Shravaka who performs Sallekhana, but are the categories of Shravakaachar-vidhi, the special categories of those who practice Shravakadharma, and almost all Shravakas are included in them. In our opinion, the commentator should have used the term 'Sadharmanushthata' instead of 'Sallekhananushthata'. If this were to happen, the commentary would also be in harmony with the original text; because in the original, the fruit of that Sadharma - or appropriate Dharma - has been mentioned before, the mention of which Acharya Mahadev had promised at the beginning of the text, and the words 'phalati Sadharma' are also clearly given in the previous verse, the practitioner of that Sadharma has been divided into 11 categories by the next verses. But it seems that the commentator may not have wanted to do so, and perhaps this is the reason why the same is found in the following verse of Acharya Amitagati:

Ekaadashoktataviditarthattvairopasakaacharavidhervibhedaah. Pavitramaraodhumanasyalabhyam sopanamargava ivasiddhisoudham.
-Upasakaachar. 

Page #61:
---------------------------

He has included both the rights of Sallekhana and images in the same chapter. But whatever it may be, this third characteristic is also worthy of objection. Thus. This commentary is made by Acharya Prabhachandra. But there is no praise of Prabhachandra in the commentary, nor is the time of its creation given, nor has the commentator mentioned the name of his guru anywhere. In such a situation, it is natural to ask who made this commentary and when it was made; and it is certainly worthy of consideration here; because there have been dozens of Acharyas named Prabhachandra in the Jain community, of whom some - whose general introduction or address we have been able to research so far - are as follows:
(1) Prabhachandra, whose mention is found in the first inscription of Shravanabelagola, and who is said to be the disciple of Emperor Chandragupta, the disciple of Bhadrabahu Shrutakevali.
(2) Prabhachandra, whose mention is found in the sutra 'Ratreh Kriti Prabhachandrasya' of Jainendra Grammar written by Shri Pujyapada.
(3) Prabhachandra, whose mention is found in the 'Gurvavali' of Shubhachandracharya published in the 4th Kiran of Jain Siddhanta Bhaskar and in the list of Acharyas in 'Nandisangha's Padyaavali', after 'Lokachand' and before 'Nemichand'. Along with this, the time of his being established on the pattavali is also given as VS 453. If this time is correct, then the second Prabhachandra and these two may also be one person.
* In 1921-22, some scholars had discussed the subject of the authorship of this commentary, and many articles were published in the Jainmitra, Jain Siddhanta, Jainbodhak and Jain Hitechchu newspapers under headings like 'How many Prabhachandras are there'. The number of scholars named Prabhachandra published in those articles was probably not more than five.
This mention is also found in 'Gurvavali' and 'Pattavali' published in Jain Hiteishi, Part Six, Issue 7-8.

(4) They are Prabhachandra, who was a disciple of the Parlur-resident Acharya 'Vinayanandi' and to whom the Chalukya king 'Kirtivarma' I had given a donation. This Acharya was a scholar of the 6th and 7th centuries Vikram, because the existence of the said Kirtivarma is found in the year Shaka 489.
(5) The famous Prabhachandra, the author of 'Pramey Kamal Martanda' and 'Nyaya Kumud Chandrodya', who was a disciple of Acharya Manikyanandi, the author of 'Pariksha Mukh', and whose praise has been sung by Shri Jinaseanacharya, the author of Adi Purana. This Acharya was a scholar of the 8th and 9th centuries Vikram. The great commentary 'Shabda Amboj Bhaskar' on Jainendra grammar is also probably his work, and perhaps he is also the author of 'Shakatayana Nyasa'; because, in the 46th inscription of Nagar Taluk, found in Shimoga district, a verse is found as follows:
Sukhi....Namah to the author of Nyaya Kumud Chandrodya.
Shakatayana Nyasa creator, Vratinda. (6) They are Prabhachandra, who was a disciple of 'Pushpanandi' and a disciple of 'Toranacharya', and for whom a Vatika was built in Shaka Samvat 719, Vikram Samvat 854, which is mentioned in a copper plate of the Rashtrakuta king Govinda III. Your mention is also found in another copper plate of Shaka 724.
(7) They are Prabhachandra, who was a disciple of 'Vrishabhanandi', also known as 'Chaturmukadeva', and a co-student (brother of the guru) of Acharya 'Gopanandi' of the Vakragachchha; and
* See 'South Indian Jainism', Part II, p. 88. * A copy of this commentary is available at the Saraswati Bhavan in Bombay, but even though it is about 12,000 verses long, it is incomplete - the commentary of the last two chapters is not in it - the complete commentary is said to be 30,000 verses long, as informed by Pandit Nathuramji Premi. + See, the introduction of 'Shatprabhritadisangraha' published in Manikchandragranthamala. x Hoysala king Ereyanga had donated two villages to Gopanandi for renovation and other works in Shaka Samvat 1015.

The following sentences are given in the inscription No. 55 (69) of Shravanabelagola in praise of him:
"Sri Dharadhipati Bhojaraja Mukuta Protaimarashminchhata. Chhaya Kumpa Pankalipta Charanambhojat Lakshmi Dhavaha. Nyaya Abjakaramandane Dinamanish Shabdaabja Rodho Mani. Sthaya Spandita Pundarika Tarani Sriman Prabha Chandrama. Sri Chaturmukha Devana Shikshyo Dhrisya Pravadibhi. Pandita Sri Prabha Chandra Rudravadgajakusha."

From these introductory sentences, it is known that this Prabha Chandra was a very great scholar of Nyaya and grammar, and his lotus feet were worshipped by Dharadhipati Bhojaraja. Therefore, he should be considered a contemporary of King Bhoj or a scholar of the latter half of the 11th century Vikram era and the first half of the 12th century.

(8) That Prabha Chandra who was a Sadharma of 'Kulbhushan', a disciple of 'Padmanandi' the Aviddhakarna Saiddhantic - and therefore a disciple of 'Kumardeva', the famous name of the said Padmanandi - and who is remembered in the 40th inscription of Shravanabelagola with the epithets 'Prathith Tarkagranthakar', etc. As follows:
"Shabdaambhoruha Bhaskara Prathith Tarkagranthakar Prabha
Chandakhyo Muni Raja Pandita Vara Sri Kundakunda Anvaya."
This Acharya was a scholar of the 11th century Vikram era.

(9) That Prabha Chandra who is described in the following verse given at the end of the printed copy of 'Pramaye Kamal Martanda' as a disciple of 'Padmanandi Saiddhanta' and devoted to the 'Ratnanandi' पद:
"Sri Padmanandi Saiddhanta Shishyo'neka Gunalaya.
Prabha Chandra Chiranjiya Ratnanandipade Rata."
... In the prose lines that follow, he is described as a scholar residing in Dharana and a contemporary of King Bhojadeva:
"Sri Bhojadeva Rajye Srimad Dharanivasina Parapapara Parameshti Padpranama Arjita Amal Punya Nirakrut Nikhil Malakalanka Srimat Prabha Chandra Panditen Nikhil Praman Pramaye Swarupo Yota Pariksha Mukha Padam Idam Vivritamiti."

---------------------------
This Prabhachandra appears to be the commentator of 'Pramaayakamalmartad', hence the above verse and prose lines are not found in all the copies of the text*. In the printed copy, the seven lines that have been printed after the end of the first chapter's mangal are clearly the commentary of the said mangal verse and indicate that it is a part of the commentary of the text. Besides this, the footnotes that are in the printed copy are also mostly taken from the same commentary.
_If the guru of this Prabhachandra, 'Padmanandisiddhanta', and the guru of the 8th Prabhachandra, 'Aviddhakarn Padmanandisiddhantic', are both the same person, then these two Prabhachandras could also be the same person; and if this Prabhachandra is also a disciple of 'Chaturmukhadeva', then the 7th Prabhachandra could also be the same person as them._
(10) The Prabhachandra who was the chief disciple of Meghachandravidyadeva and the guru of the queen 'Shantaldevi' of king Vishnuvardhan, and whose ascension is mentioned in the inscription no. 50 of Shravanabelagola in Saka Samvat 1068 (Vikram Samvat 1203). Your mention is found in many other inscriptions of this place. Your guru Meghachandra's departure to Devalok was in Saka Samvat 1037, as found from the 48th inscription.
(11) The Prabhachandra who is written as the disciple of 'Nayakirti', the Mahamandalacharya, in inscription no. 130, written in Saka Samvat 1118 of Shravanabelagola. Nayakirti's demise was in Saka Samvat 1099 (Vikram Samvat 1234), as mentioned in the said * The two copies of this text in Devanagari script, which are present in the 'Bhandarkar Institute' of Pune, do not have the said prose lines in any of them, and the 836 number copy, which is a copy made from an old copy written in Vikram Samvat 1489, does not have the said verse either, as informed by Pandit Nathuramji Premi himself after seeing those copies.
+ The editor of the text, Pandit Vanshidharji Shastri, while accepting this, has revealed to his friend Pandit Nathuramji that the copy from which this text has been printed is with detailed commentary; and the commentary that has been printed is not his own. 

Page #65:
---------------------------
It is found in the inscription No. 42 of the place, and therefore this Prabhachandra was a scholar of the early half of the 13th century Vikram era.
(12) He is Prabhachandra, who wrote a commentary on the Prakrit 'Uttara Purana' of 'Pushpadanta' in the reign of Jaisingh and who was a resident of Dharanagari. The eulogy* of this commentary is as follows
"Nityam tatra tava prasannamanas yatpunyamatyadbhutam yatantena samastavastuvishayam cetacchamarakarakaḥ | Vyākhyātam hi tadā purāṇamamalam svaspashtiṣṭākṣaraḥ bhūyāñcetaṣi dhīmatāmatitarām candrārkatārāvadhiḥ || 1 || Tattvādhāramahapuraṇagamanayotī janānandanah sarvaprāṇimanahprabedapatutāpraspaṣṭavākyaḥ karaḥ | Bhavyābjapratibodhakaḥ samudito bhūbhṛtprabhācandrataḥ
Jiyāṭṭipanakah pracandataraniḥ sarvārtham agradhyutiḥ || 2 || Śrījayasiṃhadevarājye śrīmaddhārānivāsina parāparaparameṣṭhipranāmopārjitā.. malapuṇyanirākṛtākhilamalkalanken śrīprabhācandrapanditena mahāpurāṇatippaṇake śatatrādhīkasahasratrayaparimaṇam kṛtamiti |" - It is known that this Jaisingh king, in whose reign the said commentary was written. was the successor of 'Devapaldev' and was also called 'Jaitu gidev'. He ascended the throne of his father sometime between Vikram Samvat 1292 and 1296 and his reign is found till Vikram Samvat 1312 or 1313. The famous scholar Pt. Ashadharji wrote commentaries on 'Sagardharmamrit' and 'Anagardharmamrit' in the reign of this king.
But in the above eulogy, Prabhachandra has used the same two epithets for himself besides 'Dharanivasi' which are found in the last prose lines of the commentary on 'Pramayakamalamatenda' quoted in number 9 and from this it can be said that both the commentators were the same person. If this
* This eulogy . was copied by Pt. Pannalalji Bakliwal from the 223rd copy of the treasure of Jaipur Patodi temple. We came to know this from a letter of his, dated 4th June 1923. 

Page #66:
---------------------------
• Therefore, it must be said that the commentary on *Pramayakamalmartad* was written during the reign of King Bhoj (I) and the commentary on *Mahapuraan* was written during the reign of his successor, Jayasimha (I), or it must be said that the commentary on *Mahapuraan* was written during the reign of Jayasimha (II) and the commentary on *Pramayakamalmartad* was written during the reign of Bhoj (II) - around Vikram Samvat 1340. Alternatively, it can also be said that both Prabhachandra were residents of the same stream, but were different from each other, and one of them imitated the other and used those epithets for himself, which are generally common in terms of meaning and do not have any special historical significance. In the last verses of the commentary on *Uttarapurana*, which have also been quoted above, there is a lot of imitation of the last verses of *Pramayakamalmartad*, and from this similarity, it cannot be said that Prabhachandra, the author of *Pramayakamalmartad*, is the commentator of *Uttarapurana*, because *Uttarapurana* was not even born during the time of these Prabhachandra - it is found to be made in Shaka Samvat 887 (Vikram Samvat 1022) Krodhan Samvatsar and it mentions 'Virasen' 'Jinsen' along with their commentaries *Dhaval* and *Jayadhaval*. The state of Jayasimha's reign, the successor of Bhoj, is also found to be very doubtful in history. From all these things, it seems to us that the commentator of *Pramayakamalmartad* may be contemporary of Bhoj I or Bhoj II, but the commentator of the said *Uttarapurana* is Jayasimha. *These verses are as follows:*

गंभीरं निखिलार्थगोचरमलं शिष्यप्रबोधप्रदं यध्यक्तं पदमद्वितीयमखिलं माणिक्यनन्दिप्रभोः । तद्व्याख्यातमदो यथावगमतो किंचिन्मया लेशतः स्थेयाच्छुद्धधियां मनोरतिगृहे चन्द्रार्कतारावधि ॥ १॥ मोहध्वान्तविनाशनो निखिलतो विज्ञानशुद्धिप्रदो भेयानन्तनभोविसर्पणपटुर्वस्तूक्तिभाभासुरः। शिष्याब्जप्रतिबोधनः समुदितो योऽद्रे परीक्षामुखाजीयासोऽत्रनिबन्ध एष सुचिरं मार्तण्डतुल्योऽमलः ॥ २॥ 

Page #67:
---------------------------
(13) These Prabhachandra were the *vidya-guru* (teacher) of *Shrutamuni*, the author of the Prakrit *Bhavasangraha* (*Bhavatribhangi*). They are remembered in the praise of the *Bhavasangraha* with epithets like *Saratrayanipuna*. The epithet *Saratrayanipuna* suggests that they were well-versed in the *Samayasara*, *Pravachansara*, and *Panchaastikaya* texts. Therefore, the commentaries attributed to Prabhachandra in the list titled "Jain Authors and their Works" are likely to have been written by these Prabhachandra. These Prabhachandra were scholars of the 13th and 14th centuries Vikram Samvat; because Balachandra Muni, a disciple of Abhayachandra Saiddhantak, who was almost contemporary with Shrutamuni, wrote a commentary on the *Dravyasangraha* sutra in Shaka Samvat 1195 (Vikram Samvat 1330), which is mentioned in the *Karnataka-Kavicharitra* or *Karnataka Jainakavi*. The mention of Vikram Samvat 1316 in the aforementioned bibliography also corresponds to their time.

(14) These Prabhachandra are mentioned in the *Vidvajjanabodhaka* as having become a *Raktambara* in Delhi in Samvat 1305 after being corrupted. They had adopted red garments by the order of the emperor and, with royal patronage, had propagated various forms of falsehood and wrong paths at that time. Their time should also be considered to be the 13th and 14th centuries Vikram Samvat. Since their guru's name is not known, it cannot be said whether they were different from or the same as any of the previously mentioned Prabhachandra. - A *Raktambara* Prabhachandra has also become the commentator of *Bhagavati Aradhana*, which is mentioned in the aforementioned bibliography. It is not known whether they were the same or different from these.

(15) These Prabhachandra are mentioned in the 4th *kirana* of the *Jain Siddhanta Bhaskara*. 

Page #68:
---------------------------
In the *Shita*, *Shubhachanda* *Gurvawali* and the second lineage of the *Mula* (Nandi) Sangha, it is written that Prabhachandra was the *patta-shishya* of Shubhakirti, the *pra-patta-shishya* of Ratna Kirti and the *patta-guru* of Padmanandi. It is also indicated by the following verse that Prabhachandra's fame became known in the world due to his explanation of the scriptures of Pujyapada:

*Patte Shrirnatna Kirteranupmatapasah Pujyapadayashastra-vyakhya-vikhyatakirtirgunaganinidhipas Satkriyacharuchanchu. Shrimanananandhama pratibudhanutama manasandayivado 'jiyadaachandrataram narapatividitah: Shri Prabhachandradeva:*

These Prabhachandra, who were the *patta-shishya* of 'Shubhakirti' (Ratna Kirti's *patta-guru* 1), were *Vanavasi* *Amnayake*, as it is known from the *Gurvawali*. *Shravan:* In the *Gurvawali* printed in the 6th part, issue 7-8, which is *Jainhitaishi*, all this is given.

In one place in the *Gurvawali*, Shubhakirti is also mentioned as the *patta-guru* of Dharma Chandra and the *pa-guru* of Ratna Kirti; but it does not seem quite right; because it is also written about the said Dharma Chandra that he was worshipped by 'Hamir Bhupal', and the reign of Hamir (Hammir) is found to have started from 1338 or 1342 AD and lasted till 1358 AD. (See, Ancient Dynasties of India, Part 1). In such a situation, the time of Prabhachandra becomes the 15th century AD, which contradicts the time of the *pattavali* and does not seem to be in accordance with the said inscription. Because the inscription mentions Acharya 'Amarakirti' as the disciple of Shubhakirti, Prabhachandra should be almost contemporary scholars of him and the inscription also mentions two or three generations of Amarakirti. One Acharya 'Amarakirti' composed a Prakrit text called 'Shatkarmaupadesh' in 1247 AD. If these are the same Amarakirti who were the disciples of Shubhakirti, then it makes the time of these Prabhachandra even clearer.

In the *pattavalis* and *gurvawalis*, while collecting the names of the Acharyas, there must have been some confusion due to the similarity of names, and it can only be corrected by good research. But for this, there is a great need for deep study as well as the availability of resources. The society is not paying any attention to this. 

Page #69:
---------------------------
This is supported by Belgol inscription No. 111 (274), which is dated Saka Samvat 1295. It is also found that there was a disciple of Shubhakeerti named 'Dharambhushan', whose lineage is mentioned in this inscription. Thus, these Prabhachandra were also scholars of the 13th and 14th centuries Vikram. The time of their enthronement given as Vikram Samvat 1310 in the list of Acharyas in the * Pattavali of Nandisingh published in the said 4th Kiran, is likely to be correct or their enthronement may have taken place even earlier. These Acharyas seem to have been long-lived, almost a hundred years old.
(16) Those Prabhachandra (Prabhendu) Muni who were accomplished in Ashtangayoga and who wrote a commentary on 'Charitrasar' in six thousand verses (lekhayitva) and dedicated it to Kalyanakeerti, a disciple of Maladhari Lalitakeerti, and whose mention is found in the last part of the Kannada commentary on the said Charitrasar in the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan Ara. Kalyanakeerti was present in Vikram Samvat 1488. He composed 'Yashodharacharitra' in Saka Samvat 1353 while staying in the Gommataswami Chaityalaya of Pandya Nagar - from this, these Prabhachandra were scholars of the latter half of the 15th century Vikram.
(16) Those Prabhachandra who were the pattashikshya of 'Dharmachandra', a disciple of 'Hemkeerti' Bhattarak, who belonged to the lineage of 'Nayasen' Acharya, and who wrote a commentary on Tattvarth Sutra named 'Tattvarth Ratnaprabhakar' at the request of Pandit Sonik, son of 'Sakaru' Sadhu (Sah) of Lambakunchuk (Lamechu?) Aamnay in Saket Nagar (Eta district). The time of composition of this commentary is given as Vikram Samvat 1489 in the copy of Karanja, as informed by Babu Hiralalji MA. From this, the time of these Prabhachandra also seems to be the 15th century Vikram.
(18) Those Prabhachandra who were the pattashikshya of Jinachandra B. who was established on the patt or prapatt of Padmanandi B., whose coronation took place at Sammed Shikhar, who were the padaguru of Dharmachandra, Dharmakeerti or Chandrakirti and who were knowledgeable in Devagamalankriti, Pramey Kamalmartand and Jainendraadi Lakshanashastras. _ * The same time is given in the 'Pattavali' published in the sixth part, issue 7-8 of Jain Hitaishi. 

Page #70:
---------------------------
It is written * that Prabhachandra was a scholar of the 16th century Vikram era; because a disciple of the said Jinachandra, Pandit Medhavi, completed the 'Dharmasangraha-Shravakachar' in Vikram Samvat 1541.
(19) He is the Prabhachandra whom 'Vadichandra' Surin, the author of the play 'Jnan Suryodaya', has written as his own guru and the disciple of Jnanabhusan. The said play was completed in Samvat 1648. From this, this Prabhachandra appears to be a scholar of the latter half of the 16th century Vikram era and the early part of the 17th century. ..
(20) All those Prabhachandra who have been the Acharyas of the Svetambar sect, and whose separate names and other details do not seem necessary here.
Of these scholars named 'Prabhachandra', the first four scholars did not write this commentary, because this commentary mentions the texts 'Pramayakamalmartand' and 'Nyayakumudchandrodya'. And all four Prabhachandra are before the creation of these two texts. The first Prabhachandra is a scholar even before the creation of the original text. This commentary was not written by the scholars from number 16 to 193; because all four Prabhachandra, who are scholars of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries Vikram era, are far behind Pandit Ashadharji and in Pandit Ashadharji's Anugardharmamatitika, which was completed in Vikram Samvat 1300, this commentary is mentioned as follows: _ As it is said there, Bhagavan Shrimat Prabhendudeva Pada Ratnakandakatika, in the 'Chaturavartatritaya' etc. sutra, in the explanation of 'Dvinisha', "Devavandana Kuvartahi Prarambhe Samaptou Chopavisya Pranamah Kartavya" iti.

Besides this, a copy of this commentary of the Ratnakarandaka is available in the Shastra Bhandar (Balatkaragan. Mandir) of Karanja, written in Vikram Samvat 1415 (Magha Sudi 7 Ravi Din), as it appears from the list which was recently compiled by B. Hiralalji M.A. by personally inspecting the manuscripts in the Bhandar and sent to us for our perusal. From this, it becomes even clearer that this commentary was not written by any Prabhachandra who lived after Vikram Samvat 1415. This commentary is also not written by any Svetambara Prabhachandra mentioned at number 20; because the belief of the Svetambaras regarding the Kevali Kavalahaar is specifically refuted in it (in the commentary of the sixth verse). There are many other things which suggest that this commentary is not written by any Svetambara Acharya. Now we should see which Prabhachandra Acharya, out of the remaining 5 to 15 scholars, wrote or could have written this commentary.

Some scholars believe that this commentary was written by the same Prabhachandra (No. 5) who is the author of the Pramey Kamal Martand and the Nyaya Kumud Chandrodya, and in support of their view, they often present the following sentence from the commentary: "Tadalamatiprasangena" Pramey Kamal Martande Nyaya Kumud Chandraye Prapanchata Prarupanaat.

They say that by this sentence, the commentator, while restricting the natural topic of Kevali Kavalahaar, has encouraged the reader to see its detailed explanation in his own works, "Pramey Kamal Martand" and "Nyaya Kumud Chandrodya". But there is no such regulatory word in this sentence from which it can be determined that the commentator has mentioned his own works in it. The clear meaning of the sentence is only that "since the Pramey Kamal Martand and Nyaya Kumud Chandra (Chandrodya) have a detailed explanation of the natural topic, there is no need to say more about it here, we are satisfied with what has been given" - it does not say anywhere that the explanation was given by me or that I am the author of those works. Yes, it is true that by such sentences, an author can mention another work of his own in his work, but in the same way, the works of other scholars are also mentioned by sentences, and it has often happened, two examples of which are given below. 

Page #72:
---------------------------
"And because it is supported by Vyasa in _Tathāptamīmāṃsā_." "Just as the arguments of the _Abhāvaikānta_ and other sides are refuted by the _Devāgamāptamīmāṃsā_ in a straightforward manner, so too should they be understood here. There is no need for further elaboration."
- _Yuktyanuśāsanatīkā_ . "And so on, the characteristics of Krishna and the other six _leśyā_ are explained in detail in the scriptures like _Gomata_ etc. That is not being said here."
- _Pañcāstikāyatīkā_ by Jayasenīya. In this situation, without the availability of any strong evidence, it cannot be concluded from the said statement alone that this commentary and the said both texts are created by the same person.
In this commentary, at one place, below the verse " _Varopaplipsyā_ ", these sentences are found:
"Now, if it is said that the worship of the _śāsanadevatā_ etc. by the _śrāvakas_ etc. would lead to the defilement of _samyagdarsana_ , then it is so if it is done with the desire for a boon. But when it is done to them as _śāsana-sakta-devatā_ , then it is not a cause of defilement. And those who do it, due to their partiality towards _darsana_ , even grant boons that are not requested. And if it is not done, then the attainment of fruit from the special _iṣṭadevatā_ (like _arhanta_ etc.) is not quickly and effortlessly achieved. For, it is not seen that the servants of a _cakravartī_ obtain fruit from the _cakravartī_ when they do not worship his family."
Regarding this part of the commentary, some other scholars believe that this commentary cannot be written by Prabhācandracārya, who is the author of _Prameyaka-malamārtaṇḍa_ etc. In their opinion, the statement made by these sentences that "the worship of the _śāsanadevatā_ etc. who are defiled by _rāga-dveṣa_ does not lead to the defilement of _samyagdarsana_ - it does not cause any defect in it - when it is done without any desire for a boon, simply considering them as _śāsana-bhakta-devatā_ "; and also, it has been stated that those _śāsanadevatā_ , due to their partiality towards _darsana_ - being partial to Jainism - grant boons to those _śrāvakas_ etc. who worship them even without being asked, and if they are not worshipped but the special _iṣṭadevatā_ (like _arhanta_ etc.) are worshipped, then the attainment of fruit from the special _iṣṭadevatā_ through that worship is not achieved quickly and effortlessly in the same way as the servants do not obtain fruit from the _cakravartī_ when they do not worship his family.

This statement is against the original scriptures and the relevant Agamas, and it is not logical. 
1
Mature scholars like the authors of Pramey Kamal Martanda, etc., do not expect such statements or such weak arguments from them, and therefore, their opinion is appropriate. There is no doubt that this statement of the commentary is highly objectionable, and the statement made in it about the attainment of fruits by worshipping the ruling deities is completely ignored from the theoretical point of view of Jain principles and is just like misleading children. Because, just as a Chakravarti is stained with attachment and aversion, has a finite family, is pleased to see the respect and honour of his family, listens to the words of his family members, accepts their recommendations, and willingly punishes or favours someone, the same situation does not apply to Arhanta, etc., the desired deities. Such things do not happen in them - they are free from attachment and aversion, their soul does not feel pleasure or displeasure at the worship or disregard of anyone, the ruling deities are not associated with them as a family, they do not listen to any recommendations of the ruling deities, and they do not willingly punish or favour anyone - the secret of fruit attainment by them is different. Apart from this, because the ruling deities are born in the world, they do not have the capacity to be worshipped by the devotees (Shravakas) from a religious point of view; being on the side of religion, they themselves should worship those who are established in a higher position than themselves in the religion of the Shravakas, not ask the Shravakas to worship them. As for the worship from the point of view of obtaining worldly blessings, even the commentary itself considers it to be corrupt; then from what point of view should they be worshipped, it is not understood at all. If they are worshipped from the point of view of being a fellow religionist or because of being on the side of Jainism, then all Jains become worthy of worship; then there is no special significance in the worship of the ruling deities. And it is not possible that any ruling deity can overturn the theory of karma or go against the theory of karma. 
* To get some experience of this secret of fruit attainment, one should refer to the 'Upasana Tattva' written by the author, which has been published by the Jain Granth Ratnakar Office. 

Page #74:
---------------------------
If someone were capable of preventing the fruits of karma from reaching an individual, or in other words, if they could prevent the inevitable results of the worship of an Arhantdeva due to their intense devotion, then their own lack of worship would be the cause. Therefore, the argument in favor of the worship of Shasana Devatas is weak and inappropriate, and it should be understood as merely an attempt to reconcile the worship of Shasana Devatas prevalent in society at that time with the original scriptures. However, if the subject of someone's faith is weak, then one must use weak arguments to support it. Therefore, it cannot be said solely on the basis of these statements that this commentary was not written by Prabhachandracharya, the author of "Pramayakamalmartad," or that it could not have been written by him. To prove this, it is necessary to show from the accepted works of the aforementioned Acharya (Pramayakamalmartad, etc.) that his views were against the worship of Shasana Devatas, or it must be proven through other means, such as an examination of the literature, that this commentary could not have been written by him. So far, nothing has come to light that reveals anything about the faith and views of these Acharyas regarding the worship of Shasana Devatas. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate this matter further through other means to determine whether this commentary could have been written by them or not.

"Pramayakamalmartad" and "Nyayakumudchandra" are both commentaries - one is a commentary on the "Parikshamukh" sutra by Srimanikyanandi Acharya, while the other is an explanation of the "Laghiyastray" text by Bhattakalankadeva. When these commentaries are compared with this commentary on the "Ratnakarandaka," a significant difference is found between them. The style of presentation - the way of speaking - and the literature are completely different from each other. There is no similarity between the initial and final verses of both, and there are no verses in the form of information about the subject discussed at the end of each chapter of the "Ratnakarandaka" commentary. The sophistication of the literature and the depth of meaning found in "Pramayakamalmartad," etc., are not present in this commentary. It is very clear that this commentary is almost devoid of discussions, while the commentaries like "Pramayakamalmartad," etc., have included discussions on almost every subject and are not like this commentary, which follows word-for-word translation or focuses primarily on it. All these differences between the two...

---------------------------
A good understanding of this can be easily gained from a comparative study of these commentaries, and therefore there is no need to elaborate on this topic here. Scholars who have studied these commentaries from a comparative perspective themselves acknowledge that there is a great disparity between the two. Pandit Vanshidharji Shastri, while editing the *Pramayamaalamartaanda*, has also written in its 'Upaddhaat' that the composition of this commentary is 'visadrushi' (different) from the composition of the *Pramayamaalamartaanda* - it does not have any similarity or correspondence with it. In such a situation, knowledgeable readers can themselves understand that when there is so much disparity between these commentaries, how can these three commentaries be created by the same person. And at the same time, they can also experience that if this commentary had been created by a mature scholar-acharya like the author of the *Pramayamaalamartaanda* etc., then it would definitely have some special qualities like the *Pramayamaalamartaanda* etc. - at least it would have taken up a good discussion of Shravak Dharma, which makes it appear almost empty at present. And at the same time, it would not have most of the errors that have been pointed out earlier. As far as we have examined the literature of this commentary, it does not appear to us to be created by Prabhachandracharya, the author of these *Pramayamaalamartaanda* etc.; its composition seems to have taken place much later than the composition of the *Pramayamaalamartaanda* etc. - after many centuries. This is clarified below with some specific evidence.

1. In this commentary, at one place, below the verse 'Navapunyai: Pratipatti:' etc., on the occasion of the explanation of the word 'Saptagunasamahitena', a verse is found quoted as follows:
* Yatha - 'Ratnakarandakabhidhasya Shrisamantabhadriyasravakacharyasya Brihatsvayambuustotrasya, Samadhishatakasya cha upari vivaranani ShriPrabhachandrenaiva vinirmitanani santi kintu tesham praneta sa eva apara va Prabhachandrastadanantaralabdhajanmeti na paryate'vadharayitumalam tathaapi pramayamaalamartaandapeckshya tavrittinam rachnatarangabhango visadrushiti vaktumutshe.'

"Shraddha, Tushti, Bhakti, Vijnana, Alupbdhata, Kshama, Shakti. 
Yasyai te Saptgunastam Dataram Prashamsanti." - "Ityetai: Saptbhirgunai: Samahitena Tu Datra Danam Datavyam." ..
This verse, which mentions the seven qualities of a giver, and which is followed by the commentary which states that 'the gift should be given by a giver who possesses these seven qualities,' is a verse from the 43rd 'Kalpa' of the Yashatilak text. The Yashatilak text, also known as 'Yashodhar Maharaj Charit', was written by Somadeva Suri and was completed in the Saka year 881 (Vikram Samvat 1016). This commentary is therefore later than the 'Yashatilak' or, to put it another way, it is almost two hundred and fifty years later than the 'Pramaye Kamal Martand'. There is no hesitation in saying this.
2. A part of the commentary on the verse called 'Aarambhasang', which explains the nature of the 'Dushruti' Anarthadanda, is as follows: "Aarambhacha Krishyaadi: Sangacha Parigraha: Tayo: Prapadanam Varta Neeti Vidhiyate 'Krishi: Pashupalya Vaanijyam Cha Varta' Ityabhidhanat."
The definition of 'Varta' which is quoted from another text and whose quotation is also indicated by the word 'Ityabhidhanat' is the first sutra of the 'Varta Samuddesha' of the 'Neeti Vakya Amrit' text. The phrase 'Neeti Vidhiyate' also suggests the indication of a Neeti text. This 'Neeti Vakya Amrit' was written by the same Somadevacharya who wrote the Yashatilak, and its composition is later than the Yashatilak text. Because its praise mentions the writing of the 'Yashodhar Maharaj Charit'. This commentary is therefore later than the 'Neeti Vakya Amrit'.
1. In its place, 'Satya' seems to have been printed by mistake; otherwise, the quality of truthfulness is not included in these qualities.
2. 'Yatraite' is also seen as a variant reading. 3. 'Pashupalanam' is a variant reading and this seems to be correct. 4. 'Vanijya' is a variant reading and this also seems to be correct.

3. In the commentary on the verse that describes the nature of giving, "Navapunyaiḥ pratipattiḥ," etc., the verse below is quoted with the words "Danam datavyam kaiḥ kṛtvā nava punyaiḥ," and then the words "Etai vāmeḥ punyaiḥ punyopaārjanahetu bhiḥ" are given, and in this way the word "navapunyaiḥ" is explained.

"Pāḍagahamucchaḥāṇam pādodaya maccaṇam ca paṇamam ca. Maṇavayaṇakāya suddhī esaṇasuddhi ya nava viham puṇṇam." This verse is from the "Upāsakādhyayana" scripture of Vasunandī Ācārya, which is also called "Vasunandī-Śrāvakācāra," and it is found at number 224. It seems that the commentator quoted this verse because he saw the use of the term "navapuṇṇam" in the original, which is in accordance with the original. Otherwise, he could have quoted the verse "Śraddhā tuṣṭiḥ," etc., from the Yaśastilka, and also the other verse "Pratigrahocasana," etc., which is associated with it. But in that verse, these nine things are called "navopacāra," which did not match the explanation of the word "navapunyaiḥ" here. Besides this, there was something else special. Therefore, the commentator deliberately left it out and preferred to give this verse instead. So, now we should see when Vasunandī, the author of the scripture from which this verse is taken, lived. In the eighth chapter of his commentary on the "Mūlācāra" scripture, "Ācāravr̥tti," Vasunandī, while describing the four types of "kāyoatsarga," gives five verses in the form of "uktam ca," "Syāgo dehamamatvasya tanūts. tirudāhr̥tā......ityādi," and at the end of them he writes, "Upāsakācāre uktamāste," meaning, this statement is from the "Upāsakācāra." This "Upāsakācāra" scripture, in whose eighth chapter these five verses are found in the same order, from number 57 to 61, was written by Śrī Amitagati Ācārya, who was a scholar of the 11th century Vikram era and who completed his "Dharmaparikṣā" scripture in Vikram Samvat 1070. The "Upāsakācāra" is also a scripture from around the same time. From this, Vasu... This complete verse is as follows:

"Pratimahōccāsana pāda pūjā praṇāma vākkāya manaḥ prasādāḥ. Vidyā viśuddhiś ca navopacārāḥ kāryā munīnām gṛha saṁśritena."

There is no difficulty in saying that Nandi Acharya lived after Vikrama Samvat 1070. However, it cannot be said exactly how long after. It can be said for sure that he lived before Pandit Ashadharji, because Pandit Ashadharji in his own commentary on 'Sagar Dharma Amrit', which was completed in Vikrama Samvat 1296, mentions the story of 'Panchumbar Sahyanai' from Vasunandi Shravakacharki, writing: - _ 'Iti Vasunandi Saiddhantimate Darshanpratimaayam Pratipannastasyedam. Tanmatenaiv Vratpratima Bibhrato Brahmananuvratam Syat Tadyatha - Pavvesu Isthiseva......।'
Besides this, in the commentary on 'Anangar Dharma Amrit', which was completed in Vikrama Samvat 1300, Ashadharji has also mentioned Vasunandi's Acharavrittika as follows:
'Etatch Bhagavad Vasunandi Saiddhantadeva Padair Achartikaayaam 'Duo Nadam Jahajadam' Ityadisatre Vyakhyatam Drishtvyam.'
In such a situation, Vasunandi Acharya should be a scholar of Vikrama's 12th or 13th century - somewhere between Vikrama Samvat 1070 and 1296. The Guru Parampara given in his Shravakachar shows that he was a disciple of 'Nemichandra' and a great-grand disciple of 'Nayanandi', and Nayanandi was a disciple of 'Shrinandi'. Mention of some donations given to Shrinandi is found in a broken Kannada inscription* from Gudigeri, which is dated Shaka Samvat 998, and it shows that 'Shrinandi' was present in Vikrama Samvat 1133. In such a situation, the time of his disciple (Nemichandra)'s disciple 'Vasunandi' is estimated to be the last part of the 12th century and possibly the beginning of the 13th century. Therefore, this commentary, which mentions Vasunandi's words, seems to have been written in the 13th century - almost four hundred years after 'Pramaye Kamal Martand' - and could not have been written by Prabhachanda Acharya, the author of 'Pramaye Kamal Martand'.

4. In the commentary on the verse "Dharmamritam Satashnah", while explaining the term "Jnana-Dhyana-Para", the following two verses are quoted:

Adhruva-Asharanechaiva Bhava-Ekatvam-Eva Cha | Anyasvam-Ashuchisvam Cha Tathaiva-Asrava-Samvarau ||1|| Nirjara Cha Tatha Loko Bodhi-Durlabha-Dharmata |
Dvadashaita Anupreksha Bhashita Jinapungavaih ||2||

These two verses are from the "Padmanandi-Upasaka-Achar", which is also found collected in the "Padmanandi-Panchavimshati". The author of this Upasaka-Achar, Shri Padmanandi Acharya, lived before Pandit Ashadharji. He should be considered a scholar of the latter half of the 12th century Vikram Samvat. He was a disciple of Shubhachandra Acharya, who passed away in Shaka Samvat 1045 (Vikram Samvat 1180). He also authored a work called "Ekatva-Saptaati", which is collected in the "Padmanandi-Panchavimshati" under the name "Ekatva-Ashiti". In the commentary on "Niyama-Sara" by Padmaprabha-Maladharideva, several verses from this work are quoted with the phrase "Tathachokta-Ekatva-Saptaatau", and all of them are found exactly as they are in the aforementioned "Ekatva-Ashiti". The following verse in "Ekatva-Ashiti" also mentions the name of this work as "Ekatva-Saptaati":

Ekasva-Saptaatiriyam Sura-Sindhur-Ucchah | Shri-Padmanandi-Hima-Bhudharatah Prasoota | Yo Gahathe Shiva-Pada-Ambunidhi-Pravista |
Metaam Labhet Sa Naraha Paramaam Vishuddhim || 77 ||

It is known that there are separate copies of "Ekatva-Saptaati" which have a special eulogy attached to them, in which "Nimba" is mentioned as "Samant-Chudamani". From this, - "Inscriptions at Shravanabelagola" (Epigraphia Carnatica, Volume Two), second edition (1923), preface

* Pandit Ashadharji, in the 9th chapter of his commentary on "Anugara-Dharmamrita", has quoted your verse "Mlane Kshalanatah" etc. with the phrase "Ata Eva Shri-Padmanandi-Padair-Api Sachalata-Dushanam Dingmatram Idam Adhi-Jage", which is found in the section called "Yatya-Achar-Dharma" within the "Padmanandi-Panchavimshati". . + For this time of death, see Shravanabelagola inscription no. 43 (117).  _See, "Padmanandi-Panchavimshati" published in Shaka Samvat 1820 by Gandhi Bahalchand Kasturchand Dharashiv.

I, the former-discourse-wise, learned Rao Bahadur Mr. R. Narasimhachar M.A. write that
He (Nimba Samanta) is praised as the crest jewel of Samantas in the Ekatvasaptati of Padmnandi a disciple of Subhachandra who died in 1123.
That is, in the Ekatvasaptati composed by Padmnandi, a disciple of Subhachandra who died in 1123 AD (Shaka Samvat 1045, Vikram Samvat 1180), Nimba Samanta is praised as the "crest jewel of Samantas".
From this, it appears that the Ekatvasaptati was composed around Vikram Samvat 1180. The mention of its verses also proves that this commentary was composed in the 13th century Vikram Samvat. No mention of this commentary is found in any text composed before the 13th century Vikram Samvat.
1
From all these evidences, it becomes absolutely clear and there is no doubt that this commentary was not composed by Prabhachandra, the author of Pramey Kamal Martanda, etc., and cannot be. It certainly contains some statements on the subject of "Kavalahaar" of Kevali, taking some verses from Pramey Kamal Martanda and Nyaya Kumud Chandra, and this has inspired to look at those texts for specific statements. But the commentator's intention is not at all that those texts were composed by him.
-
It is not composed by him and which is of the 13th
While this commentary is found to be of the 13th century Vikram Samvat - possibly of the middle period of this century - it can be easily said that this commentary was composed by those other Prabhachandra Acharyas whose mention has been made above from number 6 to 10, who are scholars of the period before the 13th century. Now it should be seen which Prabhachandra Acharya this commentary appears to be composed by among the remaining scholars from number 11 to 15. It does not appear to be composed by Raktambar Prabhachandra, who is number 14; because no special point is seen in it that supports the corruption of the Acharya. In the statement of the excellent Shravak, who is number 11, while explaining the word "Chelkhundadharah", it is not even written that the cloth should be "Rakta", and in the explanation of this word, only "Kopin Matravastra Khundadharah Aryalingadhari tyarthah" is written.

It could have been ordained in the Sahaja tradition; as Pandit Medhavi has ordained it in his 'Dharmasangraha Shravakaachar' by the term 'Raktakoupina Sangrahee'. If it is said that Prabhachandra became a Raktambar by corrupting himself in Samvat 1305, before that he was not corrupt, and this commentary was written before Samvat 1300, therefore this could be his work before becoming corrupt, there is definitely a possibility of that; but one thing is that the name of Prabhachandra's guru or pattaguru is not known, so there is no understanding of his separate existence - in 'Vidvajjanbodhak' the name of the king of Delhi is not even given, under whose order he wore blood-colored clothes or from whom he received special help. It may be that the said Samvat 1305 was written on the basis of some legend and it may not be correct. Secondly, even after becoming corrupt, he could have reversed a lot in his previous work according to his immediate thoughts, and it is found in most copies of this commentary. But it is not so, therefore this commentary does not seem to be written by the corrupt Raktambar Prabhachandra. Out of the remaining four Prabhachandras, the 11th and 13th number Prabhachandras seem to be scholars of South India - Karnataka country - and they both could be one, because the name of the guru of the 13th number Prabhachandra could not be known - it is possible that he is a disciple of 'Nayakirti'. The 12th and 15th number Prabhachandras were scholars of North India and they both could also be one person; because the name of the guru of the 12th number Dharanivasi Prabhachandra could not be known - it is possible that he is a pattashiष्य of 'Ratna Kirti', the pattadhish of Ajmer, and it is also possible that he was a disciple or pattashiष्य of some other Acharya in Dhar, he gained more fame there and later became the overlord of the Ajmer throne in some way. And from this, you may have started writing the epithet 'Dharanivasi' with your name from that time to give your previous fame-filled introduction.
* Ratna Kirti was the padadhisha of Ajmer, for this see the list of Acharyas of the Nandisingh pattavali published in Indian Antiquary, which is published in the 4th Kiran of Jain Siddhant: Bhaskar.

This previous possibility is more likely. There has always been harmony among the scholars of the Dharma. While residing in Dharma, Pandit Ashadharji had studied the Jainendra Vyakaran and other texts from Mahavir Acharya, the disciple of Dhar-Senacharya. It is not surprising that this Mahavir Acharya was the guru of Prabhachandra, a resident of Dharma, or that his discipleship was passed on to someone else. Thus, in our opinion, this commentary appears to have been written by Prabhachandra Acharya, number 153, who is described in the 'Gurvavali' as the one who explained the scriptures of Pujyapada. A commentary by Prabhachandra Acharya on the 'Samadhi Tantra' text of Shri Pujyapada Acharya, also known as 'Samadhi Shatak', is available and was published in 1912 with a Marathi translation. When this commentary is compared with that commentary, a great deal of similarity is found between the two. The style of presentation, the manner of expression, and the state of literature seem to be the same in both. It also, like this commentary, has mostly taken word-for-word translations. Both have the same verse at the beginning and end, and their writing style is also found to be similar in terms of their respective subject matter. Below, some examples are given as a sample to experience this similarity.
(1) The verses of the mangalacharan at the beginning of both commentaries are as follows:
Siddhāṁ jinendramalam pratima prabodhaṁ nirvāṇamārgamamalaṁ vibhudhendravandyaṁ |
Saṁsārasāgarasamuttarana prapotaṁ vakṣye samādhiśatakaṁ praṇipatya vīraṁ || 1 ||
- Samadhi Shatakatika.
Samantabhadraṁ nikhilātmabodhanaṁ jinaṁ praṇamyākhilakarmashodhanaṁ |
Nibandhanaṁ rasnakaraṇḍakaṁ paraṁ karoṁi bhavya pratibodhanākārakam || 1 ||
- Ratnakarandakatika.
These two verses are about the promise to comment on the text after saluting the desired deity. In both, the author and the original text have been made the subject of praise in different ways, and their *apratima prabodhaṁ-nikhilātmabodhanaṁ and nirvāṇamārga
*. In the first verse, the name of the author is mentioned by the word 'Jinenndra'. Because Pujyapada's other name is 'Jinenndra' or 'Jinenndra Buddhi'. And the word "Vibhudhendravandham" is also indicative of Pujyapada. 

Page #83:
---------------------------
79
Some adjectives like "Akhilkarma Shodhan" etc. are also similar in meaning.
(2) After the Mangalacharan, the introductory sentences of both the commentaries are as follows:
"Sri Pujyapada Swami, desiring to show the means of liberation and the nature of liberation to the seekers of liberation, wishing for the fruit of the completion of the scriptures, etc., salutes the particular deity he desires, and says..." - Samadhi Shataka Commentary.
"Sri Samantabhadra Swami, desiring to make the scripture called Ratnakarandaka, which is a means of protecting the jewels, a means of protecting the jewels of right faith, etc., wishing for the fruit of the completion of the scriptures, etc., salutes the particular deity he desires, and says..." - Ratnakarandaka Commentary.
There is no need to point out how much similarity there is in these two introductory sentences. It is self-evident.
(3) The summary of the first verse of the Samadhi Shataka commentary is as follows:
"Here, the first half shows the means of liberation, and the second half shows the nature of liberation."
And the summary of the first verse of the Ratnakarandaka commentary is as follows:
"Here, the first half shows the means of the omniscient, and the second half shows the omniscient."
This makes it clear that the style and word order of both commentaries are the same.
(4) The explanation of the word "Parameshti" in both commentaries is the same. For example:
"Parame Indraadi Vandye pade tishthati iti Parameshti sthansheelah."
"Parame Indraadi naam Vandye pade tishthati iti Parameshti."
- Samadhi Shataka Commentary.
(5) The last verses of both commentaries are as follows:
"Yenaatma bahirantaruttamabhidha tredha vivrutyodito mokshaananta chatushtaya malavapu sadhyanatah kirtitah."
"Jiyaatso'tra Jinah samasta vishaya shripada pujyo'malo bhavyanandakarah samaadhishatakah shrimati prabhendu prabhuh."
- Ratnakarandaka Commentary.
- Samadhi Shataka Commentary.

The entire path of the ocean, the path of liberation, is revealed by the rays of right knowledge, which destroys the darkness of ignorance and illuminates the mind of all beings. The radiant sun of the Jewel casket, the destroyer of the stream of transmigration, may this Samantabhadra Muni, the glorious Prabhendu, the Jina, live long. - Ratnakarandaka Commentary.

In these two verses, while summarizing the subject matter of their respective works, the method by which the Jina, the author (Sri Pada Pujya, Samantabhadra Muni), the work (Samadhi Shataka, Ratnakarandaka) and the commentator (Prabhendu - Prabhachandra) have been blessed is exactly the same in both. There is no difference at all in the style of presentation or writing of both, the meter of both is also the same and the unity of the words Yena, Jina, Sriman, Prabhendu, Sa, Jiyat, and the similarity in the use of words like Kirtita, Prakatita, etc. found in both is evident from the original verses themselves, there is no need to explain it further.

From all this statement regarding the similarity, the reader can easily infer that both these commentaries were written by the same scholar and that scholar appears to be the one who is mentioned in the said Guruvali with the epithet 'Pujyapadaya Shastra Vyakhya Vikhyata Kirti' - that is, Prabhachandra, the disciple of Ratna Kirti. If the time of Prabhachandra's Patta Arohan (1310 AD) given in the Pattavali is correct, then in such a situation, it will have to be said that he wrote this commentary while he was in the position of another Acharya in Dharam before this Patta Arohan, and its composition either took place after 1292 AD and before 1300 AD, during the reign of Jayasimha II, or it seems to have been written even earlier during the reign of Jayasimha's father, Devpaldev, whose reign is known to have lasted from 1275 AD to 1292 AD. Pandit Ashadharji completed his commentary on Sagar-Dharmamrut in 1296 AD, there is no mention of this commentary anywhere in it, but it is definitely mentioned in the latter part of your Anugar Dharmamrut commentary written in 1300 AD. From this, it can be said that either this commentary was written before 1296 AD or 
* See, 'Ancient Dynasties of India', Part I, pp. 160, 161.

It was not created, or it was not available to Pandit Ashadharji. Otherwise, he would have definitely mentioned it in his commentary on Sagardharmamrita, at least he would have given space to the logic of the worship of the Shasana Devatas in this commentary, which has been mentioned above. But far from giving it space in support of the said worship, he has instead prohibited the worship of the Shasana Devatas for the first pratima Shravak and has clearly written that even when he is overwhelmed by calamities, he never worships them, but keeps his eyes only on the feet of the Panchparameshthis, as follows:
"Parameshthipadaikadhee: Parameshthipadaishu ahandaadipanchagurucharaneshueka dheerantadrishtiyasya. Aapadakulitoapi darshanikastanivrityartha shasandevatadeen kadachidapi na bhajate." _In this regard, we only want to say that not mentioning the logic of the worship of the Shasana Devatas is not a regulatory or necessary consequence of the fact that this commentary was not available to Ashadharji at that time, because even after it became available later, he did not mention that logic in the commentary on Sagardharmamrita; rather, while explaining the following verse, he has categorized the Shasana Devatas as Kudevas and declared them to be Avandaniya (unworthy of worship) at the doors of the Shravaks:
Shravakenapi pitarau guru rajaapyasanyataha.
Kulinginah kudevascha na vandyaha sopi sanyataih || Tika-.........Kulinginastapaasadayah parshvasthadayasch. Kudeva rudraadayah shasandevataadayasch. ......
In such a situation, it is thought that Ashadharji considered the said logic to be completely useless and insignificant and against his own opinion, and therefore did not quote it in any of his commentaries. But still, the fact that this commentary is not mentioned at all in the commentary on Sagardharmamrita - at least as a way of showing a difference of opinion - does not even show that Prabhachandra, unlike other Acharyas, has mentioned 11 pratimaas as 11 medas of the Sallekhanaanuchhata Dhavak in this commentary - it definitely raises some doubts. And therefore, it is not surprising that this commentary may not have been created before VS 1296. Or, if it was created and became available, it is also possible that

While residing in the Dhārā region and being influenced by the Dhārā Bhatṭārakas, Āśādhara may have considered it against his etiquette and ethics to directly oppose this immediate work due to any wrong thing. However, in both cases, whether before 1296 or after, this commentary appears to have been written during the time of Paṇḍit Āśādhara.

However, if the aforementioned commentary on 'Samādhiśataka' was not written by Ratna Kīrti's successor or Prabhācandra, a resident of Dhārā, or if this mention of the lineage and succession in relation to Ratna Kīrti's successor Prabhācandra is incorrect, then this commentary must have been written by Prabhācandra, the 113th disciple of 'Naya Kīrti', or Prabhācandra, the 13th Vidya Guru of 'Śruta Muni'. The time of both is also almost the same. Therefore, regardless of who wrote this commentary among these four Prabhācandras, as proven above, there is no doubt that it was not written before the 13th century Vikram Samvat.

It seems appropriate to reveal here that it is said about Dr. Bhāṇḍārkar and Mr. Peterson that they have written this commentary as being written by Prabhācandra, who lived in 1316 VS. Although, these reports of these scholars are not before us, nor is it known which Ācārya they have written this Prabhācandra as a disciple of, which provides an opportunity for special consideration; yet, it is clear that their intention in writing this could never be that they wrote this commentary as being written in 1316 VS or that it indicated that these Prabhācandras did not exist in the years before 1316 VS. It is possible that the clear time of its composition, 1316 VS, was given in the praise of some work written by these Prabhācandras, and from that, they were given the name Prabhācandra, who lived in 1316. Prabhācandra, the 15th, about whom there is a special presumption of this commentary being his, was present in 1316 VS. The possibility of Prabhācandra, the 12th and 133rd, being present at that time is also found. In such a situation, there is no difference in their writing from what has been decided here. Therefore.

Acknowledgement and Request. _ Now, concluding this introduction, we express our heartfelt gratitude to all the scholars whose books, articles or letters have helped us in any way in writing this 'Introduction' and the historical essay (history) called 'Swami Samantabhadra'. At the same time, we consider it appropriate to state that the special credit for writing this introduction, etc. goes to the worthy minister of the Granthamala, Suhridvar Pandit Nathuramji Premi, whose inspiring encouragement prompted us to undertake this work, and as a result of which we have been able to present this introduction and history to the readers. It has been more than a year since the introduction was started, during which time, in addition to illness and the resulting weakness, the scarcity of resources and the complexity of historical questions, etc., forced us to put it down many times and get involved in the work of collecting resources, etc. We stayed in Delhi for twenty-two days and saw many volumes of Epigraphia Carnatika, and also corresponded with many scholars, especially. While taking up the introduction, it was not understood that all this work would require so much effort and time, or that it would have to be given such a vast form. At that time, it was generally assumed that we would be able to complete it in two or three months. And perhaps on this hope, Premiji had also issued a notice about the printing of the book at that time, due to which he received many demands for the book and people repeatedly demanded it from him. But despite all this, Premiji was not discouraged by the unexpected and unavoidable delay on this side, nor did he, out of frustration at the repeated writing and demands of the people, consider it appropriate to publish this book without the introduction, etc.; rather, he kept the pages of the book printed as they were, and he continued to encourage us with loving words to complete the introduction, etc. as soon as possible; the result of which is that today he has been able to succeed in his inspiration. If Premiji had not worked with so much patience, this introduction would not have been possible today. 

Page #88:
---------------------------
It is indeed doubtful whether the forest and history could be presented before the readers in their present form. And for this reason, we give special credit for their writing to Premeji.  Inspired by your motivation, we have been able to write the sacred history of great men like Swami Samantabhad and express some of our thoughts on their scriptures, etc., which is a matter of great joy for us and for which we are especially grateful to Premeji. On this occasion, we cannot remain silent without thanking the renowned and experienced Rajavaidya Pandit Sheetal Prasadji of Delhi, who kept us with him with great love and selflessly treated us, and due to whose true medical treatment we have been able to regain our lost strength to a great extent, and this work is the first fruit of it. There is no doubt that some scholars must have suffered from the wait due to the delay in the publication of the book because of us, for which we are sorry ourselves and therefore we seek their forgiveness for it. Apart from this, we also request research-loving scholars that if we have made any mistake in writing this preface, etc., they should kindly take the trouble of writing it to us with evidence.  Enough said. Sarsawa, District Saharanpur) Date 17-2-1925

श्रीमत्समन्तभद्रस्वामिने नमः।
Swami Samantabhadra.
Preface.
In the Jain community, the seat of Bhagwan Samantabhadra Swami is very high among the brilliant Acharyas, capable scholars and revered "Mahatmas". Perhaps only a few unfortunate Jains will not have heard your holy name; but the majority of the society is certainly very unfamiliar with your pure qualities and holy life stories, or rather, unfamiliar. It is very disturbing that the society is so ignorant about its great leader and such a leader who has been written as "the founder of the Jina religion". We have been wanting for a long time to remove this ignorance of the people by writing a true history of Acharya Mahoray - a complete account of his life. But even after trying a lot, we have not been able to fulfill that desire yet. . 1 See the inscription No. 108 (new No. 258) of Shravanabelagola.

Swami Samantabhadra. The main reason for this is the lack of sufficient resources. Society, through its negligence, has lost much of its historical material, but what remains is not insignificant. However, it is so disorganized and scattered, and there are so many obstacles to knowing and obtaining it, that its existence is almost non-existent. It is neither used by the authorities themselves nor given to others for use, and therefore its gradual destruction (loss) continues, which is a matter of great sorrow! Due to this scarcity of resources, research and examination of historical facts sometimes face great difficulties and obstacles stand in the way. There have been many scholars with the same name; one scholar Acharya has had many names or surnames due to differences in birth, initiation, quality-proof and country-proof, etc. _1 For example, there have been many Acharyas who have borne the names 'Padmanandi' and 'Prabhachandra'. There have been many scholars who have borne the name 'Samantabhadra', some of whom were called 'Laghu' or 'Chik', some 'Abhinava', some 'Gerusoppé', some 'Bhattarak' and some 'Grihastha' Samantabhadra. Some information about the time of all these is given in the introduction of the Ratnakaranḍakaśrāvakācārya written by the author, under the heading 'Doubt about the text'. Swami Samantabhadra was different from all these and he lived long ago.
2 For example, 'Padmanandi' was the first initiation name of Kundakunda Acharya and later 'Kondakunda Acharya' became his country-proof name; because he was a resident of 'Kondakundapur'. In the Gurvalis, your Elacharya, Vakragriva and Grdhrapichcha Acharya are also mentioned, which should be understood as being taken for quality etc. proof and there have been other Acharyas with these names.

## Preface

And other scholars have mentioned him in their works by whatever name they chose; a single name often has many synonyms, and scholars and acharyas are also mentioned by these synonyms or partial synonyms; in translations into many different languages, sometimes the names of the original text and the author are also translated, or these names are mentioned in the translated form in the texts of those languages; the other names, surnames, synonyms, or translated names of one person may also be the original names of other persons, and often have been; the same is often true of the names of contemporary persons; some scholars have been disciples of many acharyas, and they have declared themselves to be disciples of whichever acharya they wished, wherever they wished; a good acharya of one sangha or gachchha has also been adopted by another sangha or gachchha, and he has been declared to be the acharya of their own sangha and gachchha. In the same way, some acharyas have been the heads of many monasteries or the masters of the thrones of many places, and this has resulted in many pattasishyas, each of whom has declared them to be their own pattaguru. In such situations, how difficult it is to find out someone's real name and real work, and how much confusion there is for a historical scholar to decide on the actual state of affairs or to connect a particular event or mention with a particular person.

1. For example, Nagachandra is sometimes mentioned as 'Nagachandra' and sometimes as 'Bhujangasudhakar', this being a synonym. And Prabhachandra's partial synonym Prabhendu is used quite often.

## Swami Samantabhadra

Only those scholars who have had the opportunity to work in the historical field for some time can truly understand the difficulties faced. Thus, without sufficient resources, we have undertaken research on Swami Samantabhadra, despite the many difficulties, complexities, and challenges we have encountered. We have gathered information from his works, references in other scholars' texts, inscriptions, and our own experiences. It seems appropriate to publish this collected information now, without waiting for more resources. Therefore, we present the following:

##  Family and Guru

Very little is known about Swami Samantabhadra's childhood or his life as a householder. We do not even know the names of his parents. However, an ancient manuscript of his "Aapta Mimamsa" on palm leaves is found in the collection of Daurabli Jinadas Shastri in Shravanabelagola. At the end of this manuscript, it is written:

"Iti Phanimanadalalankarasya Uragapuradhipasunoḥ Śrīsvāmisamantabhadramunēḥ Kṛtau Āptamīmāṁsāyām."

This indicates that Samantabhadra was born into a Kshatriya lineage and was a prince. His father was the ruler of "Uragapura" within the Phanimanḍala region.

1. See Jain Hitaishi, Part 11, Issue 7-8, Page 480. A similar manuscript on palm leaves is also found in the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan in Ara.

Paternal and Guru lineage.
The king was, and therefore, you should consider Uragapur as your birthplace or childhood playground. In the 'Rajavali Kathe', your birth is written in the village of 'Utvatika', which is probably within Uragapur itself. This Uragapur seems to be the Sanskrit or euphonious name of 'Uraiyoor', which was the most ancient historical capital of the Chola kings. Old Trichinopoly is also called the same. This city was situated on the banks of the Kaveri, was a port, and at one time was a very prosperous region. Samantabhadra created a work rich in ornamentation called 'Stutividya' or 'Jinastuti Shatam', also known as 'Jinshatak' or 'Jinshatakalankaar'. The last verse of this work, called 'Gatvakastutameva', is a pictorial poem that carries the name of the poet and the poem. From the pictorial composition of this poem, which has six arrows and nine rings, these two verses emerge:
'Santivarmakritam', 'Jinastuti Shatam'. These clearly indicate that this work was created by 'Santivarma', and therefore, 'Santivarma' is another name for Samantabhadra. However, this name cannot be from his monastic life; because monks do not have 'Varmanta' names. It seems that this is the name given by the learned Acharya's parents, etc. 
1. The great poet Kalidasa also mentions this city by the name 'Uragapur' in his 'Raghuvansha'.
2. This name is found in the initial invocation of the work, in the pledge statement 'Stutividyam Prasadhaye'.
3. See the 'Jinshatak-Tika' by the great poet Narasimha. 

Page #94:

Swami Samantabhadra.
Rakkha was the auspicious name of his birth. This name also reveals his Kshatriya lineage. This name is of royal families. In the Kadamba, Ganga and Pallava dynasties, many kings have taken the name Varman. There was also a king named 'Shantivarma' in the Kadambas.
Here, there is no need for anyone to suspect that the text 'Jinastuti Shatam' was not written by Samantabhadra but by some other scholar named Shantivarma; because this text is undeniably considered to be written by Swami Samantabhadra. The name of Samantabhadra is mentioned as the author in the copies of the text, the commentator Mahakavi Narasimha also indicated it as 'Tarkik Chudamani Srimat Samantabhadracharya Virchit' - and other Acharyas and scholars have also mentioned his verses in their texts, in the name of Samantabhadra. For example, take 'Alankar Chintamani', in which Ajit Sena Acharya has quoted many verses of this text as evidence with the following pledge:
Srimat Samantabhadra Ayajina Senadi Bhashitam.
Lakshyamatram Likhami Svanamasuchitalakshanam.
Apart from this, Pandit Jinadas Parsvanathji Fadkule, in the edition of 'Swayambhu Stotra' published by him with Sanskrit commentary and Marathi translation, has introduced Samantabhadra by stating that in a copy of 'Ashta Sahasri' located in Karnataka, the name of the Acharya is mentioned as follows: "Iti Phanimanadalalankarasya Uragapuradhipasunan Shanthivarmanaama Shri Saman

Tabhdren. "If this information from Panditji is true, then it further clarifies that Shantivarma was indeed the name of Samantabhadra.
Indeed, it is through such important poetic works that Samantabhadra's poetic fame has spread throughout the world. You are the appropriate recipient of the pure stream of devotion that you have poured out in this work, using unparalleled wordplay.  Different from you - seeing this information from Pandit Jindas, we wanted to find out from him through a letter which copy of the Ashta Sahasri was found in the Karnataka region, and in which repository it is found, where the aforementioned mention is found. Because this mention is somewhat different from the mention found in the 'Apt Mimamsa' from the repository of the weak Jindas Shastri. In response, you informed us that this mention was taken from the preface of the Ashta Sahasri written by Pandit Vanshidharji, therefore this question should be asked of him. Upon looking at the preface (introduction) of the Ashta Sahasri, it was found that the aforementioned mention from 'iti' to 'Samantabhadren' is found exactly as it is, with the words 'Karnatadeshato labdha pustake' at the beginning and 'ityadyullekho drshyate' at the end. On this, a registered letter was sent to Pandit Vanshidharji in Sholapur on July 11th, requesting him to clarify his aforementioned mention. It was also written that 'if you have not personally seen the book found in the Karnataka region, then please inform us of the basis on which you made the aforementioned mention.' A second reminder letter was also sent on August 3rd, 1924, but Panditji did not have the kindness to reply to either of them.
No other support for this mention was found anywhere. In such a situation, this mention seems somewhat doubtful. It is not surprising that this mention was made based on the wrong memory of the mention of the 'Apt Mimamsa' published in Jain Hitaishi, because there are other incorrect mentions in the aforementioned preface, such as mentioning the verse 'Kanchyan nagnatako'ham' as being from the Mallisena Prasastika, which is not its verse.

Swami Samantabhadra.
There has been no other famous scholar. Therefore, the said doubt seems to be unfounded. Yes, it can be said that Samantabhadra must have composed this book before his monastic life. But there is no support for this from the literature of the book. The Acharya, in this book, has displayed his culmination and the emotional form, from which your work seems to be of the monastic state. Such profound and highly emotional original compositions cannot be made while living in the household and doing royal work. To decide on this matter, while reading the entire book with attention, verses no. 19, 79 and 114 * should be brought to mind especially. From the 19th verse itself, it becomes known that Swami had become a refuge of the Vitrag Bhagwan, taking the body (leaving all other possessions) when he was afraid of the world, and your conduct at that time (at the time of writing the book) was pure, excellent, and as excellent or flawless as the conduct of the Ganadharas etc. That verse is as follows:
Puta-svanavamacharam tanvayatam bhayadrucha.
Swaya Vamesha paya ma natamekaachyasambhav || In this verse, Samantabhadra has given two special adjectives of his own (the words 'ma' and 'mam') in the form of 'Puta-svanavamachar' + and 'bhayat 4 tanvayatam'
* This verse is quoted further under the heading 'Future Tirthankar'.    + 'Putah pavitrah su sustu anavamah ganadharadyanusthitah aacharah papakriyanivrittir yasya sau putah svanavamacharah -iti tika.
x Bhavat sansarbhiteh. Tanva shareeren (sah) ayatam agatam. 

Page #97:
---------------------------
Paternal and Guru lineage. In the same way, in the 79th verse, they have mentioned themselves by the epithet 'Dhvansamanasamanastatraasamanasan'. This epithet reveals that although there was no complete destruction (absence) of fear and anxiety in Samantabhadra's mind - it was definitely present to some extent - it had become like something that is about to be destroyed, and therefore it was not capable of disturbing or frightening his mind. Such a state of mind is achieved at a very high level, and therefore this epithet also indicates the excellent state of Samantabhadra's monastic life and reveals that this text was composed during his monastic life. The commentator Narasimhabhatta, in addition to writing "Shrisamantabhadraacharyavirachit" in the introduction to the first verse, has also indicated the same by interpreting the epithet 'Riddham' appearing in the 84th verse as 'Vridhdham', and by giving the meaning of the word 'Vandibhutvatah' in the 115th verse as 'Mangalapathaki bhutvatoapi nagnaacharyarupena bhavatopi mam'. Thus. There is almost no means of knowing whether Swami Samantabhadra entered the household life and got married or not. However, if it can be proved that King Shantivarma of the Kadamba dynasty and Shantivarma Samantabhadra were the same person, then it can be easily said that you had taken up the household life and had also got married. Along with this, it can also be said that the name of your son + This entire verse is as follows:

Swami Samantabhadra.
His grandfather was Mrigeshavarma, his great-grandfather was Ravivarma, his great-great-grandfather was Harivarma, and his father's name was Kakutsthavarma; because the donation deeds of Kakutsthavarma, Mrigeshavarma and Harivarma, which are found in the places of Halsi and Vaijayanti, given to the Jains or Jain institutions, reveal this lineage * . There is no doubt that the ancient Kadamba kings were mostly Jains and were the kings of the southern (Banavasa) country; but from this alone, due to the similarity of names, it cannot be said that Shantivarma Kadamba and Shantivarma Samantabhadra were the same person. Some special means and evidence are needed to prove that they are the same person, which are currently lacking. In our opinion, even if Samantabhadra got married, he did not stay in the household for a long time, he took monastic vows at a young age, and only then could he have attained the extraordinary ability and importance that is found in his works and in the mentions of him in the works of other scholars, which will be shown later. It seems that Samantabhadra had dedicated himself to Jainism and the service of the Jinadeva from childhood, he had a natural love for them, and every fiber of his being was devoted to their stories. In such a situation, it can be expected that he would have delayed leaving home.

Paternal and Guru-kula. They were and lived a religious life; they were not even allowed to stay in their native state for a long time. * And this was a practice that religious institutions in India, especially in Buddhist India, presented to younger sons. By falling into this practice, capable Acharyas sometimes gained more fame than their royal brothers. It is possible that Samantabhadra also had to go through such a situation; his elder brother may have been the ruler, he may have received the throne on the death of his father, and therefore Samantabhadra may not have ruled or married; but understanding his situation, he may have molded his life into a religious mold from the beginning; and on the death of his father or before that, he may have been initiated; and perhaps this is the reason why his going to Uragapura again and staying there is rarely found. But whatever it may be, there is no doubt that there was not even a hint of artificiality in your religious culmination. You are naturally

Swami Samantabhadra.
He was a righteous soul and he had taken *Jindiksha* inspired by the voice of his inner conscience.

Before his initiation, his education either took place in Uraiyur or it seems to have taken place in Kanchi or Madurai. All three of these places were centers of learning in South India at that time and all of them had good Jain monasteries which served as large schools and educational institutions at that time.
His place of initiation seems to be Kanchi or a village near it and Kanchi itself - which is also called 'Kanjeevaram' - seems to have been the center of his religious endeavors. He was a 'Digambar Sadhu' from there. This is also implied by his statement 'Kanchyaan nagnaatko'sahan'. There are also mentions in the 'Rajavali Kathe' that he went to Kanchi many times.
* The acceptance of *Samyak Charitra* with *Samyagdarshan* and *Samyaggyan* is called 'Jindiksha'. Samantabhadra had found the qualities of the character of Jinendradev to be justified by his examination and with an amazing rise, and therefore he was very happy to accept it and became engrossed in the true service and devotion of Jinendradev. - The following verse also reflects this sentiment of his

Paternal lineage and Guru lineage. Like the paternal lineage, there is rarely any clear mention of their Guru lineage, nor is it known what the name of your Diksha Guru was. Their own texts do not contain any praises of them, nor have other scholars shed any light on their Guru lineage. However, it is known that you were among the chief Acharyas of the 'Mula Sangh'. The 14th century Vikram era scholar-poet 'Hastimalla' and 'Ayyappary' have described you as the moon of the Mula Sangh sky, using the epithet 'Shrimulasanganhyonendu'. Apart from this, some inscriptions from Shravanabelagola reveal that you are a descendant of the lineage of great Acharyas like Shri Bhadrabahu Shruta Kevali, his disciple Chandragupta, Chandragupta Muni's descendant Padmanandi, also known as Shri Kondakunda Muni Raj, his descendant Umaswati, also known as Grdhrapichcha Acharya, and Grdhrapichcha's disciple Balakapichcha. As follows:

Shri Bhadras Sarvatoyoh hi Bhadrabahu iti Shruta.
Shruta Kevalinathaishu charamah paramo muni. || Chandraprakashojjvala sandra kirti Shri Chandragupto'jani tasya shishyah. Yasya prabhavadvanadevataabhiraraadhitah swasya gano muninaam.

From Samantbhadra, by virtue, arose the lion of the debate, Samantbhadra. Inscription No. 40 (64). In this inscription, just as Chandragupta is indicated as the disciple of Bhadrabahu and Balakapichcha as the disciple of Umasvati, in the same way, it is not indicated who the disciples of Samantbhadra, or Kundakunda and Umasvati Acharyas were. The situation is almost the same with other inscriptions. And from this, it is known that either the writers did not know the names of the gurus of these Acharyas, or those gurus had become so obscure at that time in front of the fame of their disciples that the writers did not have the inclination to mention their names, or they did not consider it necessary. It is possible that due to their special indifferent culmination by those gurudev, the work of literary service was very less and this very thing became the reason for their obscurity after the passage of time. But whatever it may be, there is no doubt that in this inscription, and in other similar inscriptions as well, the way in which the name of Samantbhadra is given after some selected Acharyas, it is absolutely clear that Swami

The paternal lineage and the guru lineage. Samantabhadra was one of the most special Acharyas. His fame transcends his guru lineage or gana gaccha; it even surpasses his paternal lineage. And therefore, due to the lack of evidence, if we don't know his guru lineage etc. completely, it's alright; we should leave that concern here and now focus our attention on the qualities of the Acharya. We should try to understand what special qualities he possessed and what service he rendered to religion, country, and society.
_ * In the second inscriptions of Shravanabelagola, and also in the inscriptions of other places, Kundakunda is written as the Acharya of Nandigana and Deshiya gana. Being in the lineage of Kundakunda, Samantabhadra is considered to be the Acharya of Nandigana or Deshiya gana. But in the list of Senagana published in Jain Siddhanta Bhaskar, he is mentioned as the Acharya of Senagana. Although this list is not written in the proper format of a list and it does not mention all the Acharyas in order. Still, it is clear that it includes Samantabhadra among the Acharyas of Senagana. Contrary to these two, the inscription number 108 states that this four-fold division of the sangha, due to the differences of Nandi and Sena etc., arose after the ascension of Bhattakalankdeva to heaven. And therefore, Samantabhadra is neither of Nandigana nor of Senagana; because he lived long before Akalankdeva. In the literature before Akalankdeva, there is no mention of these four types of ganas. In Indranandi's 'Nitisara' and inscription number 105, 'Arhadvali' Acharya is written as the founder of these four sangha; but all this literature is much later than Akalankdeva. Besides this, inscription no. 105 in Tirumakudalu-Narasipur taluk (E.C. III) mentions Samantabhadra as a scholar of the Arungal branch (Anvaya) of Nandi sangha under the Damil sangha. In such a situation, the reader can understand for themselves how confused the matter of Samantabhadra's gana gaccha etc. is.

##  Introduction to the Qualities

The inscription above, using the epithet "Gunato Ganish", indicates that Samantabhadra was a "Ganin" (a leader of the Sangha) and an "Acharya" (a spiritual teacher) who was revered as a "Ishvara" (Lord) or "Swami" (Master) due to his exceptional qualities. It also mentions that he was "Samantaat Bhadra" - benevolent in all directions, both internally and externally. This implies that he was a person of good conduct, speech, appearance, vision, purpose, compassion, and interaction. Consequently, those who came into contact with him were also transformed into virtuous individuals. 

Perhaps it was due to these very qualities that he was given the name "Samantabhadra" at the time of his initiation, or he became known by this name due to his exceptional nature. This name could be considered a "Gunapratyay" (a name signifying his qualities). 

There is no doubt that Samantabhadra was a great Yogi, a renunciant, an ascetic, and a knower of the truth. His benevolent form, radiant vision, and profound wisdom were capable of humbling even the most arrogant. He was always immersed in meditation and study, diligently working to dispel the ignorance of others, guiding them towards the right path, and helping them progress on the path of self-improvement. 

Beyond being a master of Jainism and its principles, he was also proficient in logic, grammar, prosody, rhetoric, and the treasury of poetry. His extraordinary brilliance encompassed almost all branches of knowledge and science. Although he was a scholar fluent in Sanskrit, Prakrit, Kannada, Tamil, and other languages, he was particularly adept in Sanskrit. 

*The word "Bhadra" is used in various contexts to signify auspiciousness, prosperity, goodness, excellence, virtue, pleasantness, safety, happiness, and compassion.*

Your exceptional affection and love, and the extraordinary abilities you attained in them, are not hidden from scholars. The very 'science of praise' itself indicates your unique mastery of words, or your dominion over words. All your works that have been available so far are in Sanskrit. But this should not lead anyone to believe that you did not compose works in other languages, for you surely did; because all the ancient poets of the Kannada language, in their Kannada poems, have praised you profusely as an excellent poet. * And since you were born in the Tamil country, Tamil was your mother tongue. It is natural for you to have composed works in it. Nevertheless, your indelible mark was on Sanskrit literature. In South India, your name is particularly mentioned among those who encouraged, promoted, and disseminated high-quality Sanskrit knowledge. From your time, a special era begins in the history of Sanskrit literature X; and it is through this that your name is immortal in the history of Sanskrit literature. Indeed, your knowledge has illuminated the whole of India once. At a time when the Buddhists, etc., were

Ramaswami Aiyangar, M.A., in his book 'Studies in South Indian Jainism', based on the Bombay Gazetteer, Volume 1, Part 2, page 406, writes that "Samantbhadra's appearance in South India marks an epoch not only in the annals of Digambar Tradition, but also in the history of Sanskrit literature."

Swami Samantabhadra.
A strong terror was looming, and people were terrified by their nihilism, skepticism, and transience doctrines—they were panicking—or they were being forced to commit suicide by falling into those solitary caves. At that time, the service you rendered to the people in South India, after emerging there, is of great importance and memorable. And therefore, what Shubhachandracharya has written about you as "Bharatbhushan" seems very reasonable. _ Swami Samantabhadra, although, was the master of many excellent qualities, yet the four qualities named poetry, music, debate, and eloquence were of extraordinary caliber in you. All these four powers had developed in you in a special way—and because of them, your pure fame spread far and wide. At that time, all the debaters, orators, poets, and musicians were overshadowed by your fame.

## Introduction to Qualities

Your fame, like a jewel on the crown, was supreme and has been revered by great scholars and great Acharyas even after your time. As evidenced by the following verse from the learned Bhagavajinaseenacharya, who lived eleven hundred years ago:

> "Among poets, storytellers, debaters, and eloquent speakers, the fame of Samantabhadra is like a jewel on the crown." (44) - Adipurana

To give you some idea of the impact of Samantabhadra's debating skills, poetry, and other qualities on the world, here are some examples:

(1) Vadirajsuri, the author of Yashodharacharita and a scholar of the 11th century, refers to Samantabhadra as the "mountain of excellent poetic jewels" and expresses the sentiment that he is the one who provides us with a collection of jewels in the form of verses.

> "May the excellent Samantabhadra and others, the mountains of poetic jewels, always be with us, providing us with a collection of jewel-like verses." (2) - Jnanarnava

(2) Yogi Shubahchandracharya, the author of the Jnanarnava, remembers Samantabhadra with the epithet "Kavindra-Bhaswan" (Sun among poets) and writes that those who are proficient in explaining things clearly are called "Gamakas."  "Nischyatamak" (conclusive), "Pratyayajanak" (generating conviction), and "Sanshayachedi" (dispeller of doubts) are other names for the same.

Along with this, he feels that the Mahakavishvara should be pleased with me, a seeker of poetry - meaning, his knowledge should shine in my heart and make my desires successful.

It also reveals that due to the influence of Samantabhadra, this entire earth became devoid of the talk of the Durvadakas - no one speaks their words.

##  The Character of Samantabhadra

Samantabhadra, who roamed freely without any restrictions, was a master of extraordinary knowledge. His eloquence, poetry, and other powers were highly developed, as is evident. His words, like a thunderbolt, shattered the peaks of opposing doctrines. In other words, before Samantabhadra, even the most formidable opposing doctrines had little prestige, and their proponents could not stand before him with their heads held high.

**Verse:**

"Samantabhadra, the foremost of the Munis, roamed freely in the realm of Saraswati. They triumph, their words like thunderbolts, shattering the peaks of opposing doctrines."

**From the inscription No. 108 at Shravanabelagola, dated Saka 1355 (new number 258), Mangarajakavi states that Samantabhadra was the "founder of the Jina religion" after Balakapichcha. He was "Bhadramoorti" and his words, like a thunderbolt, shattered the mountains of his opponents. No opponent could stand before him.**

**Verse:**

"Samantabhadra, born as Bhadramoorti, was the founder of the Jina religion. His words, like a thunderbolt, shattered the mountains of his opponents."

**The following two verses from the "Alankar-Chintamani" give us a glimpse of how opponents were humbled, dejected, and bewildered in the presence of Samantabhadra.**

**Verse:**

"Opponents, harsh in their words to their loved ones, before Samantabhadra, begged for mercy, saying, "Save us, save us!" (4-315) 

Page #112:
---------------------------
Samantbhadra, the great debater, is praised in this verse. The verse states that those who were not good debaters, the *kuvadins*, would speak harshly to their wives, but when they encountered Samantbhadra, they would become sweet-tongued and say, "Protect us, protect us," or "You are our protector." The second verse describes how the *kuvadins* would look down and scratch the ground with their thumbs when Samantbhadra entered a gathering. This shows the immense influence Samantbhadra had on his opponents, causing them to become dejected and confused.

What to speak of other scholars! Their existence holds no significance in the presence of Samantabhadra.

This verse provides some insight into the state of the opponents in the presence of Samantabhadra.

Many scholars have interpreted 'Dhurjati' in this verse as a synonym for 'Mahadeva' or 'Shiva' and therefore used the names Mahadeva and Shiva in their translations instead of 'Dhurjati'. However, this is not the case. Even if this name is a synonym for a particular individual here, it is not a synonym for the deity Rudra by the name Mahadeva or the deity Shiva. Mahadeva was neither a contemporary of Samantabhadra nor did Samantabhadra ever have any direct encounter or interaction with him. In such a situation, deriving the meaning of Mahadeva from 'Dhurjati' here is not just a mistake.

In reality, this verse was not composed solely to establish the importance of Samantabhadra, but it mentions a specific incident related to Samantabhadra's subject of debate. And from this, two historical facts are revealed:

Firstly, there was a very great scholar named 'Dhurjati' during the time of Samantabhadra, who was renowned for his cleverness, clarity, speed, and eloquence. This description further indicates that he was a specific individual of that time.

Secondly, Samantabhadra had a debate with him, in which he was quickly rendered speechless and could not speak further.

The meaning of this verse becomes even clearer from its ancient form, which was inscribed in the year 1050 Saka, by Mallisen...

Swami Samantabhadra. This verse is found in the 54th (67th) inscription named Prasasti and its form is as follows:
"Avtuntatamatati jhatiti sphutpatuvachaatadhoorjatirepijiha.
Vaadini Samantabhadre sthitavati tava sadasi bhoop kaasthaanyeshaam."
In this verse, the word 'api' is redundant after 'dhoorjati' and in the fourth line, the words 'tava sadasi bhoop kaasthaanyeshaam' are given instead of 'sati ka kathanyeshaam'. Also, its meter is different. The first verse is in the 'Aarya' meter and this one is in the 'Aaryageeti' meter, which has twenty matras in each line. Therefore, the difference in words from the first verse suggests that this verse was spoken by Samantabhadra or by one of his disciples in his presence, in a royal court, addressing the king. This royal court may be the same one where 'Dhoorjati' was defeated or it may be a different one. In the first case, this verse was spoken after Dhoorjati was silenced, targeting the other scholars present in the court, and asking the king what the faith of the other scholars in his court is now that a scholar like Dhoorjati has been reduced to this state. Does anyone among them have the courage to debate? In the second case, this verse seems to be a statement made at the time of Samantabhadra's commencement of the debate, and by mentioning the clear and serious defeat of Dhoorjati, it warns the other scholars that
1. This verse is also given in the same way in the inscription no. 90 of Davanagere Taluk, which is written in the 53rd year of Chalukya Vikrama, Keelak Samvatsara (AD 1128). See Epigraphia Karnatica, Volume 11th.

They engaged in debate with great thought and understanding. This is included in the descriptions of the beginning and ceremony of Samantabhadra's debate in the inscription*. However, regardless of the royal court where this verse was spoken, there is no doubt that the event it describes is of great significance. It seems that Dhūrjati was a very famous and renowned debater at that time, he had a great reputation among the people, and he was badly defeated in front of Samantabhadra. By defeating such a great debater with ease, Samantabhadra's reputation was further enhanced among other scholars, and since then it has become a proverb: "If even a scholar like Dhūrjati cannot stand his ground in debate against Samantabhadra, then what is the ability of other scholars to debate with him?"

The extent of Samantabhadra's debating prowess and the great influence he had on other scholars is evident from the above passages. However, we would like to point out here that Samantabhadra's field of debate was not limited. He did not only make his victory known in the land where he was born, but his love for debate, his desire to remove the ignorance of people and lead them towards the right path, and his Jain Siddha...

* As is evident from the following sentence given before those descriptions:
"Yasyaivaṃvidhā vidyāvādarambhasanrambhavijṛmbhitaabhivyaktayaḥ sūktayaḥ."

† In Aufrecht's 'Catalogue', Dhūrjati is described as a 'Poet', and poets are considered to be good scholars, as can be seen from the characteristics given in the previous footnote.

Samantbhadra Swami.
- The desire to imprint the importance of -ntas on the hearts of scholars was so great that he had made all of India the stage for his debates. He never waited for someone else to invite him to a debate, nor did his mental disposition allow him to be satisfied with letting those who were falling into the abyss of falsehood (khaddas) due to ignorance, continue doing so. And therefore, wherever he heard of a great debater or a large debating hall, he would go there and, by striking his debate drum, challenge the scholars to debate. Hearing the drum, the debaters, as per custom, would gather at the debate venue with the public, and then Samantbhadra would eloquently discuss his principles before them, and also declare that anyone who had any objections to any of those principles should come forward for a debate. It is said that people were mesmerized by the eloquent speech of Samantbhadra's Syadvada • Nyaya, weighed in the balance of truth, and were unable to oppose it in any way— if ever
* In those days, during the time of Samantbhadra - according to Fa-Hien (400 CE) and Xuanzang (630 CE), it was customary to keep a drum (a bheri or a nkkara) in a public place in the city, and any scholar who wanted to propagate a doctrine or, in a debate, wanted to prove his scholarship and skill, would strike the drum as a declaration of debate.

## Introduction of Qualities

If any man, due to ego or foolishness, raised any opposition, he would soon be silenced. In this way, Samantabhadra, like an undefeated lion, roamed fearlessly across the east, west, south, and north of India, engaging in debates. Once, while wandering, he reached the city of 'Karhaṭaka', which some scholars have identified as the modern 'Kanhad or Karaḍ' in the Satara district, and others as the city of 'Kolhapur' in South Maharashtra. This city was filled with many 'Bhaṭas' (brave warriors), was a prominent center of learning, and was either sparsely populated or densely populated. At that time, while expressing his intention to debate with the king there, he presented his introduction, in a verse, which is preserved in the aforementioned 54th inscription at Śravaṇa Belgola, as follows:

**"I have been to Pāṭaliputra in the east, and to the Malava-Sindhu-Thakkavishaya in the west, to Kāñcīpura in the south, and to the Vaidiśa in the north. I have reached Karhaṭaka, a city filled with many Bhaṭas, a prominent center of learning, and a place of great challenge. I am wandering, seeking debate, O King, like a lion playing."** _1_

_See, Mr. Edward P. Rice B.A.'s "History of Kannada Literature", p. 23._

_See, Mr. B. Lewis Rice's "Inscriptions at Śravaṇa Belgola", p. 42; however, in the second revised edition of this book, prepared by R. Narasimhachar, a corrigendum has been issued to replace 'Kolhapur' with 'Kanhad'._

_This verse is also found in Brahma Nemidatta's 'Ārādhanākathākoṣa'. However, this text was composed several hundred years after the inscription._

Swami Samantabhadra.
This verse reveals that before reaching Karhataka, Samantabhadra had traveled to and debated in various countries and cities, including Pataliputra (Patna), Malava (Malwa), Sindh, and the country of Thakk (Punjab), Kanchipuram (Kanjeevaram), and Vaidesha (Bhilsa). These were the main countries and regions where he had sounded the trumpet of debate, and where no one had opposed him.
1. Cunningham Sahib, in his book Ancient Geography, equates the country of 'Thakk' with the country of Punjab (S. I. J. 30). Mr. Lewis Rice Sahib also writes it as Punjab in his book on the inscriptions of Shravanabelagola. And Mr. Edward P. Rice Sahib, the author of 'History of Kannada Literature', has identified it as a country in Punjab by writing it as 'In the Punjab'. However, many Jain scholars have corrected the reading of 'Thakk' to 'Dhak' and identified it as 'Dhaka' in the Bengal region, which is incorrect. In Punjab, 'Attock' is a region. It is possible that the entire Punjab was called 'Thakk' in ancient times, or that the name 'Thakk' refers to that particular region near Sindh. The verse also places 'Thakk' in the same compound word after 'Sindh', which suggests that it is the country of Punjab or its Attock region, not Bengal or Dhaka. In that region of Punjab, there are many other names of this kind, such as 'Thattha'. Rao Bahadur R. Narasimhachar M.A., a scholar of ancient history, has also written 'Thakk' as the country of Punjab.
2. The region of Vidisha is called Vaidesha, which was the capital of the Dasharna country and is now called Bhilsa. Rice Sahib had interpreted 'Kanchipure Vaideshe' as 'to the out of the way Kanchi', which was incorrect and has been corrected in the revised edition of the Shravanabelagola inscriptions. Similarly, Mr. Aiyangar's interpretation of it as 'in the far off city of Kanchi' is also incorrect.

This was done. Also, it is known that the first main city in the middle of which you sounded the trumpet of the debate was the city called 'Pataliputra', which is now called 'Patna' and which was the capital of Emperor Chandragupta (Maurya).  The Kannada historical book called 'Rajavalikathe' also gives this self-introduction of Samantabhadra - the only difference is that it mentions the country called 'Karnat' before Karhatak, as Mr. Lewis Rice states in the preface of his book 'Inscriptions at Shravanabelgola'. But this does not reveal whether all this introduction in Rajavalikathe is only in Kannada or whether the mentioned Sanskrit verse is also mentioned as evidence. If that introduction is only in Kannada, then it is a different matter, and if the Sanskrit verse is also attached to it, which is very likely, then the inclusion of 'Karnat' before Karhatak cannot be done; doing so would break the meter and the mistake would be clearly evident. Yes, it is possible that the third line of the verse is given in it as 'Karnate Karhatake Bahubhate Vidyotkate Sankate'. If this is the case, then this

1 After our speculation, Babu Chhotelalji Jain, M.R.A.S. Calcutta, sent us an incomplete note based on the introduction written by Lewis Rice in 'Karnatak Shabdanusasan'. It gives one and a half verses of Samantabhadra's introduction, and calls it 'Rajavalikathe', of which one verse is 'Kanchyan Namatkoham' and the rest of the half verse is as follows:
Karnate Karhatake Bahubhate Vidyotkate Sankate Vadarth Vijahar Sampradidinam Shardulvikriditam.

It can be said that it is another form of the aforementioned verse which may have been spoken in another royal court after Karhataka. But, which was that other royal court or where else did Samantabhadra sound his trumpet after Karhataka, there are no means to know these things at this time. However, it is definitely known from the royal chronicles etc. that Samantabhadra stayed for some time in Kaushambi, Manuvakahalli, Lambush (2), Pundod, Deshapur and Varanasi (Banaras). But, whether he stayed there before reaching Karhataka or after, it could not be ascertained properly.
In Banaras, addressing the king there, you had also said this sentence: "Rajan Yasyasti Shakti: Sa Vadatu Purato Jainnirgranthavadi." That is - O King, I am a Jainnirgranthavadi, whoever has the power to debate with me, let him come forward and debate. And from this, your clear declaration of debate is found there as well. But, your declaration of debate in Banaras did not just remain a declaration, but it seems that a debate also took place, the mention of which is found in Tirumakudalu
1 A city situated on the banks of the Yamuna near Allahabad; Buddhism was widely preached here at one time. It was the capital of Vatsadesh.
2 Pund Nagar in North Bengal.
3 Some scholars have written 'Dashapur' as modern 'Mandasor' (Malwa) and some as 'Dholpur'; but in the Pampramayan (7-35) it is described as a city near 'Ujjayini' and therefore it seems to be 'Mandasor'.
4 This is the fourth line of the 'Kanchya Nanatkohe' verse.

### 3.3

The following verse, found in the inscription number 105 of Narsipur taluka, which was written in the Saka year 1105, states:

"Who would not praise Samantabhadra, the Muniśvara, who defeated his enemies, the Mithyākāntavādins, in front of the king of Varanasi?"

This verse states that Samantabhadra, the Muniśvara, who defeated his enemies, the Mithyākāntavādins, in front of the king of Varanasi, is worthy of praise by all.

It is not clear from any source whether Samantabhadra travelled to all these countries and cities in a single journey or if he had to make multiple journeys. However, based on experience and some events in his life, it is clear that he had to travel more than once to achieve his goals. Reaching Kāñcī from Thakk and then returning to Vaidiśa and Karahaṭaka also indicates this. He reached Varanasi from Kāñcī, passing through Daśapura.

There is also a mention about Samantabhadra being a 'Padarḍhika' - possessing the Charana ṛddhi - meaning he had the ability to walk through the air due to the power of his austerities.

1.  Bhatṭakalankadeva, in his 'Tattvārtha-Rājavārtika', describes the nature of those who possess the Charana ṛddhi as follows: "The ṛddhi related to action is of two types: Charanatva and Ākāśagāmitva. Of these, Charanas are of many types: those who travel by means of water, limbs, threads, flowers, leaves, rows, fire, and flames, etc. Those who travel through water are called Jalachāranas, who, taking water, can swim in ponds and other water bodies without any hindrance, like a fish, and are skilled in lifting their feet and depositing them. Those who travel through the air are called Jaṅghāchāranas, who, with their legs raised four angulas above the ground, are skilled in quickly lifting and depositing their legs, and are inclined to travel hundreds of yojanas. Others should be understood in the same way." - Chapter 3, Sutra 36.

-Rajavali Kathe. .. . In such a situation, it was not difficult for Samantabhadra to undertake long journeys to distant lands. It seems that he was able to travel easily to almost all parts of India. .. Regarding this travel of Samantabhadra, Mr. M.S. Ramaswami
Ayyangar, in his book 'Studies in South Indian Jainism', writes
"...It is evident that he (Samantabhadra) was a great Jain missionary who tried to spread far and wide Jain doctrines and morals and that he met with no opposition from other sects wherever he went.”
That is to say—it is clear that Samantabhadra was a very great Jain preacher, who tried to spread Jain doctrines and Jain morals far and wide, and that wherever he went, he did not face any opposition from other sects.

They did not face any opposition from other communities.
The author of 'History of Kannada Literature' - the writer of the history of Kannada literature - Mr. Edward P. Rice writes about Samantabhadra as a brilliant and influential orator and reveals that he was a great preacher of Jainism throughout India. He also states that he took full advantage of the custom of debating, mentioned in a footnote earlier, and was able to powerfully uphold the Jain doctrine of Syâdvâda.
So far, this entire statement has revealed much about Swami Samantabhadra's extraordinary qualities, his influence, and his travels for religious propagation, but it has not yet been revealed what kind of magic spell Samantabhadra possessed that enabled him to...

We have always been fortunate that learned people secretly listened to his pronouncements and his philosophical speeches.
And they rarely found themselves able to oppose him. - The very name of debate is such that it inevitably ignites the fire of opposition; people stand up to support it, even if they feel their position is weak, to protect their ego, and they do not even accept the other's reasonable point; yet, with Samantabhadra, this rarely happened, why? - There must be some special secret that needs to be revealed and which the reader will also be eager to know.
As far as we have investigated this matter - considered it deeply and experienced it from Samantabhadra's literature etc. - we have no hesitation in saying that the whole secret of Samantabhadra's success lies in the purity of his heart, the purity of his character and the importance of his speech; or, to put it another way, it is the greatness of his words, spoken for the sake of purity of heart and character, that has enabled him to make such an impact on others. Whatever Samantabhadra's speech was, it was almost always for the sake of the well-being of others. It was free from any worldly self-interest or any desire to bolster his ego and belittle others.

Their compassion was so profound that even the slightest trace of ill-will did not remain. They themselves were firmly established on the path of righteousness and desired that others too recognize and embark on this path. At the same time, they felt immense sorrow and distress upon witnessing others trapped in the wrong path. Therefore, their speech was always in accordance with their wishes, and through it, they strived to liberate such individuals to the best of their ability. It seemed that after achieving their own self-welfare, the welfare of others was their primary endeavor, which they carried out with great competence. Their speech was always devoid of anger; they never uttered harsh words, nor was their peace disturbed by the harsh words of others. Their eyes never showed any anger; they always remained cheerful and smiling. They were incapable of making sarcastic remarks about others' personalities out of ill-will, and sweet speech was inherent in their nature. This was the reason why even those who spoke harshly became gentle in their presence, and even the intoxicated by arrogance could not utter a word before them. Their

* As an example, these three verses reveal their compassion:

"Knowing that the intoxicated and the beastly are the same, and that creation is not possible without the difference in power, why are you afraid of them? They are soft and easily subdued." (35)

"Seeing that the ordinary and the extraordinary are born from the same source, why do they not recognize the extraordinary nature of these beings? How can they fall into such a state, when their nature is inherently inclined towards the welfare of others?" (36)

"Because of the free will of the world and its inherent nature, they are free from blame even when they wander on the path of unrighteousness. Those who are outside your vision are deluded, thinking that they have attained liberation through initiation and purification." (37)

And the words spoken by him, using the metaphor of 'vajraankush', were not found unpleasant by the people.
One special characteristic of Samantabhadra's words was that they were weighed in the balance of Syadvad Nyaya, and therefore, the ghost of bias never got to ride on them. Samantabhadra himself was a proponent of examination, he did not like clinging to any belief at all, he even examined Bhagwan Mahavir and only then accepted him as 'apt'. He also advised others to be proponents of examination - his constant teaching was that one should not accept any principle or theory without examination, just because others say so, but rather one should examine it thoroughly with strong arguments. One should find out its merits and demerits and then accept or reject it. In such a situation, he never tried to force any of his principles down the throats of others or to put them on their heads. He gave scholars the full opportunity to openly consider self-other principles with an impartial view. His constant declaration was that one should not look at any object from only one side - from only one side, but one should look at it from all sides and from all perspectives, only then can one have true knowledge of it. Every object has many dharma or limbs - this is why the object is anekantaatmak - to present the object entirely in the form of one of its dharma or limbs is ekant; and this ekantvad is mithya, kadagraha, opposed to tattvajnan, adharma and anyaya. Syadvadnyaya is the negation of this ekantvad. 

Page #127:
---------------------------
##  The Introduction of Qualities

The subject of Syadvada is the principle of Anekanta, which is opposed to all absolute categories like existence, non-existence, one, many, eternal, non-eternal, etc. It is based on the seven-fold predication (Saptabhanga) and the seven types of Nayas (Naya-Vivaksha). It is the differentiator of the object of renunciation (Heyadeya). The word "Syat" in sentences is the indicator of Anekanta and the qualifier of the object of knowledge. It is also indicated by words like "Kathanchit" etc.

For example:

> "In sentences, the Syat-nipat is the qualifier of the object of knowledge, because of its meaning and suitability, even for the absolute." (103)

> "Syadvada is the complete rejection of all absolutes. What is the purpose of the knowledge of the world? It is based on the seven-fold predication and is the differentiator of the object of renunciation." (104)

- Devagam

According to its declaration, Samantabhadra, in front of the learned, would test the merits and demerits of every subject using the yardstick of Syadvada. He would explain to them that in the same reality, by accepting certain absolute aspects,

1. "Syadvada is the subject of Anekanta, which is opposed to all absolute categories like existence, non-existence, one, many, eternal, non-eternal, etc." - Devagam

2. "Syat-asti, Syat-nasti, Syat-astinasti, Syat-avaktvy, Syat-astyavaktvy, Syat-nastyavaktvy, and Syat-astinastiavaktvy, these are the seven-fold predications, whose specific nature and mystery are given in the Devagam text called "Apt-Mimamsa" by Lord Samantabhadra."

3. "There are seven Nayas: Naigama, Sangraha, Vyavahara, Rijusutra, Shabda, Samabhirudha, and Evambhuta, which are divided into Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic. The first three are called Dravyarthic and the rest are called Paryayarthic. Similarly, the first four are called Arthanaya and the remaining three are called Shabdnaya. Dravyarthic are also called pure, certain, and real, while Paryayarthic are called impure, practical, and unreal."

One should learn the detailed nature of these Nayas from texts like "Naya-Chakra" and "Shloka-Varttika".

What are the inevitable faults that arise and how are those faults removed by accepting Syadvada-nyaya or by the influence of Anekantavada, and how is the harmony of the true nature established? * They had no sense of contempt for others in explaining them; they pointed out the way to those who were lost, like showing the way, with love, and made them aware of their mistakes, and this had a good effect on others from their speech, etc. - they had no reason to oppose it. This was the reason and this was the whole charm, which made Samantabhadra rarely face any particular opposition from other sects and he achieved good success in his purpose. - Here we consider it appropriate to reveal that Samantabhadra was the unparalleled master of Syadvada-vidya; he taught others Syadvada

In the Advaita-Ekant-paksa, the difference seen contradicts. The actions of the agents and the actions do not arise from one's own. || 24 || There would be no duality of karma, duality of fruit, duality of world. || 25 || If there is proof of the non-duality of the cause, then there would be non-duality of the cause and the effect. If there is no proof without the cause, then what is the duality of speech and thought? || 26 || Non-duality is not without duality, like a cause without a cause. The negation of the knower is never negated by the negated. || 27 ||

## Introduction to the Qualities

They did not merely preach about walking the path, but they themselves had completely colored their lives with the hues of Syadvada and were true and complete followers of that path. Every word or action of theirs resonated with Anekanta, and the kingdom of Anekanta reigned around them. The vast expanse or canopy of Syadvada that they had woven provided shade under which all could extinguish the heat of their ignorance and rest comfortably. Indeed, Samantabhadra greatly developed the knowledge of Syadvada. The detailed and systematic form he gave to Syadvada logic is not found in any text before him. In this regard, your text titled 'Aptanimamsa', also known as the 'Devagam' stotra, is a special and unique text. There is no other comparable text available in Jain literature. It seems that before Samantabhadra, the Syadvada knowledge of Jainism had largely disappeared, the people were mostly unaware of it, and it had no impact on them. Samantabhadra, with his extraordinary brilliance, revived that knowledge and spread its influence everywhere. This is why learned people like Bhattakalankadeva have described Samantabhadra as a follower of the Syadvada path. They have also given him the epithet 'Bhavyaikalochanayan' (unique eye for the blessed beings), which is also a characteristic of the Syadvada path.

**Salutation to the pair of lotus feet of Shri Vardhaman Mahakala, worthy of worship, and bowing down to them, I praise Samantabhadra, the protector of the blessed beings, the unique eye, and the follower of the Syadvada path.**

- Ashta Shati.

Shri Vidyānanda Ācārya, at the end of his commentary on Yuktyanusasan, has also described you as a follower of the Syadvada path with the epithet 'Syadvadamargānugaih'.

Swami Samantabhadra. We have always remembered Swami Samantabhadra with epithets like 'Syadvadavidyamaguru', 'Syadvadavidyadhipati', 'Syadvadasharir' and 'Syadvadamargaagrani'. But let this be, the great Acharya, Bhattakalankadeva, a logician of the 8th century, writes that 'Acharya Samantabhadra has made the Syadvadarupi Punyodadhi-tirtha, which is the subject of all the principles of reality, effective in this Kaliyuga, to remove the internal impurities of the Bhavyas - that is, its influence has been spread everywhere.

## Introduction to the Qualities

The words "in the Kali Yuga" (in the dark Kali Yuga) in this introduction are particularly noteworthy and convey two meanings. One is that it was a very difficult task to influence the Jain Tirthankaras in the Kali Yuga. Samantabhadra accomplished this, undoubtedly performing a difficult task that others could not or did not. The second meaning is that before Samantabhadra, the influence or glory of the aforementioned Tirthankaras either did not exist, or had become nearly extinct, or had never been as significant as it became during his time. There is hardly any dispute about the first meaning - in the Kali Yuga, when the impurities of the mind increase, it becomes difficult for good deeds to prevail. Samantabhadra himself, while stating that the Mahavira's multi-faceted teachings have the power to be the master of the "Ekaadhipaty" (absolute sovereignty), considered the Kali Yuga as an exception to that power - a reason for not being able to achieve "Ekaadhipaty". Although the Kali Yuga is a simple external reason, he considered the listeners' impure intentions (minds afflicted by philosophical delusion) and the speaker's (Acharya's) "Vachananaya" (unrefined, absolute Nayas) as the extraordinary reasons.

"Ekaadhipaty" is the absolute sovereignty of one who is necessarily relied upon by all.

The external reason for the exception is the Kali Yuga, which is a simple time period.

Nayas that are independent of each other are false, and those that are dependent on each other are called "Samyak" or "Vastutattva" (truth). This is why Swami Samantabhadra said, "Nirapeksha Nayas are false, Sapeksha are the true meaning of things" - Devagama.

Swami Samantabhadra.
(Along with practice) has been accepted, yet it is clear that in the Kaliyuga there is something that will hinder the work of that teaching - something that will make its - success difficult and complex - for sure. Such as
-
Kali: Kalirva Kalushaashayowa Shrotuh Pravakturvachanaanyowa. • Swachchasanaikadhipatitwalakshmi Prabhutvashakterapavadhetuh || 5 ||
— Yuktay anusasan.
  -
-
Swami Samantabhadra was a great speaker, he was completely free from the faults of Vachananyake, his words - as has been stated before - were weighed in the balance of Syadvadanyaya; even when the causes of defilement were present, his mind never became defiled - he did not experience agitation or anger - and therefore his words never violated the path. He had conquered the defiled intentions of his listeners with the power of his spiritual purity, his strength of character, and the influence of his praiseworthy words - he had changed it in many ways. This is why you were able to achieve so much success in establishing the Syadvadashasan, and the Kaliyuga could not pose any significant obstacle to it. Vasunandi Saiddhanthika, in praising and eulogizing your doctrine, has even written that the doctrine had destroyed the Kaliyuga's faults - that is, during the time of Samantabhadra Muni's teaching, it was not known that the Kaliyuga was passing today. Such as -
Lakshmi Bhrutparam Niruktinirata Nirvan Soukhyapradam Kujnanatapavaranaaya Vidhrut Chhatram Yatha Bhasuram.

**Praise to Samantabhadra**

I bow down to the supreme Samantabhadra, adorned with the jewels of right knowledge, right principles, and right reasoning, who has dispelled the darkness of the Kali Yuga and is pure. ||2||

-Devaagama Vritti. In this verse, the description of Samantabhadra's "mat" (doctrine) as Lakshmi-bhrut (possessing wealth), supreme, bestowing the bliss of liberation, dispelling the evils of the Kali Yuga, and pure, is very touching. It suggests that Samantabhadra's reign was adorned with the pearls of right knowledge, right principles, and right reasoning, and that it would dispel the ignorance of those who embraced it. This clearly indicates that Samantabhadra's Syadvada doctrine was very influential. The brilliance of the Kali Yuga must have dimmed in the face of his brilliance, and therefore, influencing the Jain Tirtha in the Kali Yuga was a special task of Samantabhadra.

In another sense, it seems better to simply accept that before Samantabhadra, the glory of the Syadvada Tirtha had almost disappeared. Samantabhadra revived it and infused it with extraordinary strength and power. The inscription on the lower rock at Shravanabelagola also suggests the same, indicating that the Jain path (Syadvada path), which is beneficial to all, has become prosperous in all directions in this Kali Yuga due to the efforts of Acharya Samantabhadra, the leader of the monastic order:

"Acharyasya Samantabhadraganabhrudyenekale kalau Jainam vartma Samantabhadram abhavadbhadram samantamuhuh" ||

-54th inscription.

Samantbhadra Swami.

Apart from this, in Kannada inscription no. 149 of Channarayapatna taluk, which is dated Saka Samvat 1047, there is a mention about Samantbhadra that he was 'a propagator of the Shrutakevali lineage and a repository of all knowledge'. As follows:

46
-
Shrutakevaligalulu Palavarum Atithara Aad Imbalike Tatsantano - .
Natiyam Samantbhadra
Vratipara Chalendaru Samastavidyaniidhigal ||

And also in inscription no. 17 of Belur taluk, which is engraved on a stone on the ceiling of the Soumya Nayaki temple inside the premises of the Ramanujacharya temple, and which gives the date of its inscription as Saka Samvat 1059, it is mentioned that after the Shrutakevalis and some other Acharyas, Samantbhadra Swami, following the path of the Tirthankara Shree Vardhamana Swami, achieved a thousandfold increase in the Jain path. As follows:

Shree Vardhamana Swamigal Tirthadolu Kevaligal Riddhiprapt Rung Shrutakevaligalam Param Siddhasadhyar Age Tait.......tyamam Sahasragunam Madi Samantbhadra- Swamigal Sandar... |

From both these mentions, it is found that Swami Samantbhadra, in this Kaliyuga, brought about an extraordinary advancement of the Jain path - the Syadvada Shastra.

1, 2 See 'Epigraphia Karnatica' Volume Fifth (E.C., V.) 3 The English translation of this part by Lewis Rice is as follows: Increasing that doctrine a thousand fold Samantabhadra swami arose.

...are the doers. In the 35th inscription of the Nagar Taluk, after mentioning the entry of the Kaliyuga after Bhadrabahu, you have been described as 'Kalikālagandhara' and 'Śāstra' (the scripture). Thus, Samantabhadra, who influenced the Syādvādaśāsana in the Kaliyuga, has been compared to 'Puṇyodadhi' (ocean of merit) by Bhatṭakalankadeva in his aforementioned verse. He has also called it 'Tīrtha' (pilgrimage) and revealed that it is meant to remove the internal impurities of the noble beings and has been influenced for this very purpose. All of Bhatṭakalanka's writings are aimed at that Vachanatiṛtha of Samantabhadra, for which you were then responsible for writing the commentary, and whose influence enabled even sharp-minded logicians like 'Pātrakesarī' to embrace Jainism.

From all these statements of Bhatṭakalanka, the unparalleled greatness of Samantabhadra's words is revealed. They were endowed with maturity, generosity, and depth of meaning, as well as some other unique glory. This is why great Acharyas and scholars have openly sung the praises of your words. Some examples of this are given below, which will further help readers understand the greatness of Samantabhadra's words and experience many virtues. It will also be known that Saman...

Swami Samantabhadra. What has been said or inferred above regarding the nature of T(h)abhadra's pronouncements, their culmination, and the revival of Syadvada knowledge is mostly correct.
"Bound by the fatalistic view of eternalism or annihilationism, beings are destined for a heap of misery. The pronouncements of the Lord, who is the proponent of Syadvada logic, are capable of leading them to that supreme, immaculate, and auspicious abode, free from all blemishes.  His pronouncements, based on examination and insight, are true and vanquish all false doctrines." - Ashta Sahasri. In this verse, Sri Vidyānanda Ācārya, a towering logician of the 9th century CE, celebrates the pronouncements of Swami Samantabhadra, writing that his words are capable of rescuing beings trapped in the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism from a heap of misery and leading them to that supreme, immaculate, and auspicious abode, free from all blemishes. They are the proponents of Syadvada logic, true in meaning, and based on examination and insight. They vanquish all false doctrines.
1. The belief that everything is eternally unchanging and remains in one form like a fixed object is called "eternalism," while the belief that everything is momentary and perishes every moment is called "annihilationism." The Devagamas clearly explain the nature of these two extreme views and the misery they lead to.
2. This is a description of Swami Samantabhadra. In the following verse from the commentary on Yuktyanusasan, Sri Vidyānanda Ācārya also remembers you with the epithet "parikshekshana" (one who examines), thus indicating your emphasis on examination.
"The glorious virtues of the Lord Jina have been examined in their entirety by the Guru Swami Samantabhadra, who is a master of examination. This Yuktyanusasan, adorned by the wise Vidyānanda, who follow the path of Syadvada, has been declared by the lords of truth."

Their tendency has been, and they have completely disintegrated - scattered - all false doctrines.

The brilliance of the virtues arising from the worship of the wise, the wealth of good reputation, the rise of knowledge and joy, the constant destruction of all afflictions.  The words of Samantabhadra, like the sun, are victorious over the seven-fold method, illuminating the path, dispelling the darkness of the heart, which is the one-sided view of existence and non-existence.

- Ashta Sahasri.

In this verse, Vidyananda Acharya indicates that the words of Samantabhadra are endowed with the wealth of good reputation, born from the collection of brilliant virtues, which are worshipped by the great wise.  It is illuminated by the seven-fold method, which conquers the rays of the sun with its brilliance, carries pure light, and dispels the darkness of the heart, which is the one-sided view of existence and non-existence.  At the same time, he blesses his readers, saying that these words will be a constant cause for the rise of your knowledge (Kevalgyan) and joy (Anant Sukh), and by their grace, you will attain the destruction of all your afflictions.  Here, the word "Vidyanandodaya" also has another meaning, which indicates that the words of Samantabhadra were the cause of the rise of Vidyananda Acharya, and therefore, he has expressed his own feelings of gratitude for his rise.

Samantbhadra, the revered one.
Whose unyielding strength, the creator of the infallible mantra of Syatkara, is the embodiment of pure and unwavering wisdom, the source of auspicious signs. May the Jain community, blessed with unwavering fortitude, be guided by the words of Samantbhadra, the source of diverse achievements.
This speech, fueled by the unwavering commitment to Ekant, a powerful antidote to the poison of ego, continuously nourished by the nectar of Anekanta, flows forth, guided by the principles of Pramana, spreading its influence across all realms. May it lead all to the pure and unblemished teachings of the Muni.

In these eight thousand verses, great masters like Shri Vidyānanda, who authored numerous significant works like Aṣṭasahasrī, Āptaparīkṣā, Pramāṇaparīkṣā, Satyaśāsanaparīkṣā, Śloka Vārttika, Śrīpurapārśvanāthastotra, and Jinaikaguṇa Saṃstuti, have praised the words of the pure-minded Shri Samantbhadra Muni in various ways. They have described it as possessing unyielding strength, the creator of the infallible mantra of Syatkara, pure and unwavering wisdom, the source of auspicious signs, a powerful antidote to the poison of ego, continuously nourished by the nectar of Anekanta, and guided by the principles of Pramana. They have also stated that this speech grants diverse achievements and benefits all beings.

The statement "I praise this speech, the source of all auspicious achievements," further supports this, as Patrakeśarī is another name for Vidyānanda. The Devāgama Stotra of Samantbhadra transformed the life of Patrakeśarī, making him a highly influential scholar.

Swami Samantabhadra. They are very important. You write that 'Those who have dried up the rivers of all good conduct for the examiners, and whose words are beautiful because they are imbued with flawless policy (Syadvadanyaya) and are indicative of the group of truths, are the leaders of the ascetics, the pioneers of the Syadvad path, the great and the radiant (sun) Shri Samantabhadra Swami, who bestow knowledge and wealth of joy on beings free from the impurities of the mind.' This shows the great importance of Swami Samantabhadra and his words.

-Chandraprabhacharita. In this verse, the great poet Shri Virananda Acharya, comparing Samantabhadra's Bharati (speech) to the garland of pearls (hārayasṭi) which is woven with threads of virtues, adorned with pure round pearls and has become the ornament of the necks of excellent men, indicates that Samantabhadra's speech is imbued with many virtues, adorned with pure round pearls and has become the ornament of the necks of great Acharyas and scholars. At the same time, he also tells that obtaining that garland is not as difficult as obtaining Samantabhadra's Bharati - understanding it and making it your own. And from this, it clearly emerges that the benefit of Samantabhadra's words is obtained only through great fortune and hard work.

##  The Introduction of Qualities

Shreenarendrasenacharya, in his 'Siddhantasarasangraha', also expresses a similar sentiment. He refers to Samantabhadra's words as 'anagha' (sinless), indicating their rarity, similar to the attainment of human birth. As stated:

> "The words of the divine Samantabhadra are 'anagha',
> As rare as human birth for living beings." (11)

Shrijinaseenacharya, who completed the 'Harivamshapurana' in Saka Samvat 705, has placed Samantabhadra's words in what category and compared them to the words of which great person, is revealed by his following verse:

> "The teachings of Samantabhadra, who established the path to liberation,
> Resound like the words of a hero." (30)

This verse states that the words of Samantabhadra, who established the path to liberation and taught through logic, are as radiant as the words of a hero, meaning they are equivalent to the words of the last Tirthankara, Shree Mahavira Bhagwan, and are also equal to them in brilliance and other qualities. This statement by Jinaseenacharya refers to the two works of Samantabhadra, 'Jivasiddhi' and 'Yuktyanushasan', and from this, the importance of these works (preachings) becomes self-evident.

> "The truth established by the principles of logic is unhindered.
> One should study the praise of Samantabhadra, the 'Yuktyanushasan'."

The 'Devagama' still today displays the omniscient. Certainly, it is the Yogiendra (Samantabhadra), the renunciant (giver), who has given the treasure chest (Ratnakarandaka) of jewels, the cause of inexhaustible happiness, to the beggar in the form of the grand assembly.

"Samantabhadra, the ornament of India, may he be auspicious for all auspicious purposes. The Devagama has been made manifest by him through the Devagama." - Pandavapurana.

In this verse, Shri Shubhachandracharya writes, "May Shri Samantabhadra, who has made the Devagama, the Agama of the Jinadeva, manifest in this world through his discourse called 'Devagama', be the ornament of India and the holder of the sole auspicious purpose, and may he shine in the world, that is, be able to dispel the darkness of the hearts of people through his knowledge and qualities."

A hymn of praise for Samantabhadra, from Bharata, has recently been obtained from the south. This hymn was composed by the poet Nagaraja and seems to be largely unpublished until now. Here, we consider it appropriate to present it to our readers for the increase of their experience. That hymn is as follows:

1. We are grateful to Pandit Shantirajji for obtaining it, who has been the president of the 'Jain Siddhanta Bhavan, Ara' for some time.

2. It is known from the 'Karnataka Kavi Charita' that a poet named 'Nagaraja' passed away in the Saka Samvat 1253. It is very likely that this hymn was composed by him; he was also adorned with the title 'Ubhayakavita Vilas'. He completed his 'Punyasravachampu' in the said Saka Samvat.

##  Translation:

**Verse 6:**

I praise the beautiful and wise Samantabhadra Bharati, who is capable of rescuing beings from the ocean of suffering, which is filled with the accumulation of karmas.

**Verse 7:**

I praise Samantabhadra Bharati, who is the middle path, the ultimate truth, the source of all knowledge, the destroyer of ignorance, the embodiment of the void, the one who leads to the realization of truth, the one who shines with the brilliance of her words, the one who is the essence of logic and reasoning, and the one who leads to liberation.

**Verse 8:**

I praise Samantabhadra Bharati, who is the embodiment of the two-fold truth, the one who is worshipped by the Nagas, the one who is adorned with the brilliance of her words, the one who destroys sins, the one who is the source of all happiness, the one who is both auspicious and worthy of respect.

**Explanation:**

This "Samantabhadra Bharati Stotra" provides a glimpse into the teachings, speeches, and writings of Samantabhadra. It highlights that Samantabhadra Bharati is revered by the Acharyas, shines with a beautiful reputation, and is as bright and profound as the ocean of milk. Her ability to destroy sins, false beliefs, and wrong conduct is a jewel in her crown, and her eloquence is her garment. She is capable of rescuing beings from the ocean of suffering, bestows all happiness, and is a source of benefit for the world.

This stotra, like many other teachings of Samantabhadra, emphasizes her dedication to the welfare of others. It reinforces the idea that her words and actions were always aimed at helping others.

Explanation is given. However, if one wishes to gain a deeper understanding of this subject, one should refer to the works of Samantabhadra himself. By studying them thoughtfully, that understanding will come naturally. The purpose of Samantabhadra's works is to benefit the world by removing sins, eliminating wrong vision, wrong understanding, wrong policy, and wrong conduct. Samantabhadra has expressed this purpose in many of his works, two examples of which are given below:

**Itiyamaptmimamsa vihita hitamichchatan.**
**Samyagmithyopadesharthaviseshapratipattaye.** || 114 ||

This is a verse from the 'Aaptmimamsa' text. It reveals the purpose of writing the text, stating that this 'Aaptmimamsa' is intended for those who desire their own benefit, to provide them with knowledge of the specific meaning of right and wrong teachings. In some copies of the text, the reading 'hitamichchatan' is found instead of 'hitamichchatan'. If this reading is correct, it is an epithet of the author Samantabhadra, and it implies that this Aaptmimamsa was created by Samantabhadra, who desires the benefit of others. The rest of the purpose of creation remains the same. In both cases, it is clear that this text was written to benefit others, to give them a special understanding of what is to be avoided.

**Na raganah stotram bhavathi bhavapaaschchhidhi munau na chaanyeshu dveshad apagunakathaabhyaasakhalata.**
**Kimu nyaayaanyaayaprakrutagunadoshajnamanasam.**
**Hitanveshopayaastava gunakathaasangagaditah.**

---------------------------
## Introduction to Qualities

This is the first verse of the hymn called 'Yuktyanusasan', which follows the last verse. In this verse, the Acharya has presented a very important sentiment. Addressing Lord Shri Vardhaman (Mahavira), he expresses his feelings about this hymn, which can be understood as follows:

"O Bhagavan, this hymn is not composed out of attachment towards you. It cannot be, because we are seekers of truth, and you have severed the bonds of existence - you have detached yourself from the world. In such a situation, attachment towards your personality cannot be the reason for the creation of this hymn. 

This hymn is also not related to any hatred towards others. As we are solitary beings, we do not harbor any hatred towards anyone's personality. We even consider the study of vices to be harmful, and since we do not engage in such study, that 'harm' is not present in us. Therefore, hatred towards others cannot be the reason for the creation of this hymn.

Then what is the reason or purpose of this hymn? The purpose is to guide those who wish to discern right and wrong, and those who desire to understand the qualities and defects of natural substances. This hymn, along with your story of virtues, is presented as a means of seeking welfare. 

Furthermore, the breaking of the bonds of existence, which you have achieved, is also the goal for us - to break our own and others' worldly attachments."

**Note:** This translation incorporates the Jain terms "Bhagavan", "Yuktyanusasan", and "Acharya".

Swami Samantabhadra.
It is clear from this that the compilation of Samantabhadra's works—the embodiment of his words—was not done under the influence of any trivial attachment or aversion. It was done for the sake of the Acharya's generosity and foresight, and it contains both his faith and his knowledge of qualities. At the same time, it is also evident that the purpose of Samantabhadra's works is great, for the benefit of the world, and almost none of his specific statements seem to have been made without a good examination of their merits and demerits.  _ From all this, it appears that Samantabhadra was highly esteemed and revered in the world because of all these qualities, and he established his unique fame in various countries. Undoubtedly, he was a sage, an abode of excellent qualities, blameless, and his glory illuminated the three worlds, or the three divisions of India, the north, the south, and the middle—his fame spread everywhere; as found in the following verse by the poet Narasimha Bhatta:
Samantabhadram sadbodham stuve varagunalayam | Nirmalam yadyashaskantan babhuva bhuvanatrayam || 2 ||
-Jinashatakatika. Because of all these revered qualities, Samantabhadra was particularly adorned with the title 'Swami' in the world. People used to call him 'Swami', 'Swamiji', and even great Acharyas and scholars 

Page #149:
---------------------------
##  Introduction to the Qualities

He is often remembered with this epithet. Although many other Acharyas were called 'Swami', this epithet is not as common with them as it is with Samantabhadra. It has almost become a part of Samantabhadra's name. This is why many great Acharyas and scholars, in many places, have mentioned him only by the term 'Swami' without giving his name. * This makes it clear that the Acharya was very famous as 'Swami'.  Undoubtedly, this title is indicative of his great reputation and extraordinary importance. He was truly the Swami of scholars, the Swami of renunciants, the Swami of ascetics, the Swami of sages, the Swami of virtuous people, the Swami of good people, and the Swami of those who wished well for the world.

* See - the verse from the *Vadirajsuri Krit Parsvanath Charitra* called 'Swaminashcharitam' which has been quoted above; the commentaries of *Sagardharmamrut* and *Anugardharmamrut* by Pandit Ashadhar, which contain verses like 'Swamyukta Ashtamulgunapakshe, iti Swamimaten Darshaniko Bhavet, Swamimaten Swime (Atichara), Atraha Swami Yatha, Tatha cha Swamisuktaani'; the *Nyayadipika* which quotes two *Devagama* karikas with the phrase 'Taduuktam Swamibhireva'; and many verses and phrases from the *Ashta Sahasri* and other works by Shri Vidyānanda Āchārya, some of which, like 'Nityayekanta', have been quoted above.

Future Tirthankara.
Samantbhadra's concern for the welfare of the world was so great that he was constantly absorbed in its betterment, day and night. His mind, speech, and body were all dedicated to it. He considered the entire world as his family - his heart was filled with 'Vishwaprema' (universal love) - and like a caring family member, he was always vigilant in the salvation of the world. It seems that through this yogic evolution, with the correct understanding of reality, he accumulated that great, boundless, and supreme 'punya' (merit) which will make him a 'Tirthankara' in this very Bharatavarsha - he will take birth to guide the 'Dharmatirtha' (religious pilgrimage). The fact that he will be a 'future Tirthankara' is mentioned in many scriptures, some excerpts of which are given below:

Pandit Jinadas Parsvanathji Fadkule has quoted it in the manuscript version of the *Swayambhu Stotra* which he has published with a Sanskrit commentary and Marathi translation. Upon our inquiry, Panditji has informed us that this verse is found in the text called *Charcha Samadhan*. From the name of the text, it seems that this verse is also quoted there and appears to be from some other ancient text.*

Swami Samantabhadra.
Four, 4 Abhikṣṇajñānopyoga, 5 Samvega, 6 Śaktitstyāga, 7 Śaktitstap, 8 Sādhusamādhi, 9 Vaiyāvṛtyakaraṇa, 10 Arhadbhakti, 11 Ācāryabhakti, 12 Bahuśruta bhakti, 13 Pravacanabhakti, 14 Āvśyakāparihāṇi, 15 Mārgaprabhāvanā and 16 Pravacanavatsalatva, these sixteen qualities were mostly present - your soul was inspired by their high and deep feelings - because, for the sake of Darshanavishuddhi, these very qualities are mentioned in the Agam as the cause of the 'Nāmakarma' of the 'Tīrthankara Prakriti' named 'Mahāpuṇyaprakriti' * . The nature of these qualities is explained in detail in many commentaries of the Tattvārthasūtra and many other texts, so there is no need to explain them here. However, it must be mentioned that along with Darshanavishuddhi, Samantabhadra's 'Arhadbhakti' was very high, it had reached a very high level of development. It did not have any place for blind faith or superstition, quality knowledge, quality pleasure and simplicity of heart were its foundation, and therefore it was completely pure and flawless. By the power of this pure devotion, Samantabhadra seems to have become so powerful, brilliant and virtuous. He himself had experienced this, and that is why he writes at the end of his 'Jinastuti-Śataka'
* See, the 24th sūtra of the sixth chapter of the Tattvārthādhigama Sūtra, and the following verse of its 'Śloka Vārtika' commentary -

Viśuddhadayo nāmnastiṛthakṛtvasya hetavaḥ |
Samstā vyastarūpā vā dṛgviśuddhyā samanvitāḥ ||

Future Tirthankara!
My faith is in you, my memory is devoted to you, my hands are raised in salutation to you, my ears are eager to hear your stories, my eyes behold your form, my passion is to compose beautiful hymns in your praise, and my head bows in reverence to you.  Such is my service to you, my constant devotion to you. Therefore, O Lord of Radiance (Kevalgyan Swami), I am radiant, virtuous, and righteous. 

These heartfelt words of Samantabhadra paint a clear picture of his profound devotion to the Arhats and how he had dedicated himself completely to their service.  His deep reverence for the qualities of the Arhats is evident in his words. 

This mention of Samantabhadra suggests that the "Jinshataka" text was composed at a time when he had already created many beautiful hymns and stotras, and composing praise had become his passion. It is not surprising that stotras like "Devagam," "Yuktyanusasan," and "Swayambhu" were composed before this text.  It is because of these beautiful hymns that Samantabhadra was able to describe his passion for composing praise as "Sustutivyasan." 

Page #154:
---------------------------
## 66.
Swami Samantabhadra.
There is no doubt that due to his immense love, he was able to accumulate the merit necessary to become an Arhant, and even a Tirthankara among the Arhants. He had a great interest in composing beautiful and praiseworthy hymns that expounded the qualities of an Arhant. He made this his passion, and rightly so. Except for a few, all the texts attributed to Samantabhadra are in the form of hymns, revealing his unparalleled devotion to the Arhants. Apart from the 'Jinastuti Shataka', 'Devagam', 'Yuktyanusasan', and 'Swayambhu Stotra' are his prominent works of praise. The system of hymns used in these texts, filled with knowledge of the principles and giving due importance to even the most complex philosophical discussions, is rarely found or is very limited in texts prior to Samantabhadra. Through his hymns, Samantabhadra significantly elevated and refined the art of praise, which is why he was known as 'Stutikar' (Hymnist). He was also honored as the 'Aady Stutikar' (First Hymnist). Shri Hemchandra, the chief Acharya of the Shwetambar sect, also referred to him as 'Stutikar' in his 'Siddhhaimshabdhanushasan' grammar, in the commentary of the second sutra, using the phrase "Stutikaro'pyah". He also quoted the following verse from your 'Swayambhu Stotra':

"Nayastava syat padalanchhana ime rasopaviddha iva lohadhatavah. Bhavantyabhipretaphalayatato bhavantamarya pranata hiteshinah."

1-2 In the 'Swayambhu Stotra' published in the 'Sanatan Jain Granthamala', and in the Sanskrit commentary by Prabhachandracharya on the 'Swayambhu Stotra', the readings 'Satyalanchita' for 'Lanchhana ime' and 'Guna' for 'Phal' are found. 

Page #155:
---------------------------
Future Tirthankarahood. This same verse has also been quoted by the foremost Svetambara leader, Shri Malayagiri Suri, in his commentary on 'Aavashyak Sutra', with the introductory phrase 'Aandhastutikaaro'pyaah', and in this way, Samantabhadra is indicated as the 'Aadhstutikaara' - the first or the best praiser. From these mentions, it is also found that Samantabhadra was very famous as a 'Stutikaara' and therefore, perhaps, there was no need to mention his name along with 'Stutikaara'.

Why was Samantabhadra so fond of this composition of praise and why did he prefer this path? Although the simple reason may be his devotional fervor or special devotion, here, we consider it appropriate to clarify this matter further in his own words and also to reveal what Samantabhadra's feelings were about these hymns of praise and how he viewed them. You write in your 'Svayambhustotra':

Stuti: Stotu: Sadho: Kushala Parinaamaaya Sa Tada,
Bhavenma Va Stutyah Phalampita Tatastasya Cha Satah.
Kimevam Swaadheenyaaj Jagati Sulabhe Shrayasapathe.
Stuyaanattva Vidvaan Satatam Abhipujyam Namijinam. ||116||

1. On this, Muni Jinavijayaji writes in the first issue of his 'Saahityasamshodhaak' - "It is clear from this mention that these (Samantabhadra) were considered famous praisers, not only that, but they were also considered to be the first praisers." 

Page #156:
---------------------------
Swami Samantabhadra.
That is to say - whether the object of praise is present or not at the time and place of praise, and whether the fruit of praise is directly obtained through it or not, but the praise of the virtuous praiser is certainly the cause of a skillful result - a result of merit - and that skillful result or the special merit arising from it is the giver of the fruit of good fortune. When in the world, the path of liberation is easily accessible in this way - obtained through one's own praise - then, O always venerable Namin, who is the wise or discerning person who will not praise you? He will surely do so.
68
-
This makes it clear that Samantabhadra considered the path of liberation to be easily accessible and independent through these Arhat Stotras. He wrote them as 'Janmaranyshiki' - the fire that burns the forest of the world of birth and death - and they were the nourishment of his feeling of liberation - the attainment of liberation - in which he was always vigilant. This is why he made these Jina-stotras his addiction - he used them frequently in such auspicious deeds. This was the reason why there was no obstacle to his progress in the world - his glory - it was indestructible. The following verse from the 'Jinastuti Shataka' also echoes this:
6
'Vandibhūtavata'pinonnatihati'nantusch yeṣāṁ mudā
।'
1 - 'Janmaranyshiki stava:' is written in 'Jinastuti Shataka'. 2 Yeṣāṁ nantuh (stotuḥ) mudā (harṣeṇa) vandibhūtavata'pi (mangalapāṭhakī bhūtavata'pi nagnācāryarūpeṇa bhavatopi mama) nonnatihatiḥ (na unnateḥ māhātmysya hatiḥ hananam). iti taṭṭīkāyāṁ narasiṁhaḥ.
* This entire verse is as follows 

Page #157:
---------------------------
Future Tirthankarahood.

In this very text, a verse is found as follows:

"He who bears the burden of patience, does not speak clearly about the Lord.
Your words, from devotion, are like the touch of a touchstone, full of essence." (6)

Here, in a few words, the great merit of Arhat devotion is shown - it is explained that "O Lord, just as iron, by consuming (touching) the touchstone (parasa-pashana), becomes gold and gains brilliance, in the same way, this human being, by serving you, becomes a very clear (detailed) knower, bearing brilliance, and his speech also becomes essential and profound."

It seems that Samantabhadra, due to his devotion of this kind, always remained absorbed in Arhat devotion, and this was the result of his devotion, that he became so knowledgeable and brilliant, and his words were unique and possessed unparalleled greatness. - Samantabhadra's path of devotion becomes very clear from a deep study of his praise-texts. In fact, Samantabhadra was an embodiment of all three - Jnana Yoga, Karma Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga - he was not a partisan of any one of these Yogas alone - he did not have any one-sidedness.

"The praise of the fire of the forest of birth, the memory, even though it is overwhelmed by the ocean of afflictions, is the ultimate treasure for the devotees, a replica, the ultimate fulfillment of all desires. Those who are honored, even though they are not elevated, are not diminished, but are always joyful.
May the Lord of the Gods, the givers, the victors, be merciful to them." (115)

One-sidedness, which is taken for the impartial behavior of the doctrines, is called "niri" or "mithya" one-sidedness. Samantabhadra was free from this mithya-ekantata; in refuting an objection in the Devagama, he wrote, "There is no mithya-ekantata in us." 

Page #158:
---------------------------
## Swami Samantabhadra

1.  Samantabhadra was a staunch opponent of **ekantavada** (extreme monism) and did not consider it to be a true principle. One of the reasons he considered the **Arhat** (liberated being) worthy of praise and made them the subject of his **stuti** (hymn) was the **ekanta** view's refutation by them. The Arhat, through their **nyaya-vanas** (arguments of justice), refuted the **ekanta** view or proved its refutation and, by destroying the enemy **moha** (delusion), became the emperor of **kaivalya** (liberation). Therefore, Samantabhadra, addressing them, says that you are worthy of my praise - you are deserving. As in:

> 70.  **ekanta-drishti-pratisedha-siddhi-nyayeshubhi-moha-ripu-nirasya | asis-ma kaivalya-vibhutisamrat, tatas-tvam-arhasi me stavaha: 55**
>
> — **Swayambhu Stotra** |

I.  This clearly shows Samantabhadra's emphasis on examination and also reveals that his two main life goals were: 1) refuting **ekantavada** and 2) becoming the emperor of **kaivalya** by destroying the enemy **moha**. Samantabhadra was quite successful in achieving these goals. Although he did not become the emperor of **kaivalya** in this life, he had acquired almost all the necessary qualifications to do so. This is no small achievement, and therefore, he will become the emperor of that **vibhutis** (splendor) - the **tirthankara** (founder of a Jain order) - as mentioned above. Even without **kevalgyan** (omniscience), Samantabhadra was adorned with the unparalleled **vibhutis** of **syadvada** (theory of maybe) which is described as illuminating all truths like **kevalgyan** and in which, as well as in **kevalgyan**, the only difference is that of **saakshat** (direct) and **asaakshat** (indirect).

*  There is no doubt that your knowledge regarding the useful substances was very extensive, and this is evident from the many previous incarnations and the writings of Samantabhadra. This is why Shri Jinaseanacharya has written your words as luminous as the words of the Kevali Bhagwan Mahavira, and many other prominent Acharyas and scholars have openly praised your knowledge and speech.  _ This entire introduction makes it absolutely clear, and there is no doubt, that Samantabhadra was a very great Mahatma, a capable scholar, an influential Acharya, a great Muni Raja, the leader of Syadvada Vidya, the eradicator of the Ekant Paksha, a force without limits, a 'Satisey Yogi', a Satisey Vadi, a Satisey Vagmi, a great poet, an excellent speaker, an embodiment of virtues, calm, serious, a bearer of good purpose and good intentions, a speaker of truth, a well-wisher of the world, a lover of the world, dedicated to the welfare of others, revered by the Munis, praised by great Acharyas and scholars, and an unparalleled symbol, influencer, and propagator of the Jain religion.

The Muni Life and the Emergency.

In the foundationless and tranquil Muni life of Swami Samantabhadra, once a great wave of hardship came, which we call an "emergency." What was that hardship and how did Samantabhadra overcome it, is a very heart-wrenching subject. Below, some introduction and thoughts are presented before the readers, along with his Muni life. Samantabhadra, according to his Muni conduct, followed the five great vows of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession in the proper manner; he constantly strengthened himself by following the five samitis of walking, speech, eating, etc.; he was always eager in controlling the five senses, steadfast in following the three secrets of mind, speech, and body, and always careful in performing the six essential actions like Samayika, etc. Following the vow of complete non-violence, he did not want to cause any pain to any living being with his mind, speech, or body. He always took care that no creature was harmed by his carelessness, therefore he walked searching for the path during the day, did not let his vision wander while walking, did not travel at night, and was so resourceful that he would stay on one mat while sleeping - it did not happen that he would change from one mat to another in his sleep and harm any living being; he would pick up and put down any object like a fan, book, etc., with care, and would also dispose of excreta in a suitable place on the ground and in a secluded place without any obstacles.

He used to throw things. Besides this, if anyone attacked him, he would not resist, nor would he harbor ill will towards him; if wild animals in the forest tormented him or mosquitoes etc. sucked the blood of his body, he would not forcibly prevent them, nor would he stop the free movement of ants etc. on his body while in meditation. He endured all these and many other similar afflictions and trials with equanimity, and always maintained patience, contemplating his own karma-vipaka - he did not blame others in the least.

Samantabhadra was a great lover of truth; he always spoke truthfully, not only that, but he never uttered a word that would cause pain to others, even when prompted by a lapse in concentration; and many times he considered it best to remain silent. Although he did not disrespect women, he never looked at them with lust; rather, he recognized them as mothers, sisters, and daughters; moreover, he had complete aversion to sexual intercourse, with a repulsive view, and he considered it to be both material and emotional violence. Besides this, he considered non-violence towards living beings to be 'Param Brahma'.

And they considered that complete non-violence was achieved only through that ascetic practice where even a particle of beginning did not occur. For the sake of that complete non-violence and the attainment of that supreme Brahman, you renounced both internal and external possessions and entered the Naigranthya ashram, adopting your natural Digambar attire. Therefore, you did not keep any money with you, and even considered associating with money to be against your Muni-hood. You had no attachment to the few possessions you had in the form of cleansing tools (karmadal), tools of restraint (pichhi), and tools of knowledge (books, etc.), even if someone took them away, you were not concerned in the least. You always slept on the ground and never adorned or decorated your body; if sweat accumulated on it and made it dirty, you would wash it yourself with your own hands and never tried to show your bright form to others; rather, you tried to conquer that dirt-born assembly with equanimity and wash away the karmic fruits, and in this way, you remained naked and happily endured other hardships like cold, heat, etc.; in this way, you have revealed yourself as 'Nagnaatko' and 'Malmalinatanu' in one of your descriptions, with pride.

Samantbhadra ate only once a day, never at night, and even that meal was according to the prescribed method of the Agamas.

Therefore, for the sake of attainment, the supremely compassionate one, both the scriptures, you, who are like the wind, are not attached to a distorted body. || 119 ||

He only accepted pure, wholesome, and blameless food. He would not accept an invitation for such food, nor would he induce anyone to prepare food for him in any way. And if he knew that someone had prepared food for him or for another guest, he would not take it. He felt that taking it would make him a participant in the sin of *savadyakarma*, and he always wanted to keep himself free from *savadyakarma* through mind, speech, body, and action. He considered only that pure food to be appropriate and scripturally approved which the giver had prepared for himself or his family, which was already present at the place of giving before his arrival, and from which the giver, after offering a portion to him with devotion, wanted to be satisfied with the rest—he would not need to start preparing it again for his own meal. He would take food with the *bhramari* attitude, without causing any inconvenience to the giver. If, during the meal, he noticed any of the aforementioned faults or any obstacle arose, he would happily leave the food at that moment and would not let any stain come upon his mind due to this loss. Besides this, his food was limited and purposeful. The scriptures allow monks to eat up to 32 mouthfuls, but he often ate two, four, or ten mouthfuls less than that. And when he saw that he could manage without food—that there was no particular obstacle in following the daily routine and performing religious rituals—

They would also observe fasts, abstaining from food for many days; they would often fast, keep their stomachs empty, give up many flavors, and sometimes even take on difficult and secret rules that depended on their natural fulfillment for their food. In fact, Samantabhadra considered food to be merely a means of this journey of life. He considered it only an aid to the growth, attainment, and stability of his knowledge, meditation, and restraint, and he accepted it from this perspective. He did not desire to increase any physical strength, to make the body strong, or to increase vitality through it; he did not eat for taste either, which is why he would often swallow the morsels of food without chewing them - without savoring their taste. He understood that food taken only for the purpose of maintaining the body's existence does not need to be savored, it only needs to be placed in the stomach. At the same time, he believed that savoring flavors strengthens the sense objects, that consuming sense objects never brings true peace, but rather increases craving, that the increase of craving constantly produces heat, and that due to that heat or burning, this being suffers from many kinds of suffering in the world; * therefore, he never strengthened the sense objects for the sake of temporary pleasure - the temporary pleasures. * "Shatahudodnimesha chalana hi saukhyam, trishnamayapayanamatrahhetuh.

Swami Samantabhadra considered desire to be a stain and an act of unrighteousness for those who are seeking liberation. His special belief was that the ultimate health - the indestructible state of self-realization or the state of liberation from karma, infinite knowledge, etc. - is the true purpose of humans - of this soul - not the fleeting enjoyment of worldly pleasures - the temporary experience of sensual delights; because the thirst for enjoyment - the increasing desire for pleasures - never brings peace to physical and mental suffering. He believed that this body is 'ajangama' - devoid of conscious pulsating activity - and is driven by the conscious self in its own activity like a machine. It is also 'malavij' - born of impurities; 'malayoni' - the place of origin of impurities; 'galamal' - impurities flow from it; 'puti' - foul-smelling; 'bibhats' - repulsive; 'kshayin' - perishable; and 'tapak' - the cause of suffering for the soul; therefore, he did not consider it good to have affection for this body and to increase attachment, he considered it futile, and he accepted this kind of belief and consequence as self-benefit. His thoughts like this...

Due to the effects of his past karma, Samantabhadra was completely detached and indifferent to his body. He had no interest or attachment to worldly pleasures. He only consumed a small amount of pure food to sustain his body, solely for the purpose of fulfilling his spiritual goals. He paid no attention to whether the food was rough or smooth, cold or hot, light or heavy, bitter or astringent.

In return for this minimal sustenance, Samantabhadra worked tirelessly with his body. He would spend hours engaged in various activities, practicing austerities like exposure to heat and cold, and other rigorous external practices like fasting, all without hiding his strength, to further his spiritual growth.  Apart from this, he dedicated a significant portion of his time to religious practices like Samayika, Stutipath, Pratikramana, Swadhyay, Samadhi, Bhavana, Dharma Upadesh, writing scriptures, and promoting the welfare of others. He never wasted a moment without engaging in some form of spiritual practice.

In this way, with great love and devotion, Swami Samantabhadra was living his life as a Muni in the village of 'Manurvak Halli', immersed in meditation and experiencing joy. He was progressing on the path of self-realization through various arduous austerities. Suddenly, due to the intense manifestation of his past negative karma, a severe illness called 'Bhasmaka' afflicted his body. 
1. "Practice external austerities, which are extremely difficult, to strengthen your inner spiritual practice." - Swayambhu Stotra.

Swami Samantabhadra.
A great disease called 'Bhasmaka' arose. The origin of this disease clearly indicates that at that time, the phlegm in Samantabhadra's body had become depleted, while both wind and bile had increased; because when phlegm is depleted, and bile, along with wind, increases and becomes aggravated, it makes the gastric fire extremely intense, powerful, and sharp with its heat and intensity. This fire, with its sharpness, scorches the food in the body, rejecting it and reducing it to ashes in an instant. This extremely sharp state of the gastric fire is called 'Bhasmaka' disease. If this disease is neglected, that is, if one does not consume sufficient quantities of heavy, oily, cool, sweet, and phlegmatic food and drink, or until one is satisfied, it will also burn the blood, flesh, and other tissues of the body, causing great weakness, thirst, sweating, burning sensation, fainting, and many other complications. Finally, it leaves the patient on the verge of death. +

He didn't care much about it. Just as he used to endure hunger pangs during the voluntary fasts and other austerities he had undertaken, so too did he endure it on this occasion, relying on the strength of his previous practice - but there was a big difference between this hunger and that hunger; due to this increasing hunger, he began to experience unbearable pain after only a few days; earlier, hunger would arise at a fixed time, hours after eating, and if food was not taken due to being engaged in other matters, the hunger would die down and there would be no trace of it for hours; but now, not long after eating, hunger would strike again, and if food was not available, the digestive fire would begin to burn the blood and flesh around it. Samantabhadra suffered greatly from this; there is no other bodily pain equal to hunger; it is also said -
"In a man with depleted phlegm, the aggravated bile, accompanied by wind, gives strength to the fire in its own place of heat. Thus, in a body that is dry and full of wind, the fire, having obtained fuel, burns fiercely again and again. It continuously cooks the tissues, blood, etc., and then brings weakness, diseases, and even death. One gets peace by eating, but it is tormented by digestion. Thirst, burning sensation, fainting, and diseases are caused by excessive fire. "Therefore, one should pacify the blazing fire with cool, sweet, and heavy food and drink, just as one would extinguish a fire with water."
- Thus says Charaka.

Samantbhadra Swami |
'There is no bodily pain like hunger.'
. At this time of intense hunger, it was against their Muni Dharma to beg for food from anyone, to eat again, or to inspire someone to prepare good, oily, sweet, cool, heavy and phlegm-inducing foods for them for the sake of alleviating their illness. Therefore, Samantbhadra, considering the situation, contemplated many excellent thoughts at that time and addressing his soul, said, "O Atman, you have wandered in this world for countless ages, enduring unbearable hunger-pain in many hells, animal, etc. realms; this hunger of yours is nothing compared to that. You have experienced such intense hunger that even after consuming the food of the three worlds, it did not subside, but you did not get even a single grain to eat. You have endured all these hardships under the control of others, and therefore, you have not gained any benefit from them. Now, you are free, endure this pain. All this is the result of your past karma. By enduring the pain with equanimity, karma will be exhausted, new karma will not be bound, and you will never again have the opportunity to suffer such pain." In this way, Samantbhadra kept his equanimity firm and did not give rise to the opportunity for passions and other evil qualities to arise. Besides this, all they could do to get this body some more food and to prevent the physical strength from being particularly depleted was to loosen or postpone the external and severe austerities like fasting, etc., which they were performing and whose practice depended on their daily desire and strength - like the basic qualities, it was not mandatory. They

They did the same—they no longer observed fasting, anashan, unodara, vruttiparisankhyan, rasaparitvag and kayaklesh, the external tapas, they had suspended them all for a while. They were now taking 32 mouthfuls of food; besides this, they had also received almost all the concessions that could be given to a sick muni. But even with all this, your hunger did not find any peace, it was increasing day by day and becoming more and more intense, the flames of the stomach fire and the sharp heat of the bile were burning the body's rasa and blood, the flames were running far and wide over the limbs of the body, and the daily little food was not enough for them at all—it was like sprinkling a little water on a blazing fire. Besides, if there was any interruption in the food on any day, then it became even more difficult—the hunger demon became even more fierce and merciless on that day. The reader cannot even imagine the great pain that Samantabhadra was experiencing. In such a situation, even the best of the brave lose their patience, faith is corrupted and knowledge is shaken. But Samantabhadra was a great soul, a great soul, a knower of the transmigration of the soul, he was equanimous in prosperity and adversity, he was the holder of pure right faith and his knowledge was not afflicted by sorrow, which is weakened when sorrow comes.

It is said that he had practiced austerities with great intensity, bearing hardships as much as he could. He used to bear hardships with joy, not feeling any regret while enduring them. Therefore, at this time of crisis, he could not be disturbed or lose his composure in the least.
When Samantabhadra saw that the disease was not subsiding, the body's weakness was increasing, and due to that weakness, there was some obstruction in the daily necessary actions; also, some troubles like thirst had started, then you felt great anxiety. You started thinking - "In this state of a monk, where according to the rules laid down in the scriptures, forty-six defects like origin-production, fourteen impurities, and thirty-two obstacles are avoided, and food is taken which is both sufficient and limited, there can be no arrangement for suitable and sufficient food for the pacification of this terrible disease. While maintaining the position of a monk, this disease seems almost incurable or helpless; therefore, I should either abandon my monkhood
* *Aatmadehantargyanajanitaahaadnirvritah. Tapasadu:shkrutanghoram bhujanopi na vidyate.*
-Samadhitantra. Those who know the nature of these origins and obstacles from the scriptures and who have good knowledge of Pindashuddhi, do not need to be told how much difficulty true Jain ascetics have to face for food. The reason for these difficulties is not any lack of donors, but the complexity of the food method and pure food is often a reason. Then, for the pacification of a disease like 'Bhasmak', suitable and sufficient food is far from being a possibility.

And one should be ready to abandon this body for the sake of Dharma by taking the vow of 'Sallekhana'; but how can one abandon the Muni-pad! For the sake of Muni-dharma, I have already surrendered everything, which I have been nurturing with great love till now
and which is the only basis of my goal, can I abandon it? Can I abandon it out of fear of hunger or to avoid it? Can I sacrifice it for the sake of a little pleasure arising from sense objects? This cannot be. Will this body remain in the same state and be happy forever by resisting these pains of hunger etc. or by experiencing the little pleasure arising from sense objects? Will there be no rise of pain of hunger etc. in this body again? Will death not come? If nothing like this is there, then what is the virtue in resisting these pains of hunger etc.? What benefit can it be to this body or the embodied soul? * I will never abandon Muni-dharma to avoid pain; even if this body is destroyed, I do not care; my soul is immortal, no one can destroy it; I had taken Muni-dharma to welcome pain, not to be afraid of it and to avoid it; this is the time of my test, I will not
  * This feeling of yours regarding the resistance of pain of hunger etc. is also expressed in the following verse of 'Swayambhu Stotra'

86. . . "Swami Samantabhadra, I will leave." At that moment, another voice arose from within his heart, "Samantabhadra! You are capable of uplifting the Jain religion in many ways and spreading it. Through your efforts, the ignorance and falsehood of many beings will be destroyed, and they will embark on the path of righteousness. Is this work of religious upliftment and public welfare any less virtuous? If, for the sake of this religious upliftment and public welfare, you were to temporarily relinquish the monkhood and, by ensuring proper arrangements for your food, alleviate your illness and then resume the monkhood, what harm would there be? Your knowledge, faith, and character will not be harmed in the slightest; they will remain with you always. You may not be a monk in terms of physical form or external appearance, but in terms of your inner state, you will remain a monk. So, what is there to think or ponder about? Accept this as a temporary deviation from the path of righteousness. Your ultimate goal has always been the welfare of others. Why are you now making it secondary? If, for the sake of others, you were to sacrifice a little of your own self-interest, temporarily relinquish the monkhood, and benefit many, your character will not be tarnished in the slightest; on the contrary, it will shine even brighter. Therefore, for a few days, relinquish your attachment to the monkhood, and without caring for honor or disgrace, strive to alleviate your illness. It is not insurmountable. Once you are free from this illness, in a state of health, you will be able to observe the monkhood even more perfectly. There is no need to delay; delay will only cause harm."

Thus, for a long time, thoughts arose and fell within Samantabhadra's heart. Finally, he resolved that... 

Page #175:
---------------------------
Monk-life and Emergency.
"It is not right to break one's righteous rules out of fear of suffering like hunger, etc., and to seek their remedy; the welfare of the world is truly dependent on the world, and my welfare is dependent on me; it is true that I could not serve the world as much as I wanted to; but the feeling of that service is present in my soul and I will fulfill it in the next birth; at this time, it is not appropriate to spoil self-interest in the hope of the welfare of the world; therefore, I must now take the vow of 'Sallekhana' and, sitting in anticipation of death, peacefully renounce this body for the sake of Dharma." With this determination, Samantabhadra went to his venerable Gurudev, who was old, austere, and adorned with many virtues, to seek permission for the Sallekhana vow and told him the whole story of his illness. At the same time, he declared to him that his illness seemed incurable and that taking refuge in 'Sallekhana' in the state of incurable illness is said to be the best, * he humbly requested that 'now you kindly grant me permission to take Sallekhana and bless me that I may be able to perform it courageously and willingly.' Hearing this announcement and request of Samantabhadra, the Guru remained silent for a while, he cast a serious look at Samantabhadra's face and then from his
'Rajavala Katha' it is known that Samantabhadra's Gurudev was present at that time and Samantabhadra went to him to seek permission for Sallekhana, but it could not be known what his name was.

Swami Samantabhadra.
It was known through yogic powers that Samantabhadra was not of short lifespan, and that he was destined to perform great deeds for the upliftment of Dharma and the reign. In this light, he was not eligible for Sallekhana; if he were allowed Sallekhana, he would prematurely fall into the jaws of death, and the reign of Shri Virabhadra would suffer great loss. Moreover, it would be a great harm to the world. Considering all this, the Guru, rejecting Samantabhadra's request, explained to him with great love, "My child, the time for your Sallekhana has not yet come. I have great hope that you will uplift the reign through your actions. My inner voice tells me that you will surely uplift and propagate Dharma. The world also needs you greatly at this time. Therefore, it is my special wish and my command that you go happily wherever and in whatever guise you can obtain food sufficient for the alleviation of your illness, and adopt that guise. After your illness subsides, you should again take Jain Muni Diksha and take care of all your duties. I have complete faith in your devotion and virtues, and therefore I have no hesitation in saying that you can go wherever you want and adopt whatever guise you want. I happily give you permission to do so."
Hearing these sweet and meaningful words of the Guru, and remembering the voice of his own inner conscience, Samantabhadra was convinced that there must be some benefit in this, and therefore he abandoned his thoughts of Sallekhana and, accepting the Guru's command, left with him. 

Page #177:

The Muni-life and the Emergency.

Now Samantabhadra was concerned that if he abandoned the Digambara Muni-vesha, what other attire should he wear, and would that attire be Jain or non-Jain. The thought of abandoning his Muni-vesha brought him sorrow, and he began to think, "How can I wear that other attire which I have always considered to be distorted and unnatural? Will I have to wear it now? Is this the Guruji's command? Yes, this is the command. He has clearly said, 'This is my command,' wear whatever attire you wish, but upon recovery from the illness, you must again take Jain Muni-diksha." Then it should be called irresistible power of destiny. It is true that I do not consider attire (linga) to be everything - I do not consider it to be the sole cause of liberation - it is dependent on the body, and the body is the world of this soul; therefore, a seeker of liberation, who desires to be free from the bonds of the world, cannot have an exclusive attachment to any attire*; yet, I do recognize two distinct categories of attire, distorted and undistorted, and I consider it better for myself to remain in the undistorted attire. Therefore, although... -...tatas tat-siddhyartha param karano grantham ubhayam.
Bhavaneva atyakshina cha vikrita veshopa dhirata. || Swayambhu. * In the Samadhi Tantra of Shri Pujyapada, a similar sentiment is expressed regarding attire; as follows:
Linga dehaashrita drishtam deha eva atmano bhava.
Na muchyante bhavat tasmat te ye linga krita agraha. || 87 || . • That is - Linga (wearing matted hair, nakedness, etc.) is dependent on the body, and the body is the world of the soul, therefore, those who have an exclusive attachment to Linga (attire) - who consider it to be the cause of liberation - do not escape the bonds of the world. 

Page #178:
---------------------------
Swami Samantabhadra, I cannot be interested in that other garb. For me, it would be a kind of *upsarga* (obstacle) and my state would be similar to that of a *chelopasrusht muni* (a monk who has been touched by a woman). But even then, I would be the one who would be responsible for that *upsarga*, wouldn't I? I would have to wear that garb myself! This seems somewhat troublesome to me. Well, if I don't wear another garb, then what is the solution? If I maintain the *munivesh* (monk's garb) and indulge in *svechachar* (self-indulgence) regarding food, etc., then it would shame and taint my *munivesh*, and I cannot do that. I can happily give up my life, but I cannot do anything that would shame or taint my *munivesh* or *munipad* (monkhood) because of me. I cannot, as a Jain monk, engage in any *heenacharan* (low conduct) against that position. Therefore, I will have to abandon my *munipad* out of helplessness. I could become a *kshullka* (layman) by abandoning *munipad*, but even that *ling* (state) is not suitable for obtaining proper food. There are so many rules for that *padadhari* (holder of that position) regarding the renunciation of prescribed food, etc., that even while upholding the dignity of that position, sufficient food cannot be obtained for the treatment of illness. And I cannot violate the dignity. Therefore, I will not wear that garb either. Becoming a householder completely or simply staying under someone's shelter is not desirable for me either. Moreover, my long-standing inclination does not allow me to cause any particular person any hardship for my food. I want to adopt a path that is innocent for my food, in which no one is burdened specifically for me.

The Muni-life and the Emergency.

"There should be no need for any management and food should also be available in abundance." Thinking this or after many such speculations, you renounced your Digambar Muni-vesha with respect and at the same time, with an indifferent attitude, you began to cover your body with holy ashes. The scene at that time was very tragic. While rubbing the ashes on your body, your eyes became a little moist. It was not an ordinary thing for those eyes, which had never been moist even from the intense pain of the ash-disease, to become moist at this time. The hearts of the Muni-people of the Sangha were also filled with seeing you and they were all contemplating the irresistible power of the future and the evil consequences of karma. When Samantabhadra had applied the ashes on his body, seeing the divine light of pure qualities like Samyagdarshana etc. in his outer appearance and inner being, it seemed as if a great radiant gem was being covered with mud and that mud could not enter that gem and could not spoil it in any way* or it seemed as if Samantabhadra had used this 'ash' to burn his ash-fire - to calm it down. So be it. After saluting the Sangha, Samantabhadra now set out from 'Manuvakhalli' like a brave warrior, for the accomplishment of his task.

According to the 'Rajavali Kathe', Samantabhadra left Manuvakhalli and reached 'Kanchi' and there, in the presence of King 'Shivkoti', perhaps his... * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

* He went to the Shiva temple called 'Bhimalinga' and blessed it; the king was amazed to see his auspicious form and, mistaking him for Shiva, prostrated himself before him; when asked about his religious practices, the king told him about his devotion to Shiva, his adherence to Shiva's teachings, the construction of the temple, and his daily offering of twelve 'khandanga' of rice to the Bhimalinga temple. Samantabhadra, saying, "I will offer this food to Shiva," took his seat in the temple with the food, and ordered everyone to leave, closing the door behind them. After everyone had left, Samantabhadra began to offer the food as oblations to Shiva's inner fire, and as he offered the oblations, not a single particle of the food remained. Having attained complete satisfaction, he opened the door. The king was astonished to see that all the food had been consumed. The next day, he offered even better food with even greater devotion, but because his inner fire had been satiated by the previous day's abundant meal, a quarter of the food remained uneaten that day, and on the third day, half the food remained. Samantabhadra generally left this remainder...

1. Regarding how many 'seers' a 'khanduga' is, Shri Nemisagarji, based on a letter from Pandit Shantirajji Shastri of Mysore, has informed us that in the Bangalore region, a 'khanduga' is 200 seers, in the Mysore region, it is 180 seers, in Heggadevanakote, it is 80 seers, and in the Shimoga district, it is 60 seers. The 'seer' is universally 80 'tolas'. It is not known how many seers a 'khanduga' was in Kanchi at that time. It is likely that it was not less than 40 seers.
2. 'Shivarpan' has a deep meaning.

On the fourth day, when even more food was left over, the king's suspicion grew and on the fifth day, he ordered his army to surround the temple and open the door. When there was a lot of noise due to the opening of the door, Samantabhadra experienced an upsurge (upsarga) and, until the upsurge subsided, he renounced all food and drink and, completely abandoning attachment to his body, began to praise the twenty-four Tirthankaras, including Shri Vrishabha, with great devotion and single-minded concentration. While praising, when Samantabhadra had praised the eighth Tirthankara, Shri Chandraprabha Swami, well and looked towards Bhimalinga, he saw, by the power of some divine force, a radiant, golden, large image of the Arhat Bhagwan, with the moon-crest, appearing there, along with vibhuti. Seeing this, Samantabhadra opened the door and became engrossed in praising the remaining Tirthankaras. As soon as the door opened, seeing this great event, King Shiva koti was very surprised and, along with his younger brother 'Shivayana', prostrated himself at the feet of the Yogiraj Shri Samantabhadra. After praising up to Shri Vardhamana Mahavira, Samantabhadra raised his hand and blessed them both. After that, hearing the detailed form of Dharma, the king became detached from worldly possessions, body, and pleasures and, giving his kingdom to his son 'Shrikant', he took Jain initiation along with 'Shivayana' near those Muni Maharajas. And many more...

In this way, Samantabhadra was able to burn away his 'Bhasmaka' disease in a short time, his crisis ended, and after his body returned to its natural state, he again took Jain Muni Diksha.
In an inscription at Shravanabelgola, which was written about eight hundred years ago, there is mention of the pacification of Samantabhadra's 'Bhasmaka' disease, his attainment of a sublime state through divine power, and the attraction of 'Chandraprabha' (image) by his yogic power or power of words, etc. For example:

The Jain path (religion) has become auspicious from all sides in this Kaliyuga, those calculating Acharyas Samantabhadra are worthy of being repeatedly worshipped.
In this introduction, although, there is no name of the king 'Shivakoti'; but the events mentioned in it are related to the 'Shivalaya' of King Shivakoti according to 'Rajavali Kathe' etc. This is also supported by the 'Senaganaki Pattavali'. It also mentions that King Shivakoti was miraculously blessed and initiated by Samantabhadra in the 'Bhimalinga' Shivalaya. He is also mentioned as the 'Maharaja' of the 'Navatilinga' country, whose capital at that time would probably be 'Kanchi'. As

Besides this, the 'Vikrantakaurava' play and the inscription no. 105 (new no. 254) of Shravanabelagola also reveal that 'Shivakoti' was the chief disciple of Samantabhadra. As-Disciple, his two, Trikoti named Shivayana, are the best of the scholars. They have learned the entire scripture at the feet of the Guru, they are fulfilled.

- Shra. Inscription. 
In the verse mentioned in 'Vikranta Kaurava', along with 'Shiva koti', there is also mention of another disciple named 'Shivayana', who is described as the younger brother of 'Shiva koti' in the 'Rajavali Kathe' and it is also revealed that he also received Jain initiation from Samantabhadra along with Shiva koti; * but there is no mention of him in the inscription verse and the reason for this seems to be from the meaning of the verse that this verse is a praise verse for the commentary of the Tattvartha Sutra which was composed by Acharya Shiva koti, therefore the word 'etat' is used before Tattvartha Sutra in it and it is indicated that 'this' Tattvartha Sutra has been adorned by that Shiva koti Suri whose body is a staff for the creeper of penance. It seems that this verse has been quoted from the said commentary in the inscription, and from this point of view, this verse is very ancient and seems to be sufficient to decide that 'Shiva koti' Acharya was a disciple of Swami Samantabhadra + . It is not surprising if this 'Shiva koti' was a king.

The first verse of the Mangalacharan in the Devagam's Vasunandi Vritti is found as follows:

"We bow to the intellect, the one who is the protector of all families, the enemy of the enemy of the soul, the resource of all purposes, the one who cultivates the good path of the Sanyati (Syadvad) ethics, the one who is well-versed in the ocean of conduct, the leader of the ascetics, the one whose rays of knowledge are like the sun, the one who removes the darkness of Vasupala (worldly desires)."

This verse is meaningful, and such meaningful verses are often found in scriptures. The 'Yatipati' who is saluted in this verse for the sake of intellectual growth, seems to refer to 'Shree Vardhaman Swami' in one sense and 'Samantbhadra Swami' in another. All the epithets of the Yatipati fit both of them perfectly. The epithet "the one who cultivates the good path of the Sanyati (Syadvad) ethics, which establishes the 'Akalank' (faultless) state," is similar to the epithets used by Acharyas like Bhattakalankadeva and Shree Vidyānanda for Samantbhadra. Immediately after this verse, in the second verse, which has already been quoted above, Samantbhadra's doctrine is saluted. It seems more likely and appropriate to salute Samantbhadra specifically before saluting his doctrine. Besides this, the Mangal verse given at the end of this Vritti is also meaningful, and in it, the 'Samantbhadradeva', who is the ultimate reality, is clearly saluted.

- It could also be meaningless, and then the Yatipati could also refer to Vasunandi's Guru Nemichandra in the third sense, who, according to the praise of Vasunandi Shravakachar, was the disciple of Nayananda and the disciple of Shreenanda.

It has been done and in another sense the same Samantabhadradeva has been qualified as 'Paramatma'. As
Samantabhadradevaya Paramārtha Vikalpina. Samantabhadradevaya Namostu Paramatmane ||
From all these things, it becomes even more certain that the said 'Yatipati' refers specifically to Samantabhadra. However, among the qualifications of the said Yatipati, 'Bhettaram Vasupalabhavatamah' is also a qualification, which means 'the one who removes the darkness of Vasupala's feelings'. The word 'Vasupala' generally refers to 'king' and therefore, this qualification suggests that Samantabhadra Swami also removed the darkness of feelings of some king. It is very likely that the king was 'Shivakoti' and he was the chief disciple of Samantabhadra. Apart from this, the word 'Vas' means 'Shiva' and 'Pal' means 'king' and in this way, 'Vasupala' can be interpreted as King Shivakoti; but this imagination seems very complicated and therefore we do not want to emphasize it much.
In Brahma Nemidatta's 'Aradhana-Katha-Kosh', there is also a mention of 'King Shivakoti' - in his Shiva temple, there is a mention of the manifestation of the Jinabimba while reading the 'Bhasmaka Vyadhiki Shanti' and the praise of Chandraprabha Jinendra from the Shiva offering - - - along with this, it is also mentioned that Shivakoti

"The Maharaj had taken the Jain initiation. But instead of writing the king of Shivkote, 6 Kanchi or 'Navtailang' country, he has revealed the king of 'Varanasi' (Kashibanaras), this is a difference*.

Now we should see, where does the king of 'Shivkote' prove from history. As far as we have examined the ancient history of India, which has been compiled so far, it seems silent on this subject - there is no achievement of a king named Shivkote - almost nothing is known about the contemporary kings of Banaras. At the very beginning of the historical period - about 600 years before the Christian era - the small principality of Banaras, or Kashi, was merged into the 'Kosala' kingdom, and had apparently lost its independence. After this, in the fourth century BC, the 'Kosala' kingdom was also incorporated into the 'Magadha' kingdom by Ajatashatru, and from that time there is no mention of it as an independent kingdom+. It is probably for this reason that no particular account of the kings or nobles of this small dependent principality is available. As for the kings of Kanchi, in history the most

Firstly, the name of their king 'Vishnugop' (Vishnugop Varma) is found, who was a Vaishnava by religion and who was defeated in battle by 'Samudragupta' around 350 AD. After this, in 437 AD, 'Singhverman' (Buddhist), in 575 Singh Vishnu, from 600 to 625 Mahendravarman, from 625 to 645 Narasimhavarman, in 655 Parameshwarvarman, after this Narasimhavarman II (Rajasingh) and in 740 Nandivarman's name is mentioned. All these kings were of the Pallava dynasty and the order of reign of all the kings from 'Singh Vishnu' onwards is found to be correct. But the chronological list of the kings before Singh Vishnu and their reign period is not found, which was especially needed on this occasion - to determine the Shivakotika. Apart from this, Mr. Vincent Smith, in his 'Early History of India' (pp. 275-276), has also informed that in 220 or 230 AD, 1 Shaka Samvat 380 (458 AD), 'Singhvarman' was the king of Kanchi and this was the 22nd year of his reign, as is known from the Digambar Jain text called 'Lokavibhag'.
2 There was also a Pallava king of Kanchi named 'Shivasakanda Varma', on whose behalf the donation letter of 'Mayidavolu' was written, as informed by Professor A. Chakravarti of Madras in his English preface to 'Panchaastikaya'. According to your information, this king seems to have been around the 1st century AD (even before Vishnugop).

The history of India during the period between 101 and 320 CE is shrouded in darkness, with little to no information available. This clearly indicates that the compiled ancient history of India is incomplete. It is not surprising if the name of an ancient king like Shivkoti is not found in it. Although older history is not available, there has not been a complete effort to compile what is available and what can be found. Jain scriptures in Sanskrit, Prakrit, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and other languages contain a wealth of historical material that has largely been ignored. Furthermore, many kings have had multiple names, and these names have been used in various ways according to preference. This makes it possible that Shivkoti may be mentioned in current history under a different name, and the lack of sufficient information may prevent the two from being equated. This equation requires specific research. However, given the state of history, it cannot be said without thorough research that a king named Shivkoti did not exist, nor can Shivkoti's personality be denied.

* There have been kings with names similar to Shivkoti, such as Shivaskandavarman (Pallava), Shivamargeshvarma (Kadamba), Shivkumar (disciple of Kundakunda), Shivaskandavarman Haritputra (Kadamba), Shivaskand Shatakarni (Andhra), Shivamar (Ganga), Shivshri (Andhra), and Shivdev (Licchavi). It is possible that Shivkoti had a similar name, or that one of these individuals was Shivkoti.

Based on the way Shivakoti is mentioned in the 'Rajavali Kathe' and the support it receives from the Pattavali and inscriptions, we believe that a king named 'Shivakoti' or a person with that identity definitely existed, and the possibility of his existence is mostly found in Kanchi; the fact that Brahmaneimidatta has written him as the king of Varanasi (Kashi-Banaras) does not seem quite right. There are many other things in Brahmaneimidatta's story that do not seem right. This story states that - . . "At that time in Kanchi, there was a lack of (snigdhaadi) food capable of destroying the Bhasmaka Vyadhi, so Samantabhadra left Kanchi and went north. While traveling, he reached 'Pundrendra Nagar', seeing the great almshouse of the Buddhists there, he assumed the form of a Buddhist monk, but when he saw there too, the lack of food suitable for the peace of the Mahavyadhi, he left from there and wandered through many cities suffering from hunger, reaching the city named 'Dashpur'. Seeing the advanced monastery of the Bhagavatas (Vaishnavas) in this city and seeing that the Bhagavata Lingadhari Sadhus were offered abundant special food by the devotees, he abandoned the Buddhist garb and assumed the Bhagavata garb, but even the special food here could not calm his Bhasmaka Vyadhi.
1 'Pund' is the name of North Bengal, which is also called 'Paundravardhana'. 'Pundrendra Nagar' seems to refer to a specific city in North Bengal like Indrapur, Chandrapur or Chandranagar. The printed 'Aradhanakatha Kosh' gives the same text. It is possible that it is somewhat incorrect.

Muni-life and Emergency. 103 And therefore you also left from here. After that, wandering through various countries and places, you reached the city of 'Varanasi' and there you took the Yogilinga and entered the Shiva temple of King Shiva koti. Seeing the group of eighteen types of beautiful and excellent food prepared for Shivaji's offering in this Shiva temple, you thought that my dysentery would definitely be cured here. After that, when the worship was over and that divine food-heap was offered outside, you took the task of feeding Shiva into your own hands by a trick, surprising the people and the king. On this, the king had prepared a variety of divine food mixed with ghee, milk, curd and sweets (ikshu-rasa) etc. in abundance (filled with a hundred pitchers) and entrusted it to the Yogiraj for Shiva's food. Samantabhadra himself ate that food and when he opened the doors of the temple and asked to take out the empty vessels, the king and others were very surprised. It was understood that the Yogiraj had incarnated Shiva himself by his yogic power and fed him this food. This increased the king's devotion and he started sending a group of the best offerings every day. In this way, while consuming excellent food in abundance, when six months passed, your illness completely subsided and due to the naturalization of the amount of food, almost all the offerings started to remain as they were. After that, when the king got the news that the yogi himself was eating that food and did not even bow to 'Shiva', he became angry and asked the yogi the reason for not bowing.

Asked. In reply, the Yogiraj said, "Your ragi-dveshi deva cannot tolerate my namaskar. Only the Jinsurya, who is free from eighteen doshas and is the illuminator of the lokas with his pure knowledge-form, is capable of tolerating my namaskar. If I perform namaskar, your deva (shivalinga) will be shattered - broken into pieces. That is why I do not perform namaskar." The king's curiosity increased and he urged him to perform namaskar, saying, "If this deva is broken into pieces, let it be. I must see the power of your namaskar." Samantabhadra agreed and promised to demonstrate his power the next day. The king said, "So be it," and kept him in the temple, arranging for a full guard outside. After two watches of the night had passed, Samantabhadra became anxious about fulfilling his promise. Ambikadevi's seat shook. She came running and assured Samantabhadra, saying, "Compose the exalted praise of the twenty-four Tirthankaras, beginning with the verse 'Swambhuva Bhutatiten Bhutale'. By its influence, everything will be accomplished quickly and this kulinga will break." Samantabhadra was pleased by this divine vision and, composing the designated praise, he became calm. In the morning (at dawn), the king came and again asked him to demonstrate his power through namaskar. Samantabhadra began to recite his great praise. When he read the verse 'Tamstamore Riv Rashmibhinnam' while praising Chandraprabha Bhagwan, the shivalinga shattered into pieces and a four-faced image of Chandraprabha Bhagwan appeared in that place.

It appeared with great joy. Seeing this, the king and others were greatly surprised, and the king immediately asked Samantabhadra - O Yogiindra, who are you, the great powerful, formless? In response, Samantabhadra spoke the following two verses:
"I was a mendicant in the ten cities, with a body stained with dirt, a dark complexion, a mendicant in the land of the Sakyas, a devotee of the Buddha, a seeker of pleasure.

In Nemidatta's account, the first thing that doesn't seem to make sense is that in a capital city like 'Kanchi' or even in larger cities, towns, and other capitals, there could have been a lack of food suitable for calming the 'Bhasmaka' disease. This is why Samantabhadra had to travel thousands of miles from the far south to the far north. At that time, there were many 'Danashalas' in the south where ascetics were given plenty of food, and countless 'Shivalayas' where similar offerings were made to Shiva. Therefore, the event that happened in Kashi (Banaras) could have happened there as well. In such a situation, it doesn't make sense to travel all the way north to Kashi for food without taking advantage of all these institutions. The story also doesn't mention any specific reason for the lack of sufficient food - generally,

Based on inspiration, the story of Samantabhadra given in both 'Kathakoshas' has been compared and found to be almost identical. You write - "There is no significant difference between the two. Nemidatta's story is almost a complete poetic translation of Prabhachandra's prose story. Some words - adjectives, adverbs, etc. have been added here and there for the sake of completion. In the 11th verse of the story written by Nemidatta, 'Pundrendra Nagare' is written, but in the prose story, 'Pundran Gare' and instead of 'Vandeka - Lokananam Sthane', 'Vandekanam Brihadvihare' is given. In place of 'Baudhalingakam' in the 12th verse, 'Vande - Kalingam' is found. Perhaps 'Vandeka' is a synonym for 'Baudha'. The verses like 'Kanchya Nagma - Tako'ham' etc. are exactly the same. In it, 'Pundroondre' is replaced by 'Pundroondre', 'Kavishaye' is replaced by 'Thakkavishaye', and 'Vaidise' is replaced by 'Vaiduse'. This kind of difference is only in the name. " In such a situation, this summary of Nemidatta's story should also be considered as a summary of Prabhachandra's story and the discussion etc. on it should also be applied to it as much as possible.

"The destruction of the ash-disease by the consumption of food" - this statement is not sufficient. Secondly, it seems somewhat incongruous that a Guru, consuming such a large quantity (equivalent to a hundred pots) of oily, sweet, and phlegmatic heavy substances daily, would still take six months to calm the ash-fire. As far as we understand, and we have consulted some experienced physicians on this matter, this disease cannot persist for such a long time in such favorable food conditions, nor can such a long journey on foot be possible in such a state of the disease. Therefore, the mention of five days in the "Rajavali Katha" does not seem incongruous. Thirdly, the two poems attributed to Samantabhadra, which are said to be introductions to him, seem completely irrelevant. Firstly, the question being asked by the king on that occasion seems out of place - the occasion was for the king to fall at his feet and seek forgiveness. Secondly, Samantabhadra, when urged to greet him, had already given his introduction by stating that he was not a "Shiva worshiper" but a "Jina worshiper". Even if it is considered appropriate to ask such a question for a specific introduction, then in response, Samantabhadra should have given an introduction of his lineage and Guru lineage, or at the most, told the story of his ash-disease, its origin, and its calming through his journey. But none of this is present in the two verses mentioned - there is no mention of lineage or Guru lineage, nor is there any mention of the origin of the ash-disease, etc. - both of them

• There is a clear declaration of a debate; rather, in the second verse, by naming the places where the debate's drum was beaten before, the purpose of this journey is also revealed as 'debate'. Readers should think, was the purpose of Samantabhadra's journey 'debate'? Can it be called polite and civilized behavior for a respected person to be ready to fight and quarrel in response to a question of introduction asked politely by another person, or to declare a debate? And can such an answer be imagined from great men like Samantabhadra? Never. If there had been no declaration of debate in the fourth line of the first verse, that verse could have been made a part of the answer on this occasion; because it mentions Samantabhadra's wearing many different clothes in many places. * But the second verse is completely irrelevant here—it is a verse spoken in the court of the king of 'Karhatak' city, as has been mentioned earlier in 'Gunādi-Parichay'. It is also clearly written there that I have now reached that Karhatak (city) which is full of many scholars, a place of intense learning and full of people. In such a situation, readers can understand for themselves that in response to the king of Banaras' question, it would be said by Samantabhadra that now I am in this Karhatak city
* It has been mentioned that "In Kanchi I became a naked actor (Digambar Sadhu), - there my body was stained with dirt; in Lambush I became a wearer of the Pandupinda form (Sadhu with ashes smeared); in Pundrodar I became a Buddhist monk; in Dashpur city I became a Mrishtbhoji Parivrajaka, and in Varanasi I became an ascetic (Shaiva Sadhu) with a bright Pandura body like Shiva; O King, I am a Jain Nirgranthavadi, whoever has the power to debate with me, let him come forward and debate.

The Muni-life and the emergency. How absurd this is, what a grave mistake, and how much artificiality it brings to the story. It seems that Brahma Nemidatta wanted to somehow incorporate these two ancient verses into the story, and in his zeal for that collection, he did not pay any attention to the meaning of these verses. This is why he was unable to give them adequate space in the story or to compile them properly. His writing, "Sphuṭaṁ kāvyadvayaṁ ceti yogīndraḥ samuvāca saḥ," on this occasion, quoting the said verses, greatly diminishes the glory and naturalness of the story. The very declaration of the debate in these verses suggests that Brahma Nemidatta had a debate with Samantabhadra's solitary ascetics before instilling faith in Jainism among the kings; otherwise, there was no need for it on such a great occasion. It seems that Samantabhadra's journey after Kanchi was also undertaken with the first verse in mind. Although there are some errors in it - there, according to the verse, after Kanchi, there is no mention of Samantabhadra staying in Lambusha in the form of "Paṇḍupinḍa" (with ashes smeared on his body), nor is there any mention of his vow to be a Mṛṣṭabhoji while staying in Daśapura - but let these be. The most important thing is that there is no mention in that verse that suggests that Samantabhadra was afflicted with the disease of ashes at that time or that he was 
1 Some Jain scholars, while interpreting this verse, have given a phrase "due to illness in the body" instead of giving any meaning to the words "malamalina tanulāmbuśe paṇḍupinḍaḥ," which is not correct. In this verse, at one place "paṇḍu

He had adopted these robes for the sake of obtaining what he desired. It is very likely that after the pacification of the 'Bhasmaka' disease in Kanchi, Samantabhadra may not have considered it appropriate to take re-initiation for some time, but rather, for the purpose of spreading the teachings, he may have felt it necessary to travel in that way to get a good understanding of the internal differences of other religions, and the verse refers to that journey, or it may also be that the verse refers to some events from Samantabhadra's life before he became a Nigrantha Muni, which are not found in history and therefore no particular opinion can be formed about them. The verse does not mention any sequential journey or the sequential nature of the events; where is Kanchi and where is the city of Pund in North Bengal! From Pund to near Varanasi, not going there but going to 'Dashpur' near Ujjain and then returning to Varanasi, these things do not indicate a sequential journey. In our opinion, the first thing seems more likely. Therefore, keeping all these things in mind, one cannot readily believe that part of the story of Brahma Nemidatta which relates to travelling from Kanchi to Banaras for food and to the pacification of the Bhasmaka disease in Banaras, especially in a situation where the 'Rajavali Katha' clearly states that in Kanchi 'Pinda' and in the other 'Pandurang' have come, both of which are synonymous and it is clear from them that the robes that Samantabhadra wore in Varanasi were also worn in Lambush. It is a matter of joy that the main author among those writers has acknowledged his mistake in our writing and has considered it his mistake at that time. 

Page #199:

The text describes the story of Samantabhadra, a Jain monk, and his encounter with a fatal illness. It compares this story to another one about a monk named Nemidatta, arguing that the former is more authentic. 

The text highlights several points that make Samantabhadra's story more believable:

* The story describes the monk's illness, his request for the Sallekhana fast (a Jain practice of voluntary death), his guru's refusal, and the monk's eventual recovery.
* It mentions the monk's devotion to Shiva, his daily offerings at a Shiva temple, and his blessings to the king.
* The story details the monk's gradual decline, his eventual renunciation of food, and his continued devotion to Jain teachings.
* It mentions the king's son, Srikantha, and his brother, Shivayana, who both took Jain initiation.
* The text emphasizes that Samantabhadra never spoke disrespectfully of Shiva.

The text contrasts these details with the story of Nemidatta, which it claims is less authentic and more artificial. It points out that the story of Nemidatta lacks the natural progression of events and the detailed descriptions found in Samantabhadra's story. 

Page #200:

Swami Samantabhadra.
And so on, these things are also similar to those which do not appeal to the Jains and seem objectionable. Some scholars, based on this story of Nemidatta, had the opinion that the account of the Jinabimba's manifestation mentioned in it is also probably artificial and seems to have been taken from the story of 'Siddhasena Diwakara' given in 'Prabhavakacharita', with some modifications - in that too, while reciting the praise, the manifestation of the Parshvanatha Bimba is described in the same way. But their opinion was wrong and its refutation is well established by the inscription called 'Mallishena Prasasti' at Shravanabelagola, whose Prakrit verse 'Vandyo Bhasmaka' has been quoted above and which was written 159 years before the said 'Prabhavakacharita' - the time of composition of 'Prabhavakacharita' is VS 1334 and the inscription is written in Shaka Samvat 1050 (VS 1185). This clearly shows that the account of the manifestation of the Chandraprabha Bimba was not taken from the said story but is specifically related to the story of Samantabhadra. Secondly, it is not unnatural for an event of one kind to occur in two places. Yes, it is possible that the matter of urging for prostration etc. may have been taken from the said story. Because there is no support for it from the Rajavali Katha etc.
1 If Prabhachandra Bhattaraka's prose Kathakosa, on the basis of which Nemidatta composed his Kathakosa, was created before 'Prabhavakacharita', then it is also possible that this matter was taken from it in 'Prabhavakacharita'. But without some special evidence regarding the unity etc. of literature, it is not necessary in relation to both that one has copied the other; because it is not impossible for similar thoughts to arise in the hearts of two authors.

It happens, and in relation to Samantabhadra, it seems quite reasonable. For all these reasons, we say that Brahma Nemidatta's writing of 'Shivakoti' as the king of Varanasi does not seem quite right; the possibility of his existence is mostly found in Kanchi, which was the main region of Samantabhadra's residence. So be it.
What Shivakoti did after becoming a disciple of Samantabhadra and what texts he composed, all this is a separate subject that relates to the character or history of Shivakoti Acharya specifically, and therefore we do not consider it appropriate to discuss it here in detail.
There is no doubt that there were many other disciples of Samantabhadra besides 'Shivakoti' and 'Shivayana', but their names have not been found yet, and therefore we have to be content with the names of these two main disciples for now.
Although there is no sufficient means of knowing when or at what stage of their life the 'Bhasmaka' disease arose in Samantabhadra's body, it can be said for sure that it was during their youth, when their guru was also present. Much of their excellence, much of their means of public welfare, the expansion of the influence of Syadvadatiirtha and the unique propagation of Jain rule, all this seems to have happened afterwards. In the 'Rajavali', the attainment of 'Charan Riddhi' by them due to the influence of tapas, and the composition of texts like 'Ratnakarandaka' by them, is also written after the 'Puna:ksha'. Along with this, on this occasion, their special 'Syadvad-vadi'-Syadvad

It is also reported that he was a *Vidya-acharya*. Edward Rice 'Sahib' also writes the same.
It is told of him that in early life he (Samantabhadra) performed severe penance, and on account of a depressing disease was about to make the vow of Sallekhana, or starvation; but was dissuaded by his guru, who foresaw that he would be a great pillar of the Jain faith.  _ That is to say, it is said about Samantabhadra that he performed severe penance in the early stages of his life (Muni life), and due to a depressing or debilitating disease, he was about to take the vow of Sallekhana, or starvation; but his guru, seeing that he would be a very great pillar of the Jain faith, stopped him from doing so.  _ From all this statement so far, we understand that the readers will get a lot of introduction about Samantabhadra and they will be able to understand well that what kind of scholar Swami Samantabhadra was, what kind of excellent maturity he had attained, how great a yogi or Mahatma he was, and how much service he has done to the country, religion and society. Along with this, they will definitely get some understanding of their duty, they will realize their mistakes; they will understand the secret of their failures, they will be inclined towards recognizing the Syadvada path and keeping the ideal of Swami Samantabhadra in front of them, they will try to make their life, their good intentions and efforts successful. And in this way, they will definitely benefit from this holy life story of the Swami.

Swami Samantabhadra adorned and sanctified his existence, this is a question that is still being considered by scholars. Here, some special considerations and decisions are made.
## Alternative Views |
First, in this matter, we mention the views of other scholars and see what arguments they have used to support their own views—

1. Mr. Lewis Rice, in the preface to his book 'Inscriptions at Shravanabelagola', has speculated that Samantabhadra lived in the first or second century AD. He has also stated that according to Jain tradition, Samantabhadra's time of existence is found to be around Shaka Samvat 60 (AD 138)*, and has encouraged looking at the 'Pattavali' which was published on page 320 of Dr. Bhandarkar's report on research into handwritten Sanskrit texts in 1883-84. In other words, it should be said that the saying prevalent among Jains that Samantabhadra lived in the second century Vikram is almost correct, and Rice has given birth to his speculation in support of the same. The basis of your speculation is Shravan

Samantbhadra is mentioned before Simhanandi in the Belgol inscription called 'Mallishena Prasasti' (No. 5467). In your opinion, this prior mention is a very natural inference that Samantbhadra lived before or shortly after Simhanandi. This Simhanandi Muni was particularly instrumental or helpful in the establishment of the Ganga kingdom (Gangawadi), was the guru of the first Ganga king Kongunivarma, and therefore, from the Kongudesharajakkal (Tamil Kanikal) etc., the time of Kongunivarma is found to be the end of the second century AD (A.D. 188), which is also the time of Simhanandi's existence. Since Samantbhadra is mentioned before Simhanandi, he lived before Simhanandi, and therefore his time of existence is estimated to be the first or second century AD. This is the summary of Mr. Rice's inference. *
1 Mr. Rice later found an inscription of Kongunivarma, which is dated Shaka Samvat 25 (A.D. 103) and which he published in 1894 as No. 110 in the inscriptions of the Nanjangud Taluk (Mysore) (E.C. III). From this, the clear time of Kongunivarma is found to be the beginning or early part of the second century AD, and therefore, the time you assumed to be the end of the second century AD on other grounds while publishing the aforementioned book of inscriptions of Shravanabelagola in 1889 should not be considered correct.  _ * Some of Mr. Rice's words in this regard are as follows:
Supposing him (Samantbhadra) to have preceded at a greater or less distance the guru (Simhanandi) next mentioned, and that is the most natural inference, he

_ In our opinion, Mr. Rice's conjecture does not appear to be safe or reasonable. It is possible that Samantabhadra may have lived before Singhnandi, and may have been a scholar of the first century A.D., but the basis on which Mr. Rice has created this conjecture is not strong; for this, first of all, it is necessary to prove that all the gurus mentioned in the said inscription have occurred in chronological order, or that Singhnandi is mentioned after Samantabhadra or in his lineage. But this is not proven - neither does the inscription appear to be of that nature, nor does it indicate Singhnandi's later existence by words like 'tatah' or 'tadanyaye' - in it, the remembrance of many gurus is found in a random order. For example, take 'Pantrkesari' Vidyānanda, who has strengthened Akalankadev's 'Ashta-shati' with his 'Ashta-sahasri' and who is a scholar of the 9th century A.D. His remembrance is not only before Akalankadev, but also before 'Srivardhadeva'. Srivardhadeva has also been praised by the poet named 'Dandi', who is a scholar of the 6th century A.D. and his
might, in connection with the remarks made below, be placed in the 1st or 2nd century A.D................ :. There is accordingly no reason why Sinha nandi should not be placed at the end of the 2nd century A.D.
1 For the fact that Pantrkesari and Vidyānanda were the same person, see the 'Samyattvaprakash' text, and the 'Jnan Suryodaya' play by Vadi Chandrasur or 'Jain Hitaishi' part 9, issue 9, pages 439-440. The following sentence from Samyattvaprakash itself shows that both are one person - "Tatha sloka-vartike Vidyānandya-paranāma-pātra-kesari-svāminā yaduktam taccha likhyate-."

The verses praising him are mentioned in the said inscription. This clearly indicates that Shri Vardhadeva was a very ancient Acharya and he lived many centuries before Patrakesari. Yet, the remembrance of Patrakesari even before him clearly indicates that no rule was followed in the inscription regarding the remembrance of the Gurus in chronological order. Therefore, it cannot be said that Samantabhadra lived before Singhanandi just because his name is mentioned before Singhanandi in the inscription. As for the 'Pattavali', although it is not available to us, we can definitely say that Pattavalis are generally written later based on prevalent traditions or legends, etc. They lack evidence and logic, and therefore, such complex issues cannot be decided solely on their basis - they are often inadequate regarding the order and time of the more ancient Gurus.

2 - The author of the Kannada book called 'Karnataka-Kavi-Charite' (Messrs R & S G Narasimhachar) believes that Samantabhadra lived around Saka Samvat 60 (AD 138), as mentioned by Pandit Nathuramji in his book 'Karnataka-Jain-Kavi', which is mostly based on the said Kannada book. However, there is no mention of the basis for this assumption. It seems that it is based on the said Pattavali: or

It is said that this period, in history, begins with the Rashtrakuta king 'Dantidurga' and it is from here that the special rise of the Rashtrakutas is mentioned. Before this, there were three other kings named Indra (II), Kark (I), and Govinda (I), whose reign periods etc. are not known. It seems that their kingdom did not remain in the same order and they were not any particularly influential kings. Dr. R.G. Bhandarkar, in his 'Early History of Deccan', has, on the basis of the donation letters found till then, declared the said Govinda (I) to be the most ancient king of this dynasty*. He has also revealed that the inscription of Ravikirti of 'Aihole' (Shaka Samvat 556) which mentions a king Govinda who attacked the Chalukya king Pulakeshi (II) is probably this Govinda I. In such a situation - when there is no proper knowledge of the ancient history of this dynasty - it does not seem reasonable to say that Samantabhadra attained prominence during the reign of the ancient Rashtrakutas or that they became established at that time. If it is assumed that the intention of Mr. Iyengar's statement is that Samantabhadra was during the reign of king Dantidurga or it is accepted that he was contemporary with Govinda I and therefore his time of existence, according to Mr. Bhandarkar's information, is the same Shaka Samvat

556 (AD 634) is the time of the inscription mentioned by Ravikirti, then this fact contradicts your statement on pages 30-31 of the book, where you have stated that after Samantabhadra, many Jain monks took up the work of proselytism, and in those monks, as a prime example, you have mentioned the names of 'Singhanandi', the founder of Gangawadi (Gangarajya), first, and then 'Puzyapad', 'Akalankdev'. Because Singhanandimunika, as has been stated earlier, is considered to be from the beginning or the earlier part of the second century AD along with Kongunivarma, and Puzyapad also lived about a century before the time of Govinda I. Therefore, either it should be said that Samantabhadra lived before Singhanandi (in the first or second century AD) or it should be argued that he was contemporary with the ancient Rashtrakutas (around the first half of the seventh century AD or the latter half of the eighth century AD). Both things cannot be together. As far as we understand, Mr. Aiyangar has also considered the time of Samantabhadra to be before Singhanandi, according to Mr. Lewis Rice, and his mention of him as contemporary with the ancient Rashtrakutas is based on some mistake or error. This is the reason why he has also given space to the communal statement of the Jains of Shaka Samvat 60 without any objection. If this is not the case, but

The claim that Samantabhadra existed before Singhanandi and Pujyapada is incorrect. If they truly believe Samantabhadra was a scholar from 750 AD or later, we have no hesitation in saying that this belief is completely baseless and lacks any support.
4 - In "History of the Medieval School of Indian Logic," Dr. Satishchandra Vidyabhushan, MA, has expressed his opinion that Samantabhadra flourished around 600 AD. However, the basis for this assumption, or the reasons that compelled you to make such an assumption, are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that Samantabhadra is also mentioned by the Hindu philosopher "Kumaril" and refers to page 118 of Dr. Bhandarkar's report on Sanskrit texts, which we have already mentioned in No. 1. It is also stated that "Kumaril" was a contemporary of the Buddhist logician Dharmakirti, and his lifetime is generally considered to be the 7th century AD. Perhaps the mention of Samantabhadra in this text led you to believe that he was a scholar from a slightly earlier period. If so,
* Samantabhadra is supposed to have flourished about 600 A. D.
it was necessary to mention that Kumaril's Samantabhadra was a contemporary of Kumaril; because other scholars believe that Samantabhadra existed in the 1st or 2nd century AD.

Your assumption does not seem reasonable at all. What guarantee is there in the mere mention of the fact that Samantabhadra was not much earlier than Kumaril but only a short time before him! Special evidence was needed to prove this, which is lacking in the said book.
In the case of Dharmakirti, Vidyabhusanji has stated the clear time of Dharmakirti (possibly the time of Dharmakirti's establishment in the Acharya position) as around 635 to 650 AD and has mentioned three things in support of this time - one is that Dharmakirti's guru Dharmapal was alive in 635 AD, his existence is known till this year, so Dharmakirti should also be present around that time; secondly, Dharmakirti was a contemporary of the Tibetan king 'Sron-Sgampo', whose existence is found from 627 to 698 AD, and Dharmakirti's time coincides with this time; thirdly, the Chinese traveler 'I-tsing' traveled to India between 671 and 695 AD; he (in his travelogue) clearly states how 'Dharmakirti made further progress in logic after 'Dignaga'. Apart from this, after Dharmakirti's Buddhist initiation, Vidyabhusanji has also revealed that Dharmakirti performed Tirtha
1 In the same year 635; when the Chinese traveler Xuanzang reached the Nalanda University, his disciple, Silabhadra, had been established in the main position in place of the said Dharmapal; this is found from Vidyabhusanji's said book.

(System) With a desire to gain knowledge of the secret principles, he traveled to the south in the guise of a slave. There, learning that Kumaril Brahmana was the unparalleled scholar in this subject, he placed himself in his service and, pleasing him with his service, learned the secret principles of that philosophy. From all this statement, it clearly emerges that Dharmakirti had reached Kumaril's service before 635, and at that time Kumaril would not have been old, but would have been about 40 years old. In such a situation, Kumaril's time goes back to around 600 AD, and this is the time, as mentioned above, by Samantabhadra. In other words, it should be said that Vidyabhusanji has, in fact, declared Samantabhadra and Kumaril to be almost contemporaries. But Kumaril, in his 'Shloka Vartika', has made some sarcastic remarks on Akalankadev's 'Ashta Shati' text, taking his 'Agyapradhana Hi...' etc. sentences, as Professor K.B. Pathak informs in his essay 'Kumaril's Place in Digambar Jain Literature', and also reveals that Kumaril lived for some time after Akalanka, so the objections that Kumaril made on the sentences of Ashta Shati could not be answered by Akalanka himself, that work had to be done later by Akalanka's disciples (Vidyānanda and Prabhāchandra). The said 'Shati' text is a commentary on Samantabhadra's 'Devagam' stotra, this has already been made clear. From this, the reader can understand for himself that on a commentary made many centuries after the text of Samantabhadra, the commentator's

Often in old age, when Kumaril criticizes, how far behind is he from Samantabhadra, and how far can it be justified to consider him almost contemporary with Samantabhadra. It seems that Vidyabhusanji did not have the opportunity to see Kumaril's said 'Shloka Vartika'. This is the reason why he has written Akalankadev as a scholar behind Kumaril - around 750 AD! If he had seen the said text, he would have written the time of Akalankadev around 640 instead of 750, and then your statement would seem almost in line with the following verse of 'Akalankacharit', which states that 'in Vikram Samvat 700 (AD 643), Akalanka Yati had a great debate with the Buddhists -
Vikramarak - Shakaabdi - Shatasapt - Pramajushi. Kale Kalank-Yatino Bauddhairvado Mahanabhoot ||
And there is almost the same situation regarding the time determination of Vidyabhusanji regarding many other Jain scholars - it is based on some special researchers
1 Some scholars have equated the 'Sahasatung' king mentioned in Akalankadev's 'Rajansahasatung' etc. verses with the Rashtrakuta king Krishna Raja I (Shubhatung), and considered Akalankadev as his contemporary - almost in the latter half of the 8th century AD; but if Kumaril was contemporary with Kirtika according to Dr. Satishchandra, then the time of Akalankadev's existence seems to be this VS. 700 only, and then it will have to be said that the equation made with Krishna Raja of 'Sahasatung' is not correct. Lewis Rice, without making such an equation, has shown himself unable to identify Sahasatung.
2 This verse is quoted in the preface of 'Inscriptions at Shravanabelagola' (Epigraphia Karnatika Volume Second), (1923), by Mr. R. Narasimhacharaya with the said intention.

-The author's statement about the time of Dharmabhushan does not seem to be accurate. He has given the time of Dharmabhushan as around 1600 AD, but his Nyayadipika was written in Saka Samvat 1307, as Professor K.B. Pathak has stated in his essay based on 'South Indian Inscriptions Volume 1, page 156'. In this situation, you should have given the time of Dharmabhushan as 1385 AD or 'around 1400'; but instead of doing so, you have declared Dharmabhushan a scholar from 200 years before his actual time and written that he wrote Nyayadipika around 300 years ago (instead of 532)! This clearly shows that Vidyabhusanji did not make any special effort to find out the correct time of the Jain scholar, and therefore his statement on this subject, which is not accompanied by any special arguments, does not seem to be very credible. In many places, it appears to be very misleading. Readers will have a better understanding of how misleading your statement about the existence of Samantabhadra is in the future.

5 - Some scholars believe that Swami Samantabhadra came before Siddhasena Divakar. If Siddhasena was one of the nine gems in the court of King Vikramaditya and is therefore considered a scholar of the first century of the Vikram era, then Samantabhadra should be a scholar from before him - even before the first century AD - because the following verse from Samantabhadra's 'Ratnakarandaka' is quoted in Siddhasena's 'Nyayavtar'

127. Not transgressing the knowledge of the Aapta, not contradictory to what is seen and heard,
The teaching of the truth, the scripture, the clash of hypocrisy. ||9|| There is no doubt that this verse is from Samantabhadra's 'Ratnakarandaka', a study of the Upasaka (Shravaka-achara), where it is found in its proper place, in its proper order, and in its original form, and is a very essential part of it. If this verse is removed from the said text, the sequence of its statement will be disrupted. Because in the text, the Aapta, the Agamas, the Tapobhrit, with their eight limbs and without the three kinds of ignorance, have been shown to the Shraddhanas with the right vision, and in sequence, their nature has been described, before this verse the nature of the Aapta has been given, and after this the nature of the Tapobhrit has been given; this verse is situated in its place between the two, and is the only verse on its subject. On the contrary, in the Nyaya-avatar, the position of this verse seems very doubtful. It does not seem to be an essential part of it, nor does its removal cause any hindrance in the sequence of the text or in its subject matter. In the text, while stating the two divisions of indirect evidence, 'Anumana' and 'Shabda', after stating and supporting the Swarthanumana, this verse, which is the characteristic of the 'Shabda' evidence, is given just before this verse:
From the words that are not contradicted by what is seen and heard, which declare the ultimate truth.
The belief that arises from the understanding of the truth is called Shabda. ||8|| 1 This verse is given at number 9 in both the texts, and this is the result of a coincidental event.
2 In the commentary, this introductory sentence is given before this verse:

The above verse, which follows this verse and describes the characteristics of scripture (agama), is useless for several reasons. Firstly, it does not describe the characteristics of scripture in accordance with agama pramana. It does not explain whether the knowledge arising from such scripture is called agama pramana or shabda pramana, but rather it is generally designated as an agama substance, which is described in the 'Ratnakarandaka' as the subject of right faith. Secondly, shastra pramana is not a separate entity from shabda pramana, which needs to be mentioned separately after shabda pramana, but rather it is included within it. The commentator, by imagining two divisions of shabda, 'laukik' and 'shastraja', has indicated that the characteristics of both are included in this eighth verse; *this makes it even clearer that the 'shastraja' division of shabda is not mentioned in the ninth verse. Thirdly, the word 'shastra' or 'agama' has not been used anywhere in the entire text before this, which this ninth verse is understood to be the defining characteristic of, nor is there any indication in the original text of a division called 'shastraja', of which this verse could be the defining characteristic of one element (shastra); fourthly, if it is said
"Therefore, having described the characteristics of self-inference, now, to refute the error and misunderstanding of those who hold such views, and because the characteristics of inferred objects are briefly mentioned, the characteristics of shabda are now stated."
1. 'Nyaya Avatara' has described the characteristics of pramana in its first verse as being non-obstructed knowledge that is self-illuminating, therefore, it should be applicable to every division of pramana.
* 'Shabda is of two types - laukik and shastraja. This verse describes the common characteristics of both.'

If the sentence from which the 'Shaabd' evidence arose in the 8th verse is described as 'Shastra' in the next verse, then this also does not work; because the nature of the sentence has already been given in the 8th verse itself by the adjectives 'Drishteshtavyahat' etc., and that nature is almost similar to the nature of the Shastra given in the next verse - its 'Drishteshtavyahat' is similar to 'Adrishteshtavirodhak' and it also includes the adjectives 'Anullangya' and 'Aptopanya', the adjective 'Paramarthaabhidhay' is indicative of the meaning of 'Kapathghattan' and 'Sarv' adjectives, and the 'Shaabdpraman' 'Tattvagrahityotpanna' statement clearly indicates that the sentence is considered 'Tattvopadeshakrit' - in this way, a lot of similarity is found between the two verses. In such a situation, there is no reason for the author to repeat the same thing unnecessarily, especially in a text that is written in carefully chosen words in the form of sutras. Fifth, the author himself has described the sentence as 'Pararthanuman' in the next verse by way of treatment; as
Svanishchayavadanyesham nishchayotpadanam budhai:
Parartham manamaakhyatam vakyam tadupacaratha: || 10 ||
From the collection of all these things or reasons, it is clear that the position of the verse called 'Aptopanya' in 'Nyayaavataar' is very doubtful, it does not seem to be the verse of the original author, its position in the middle of the subsequent verses becomes unnecessary before accepting it as an essential part of the text written by the original author, the style of presentation of the text also does not accept it,

And for this reason, he must know a quoted verse. Before the commentator gives it, by imagining two distinctions of the word 'laukik' and 'shastraj', he writes in the form of a preface that 'the way in which the shastraj evidence, which originated from the shastra, obtains evidence, is now shown by the author of the book' * This is just the commentator's attempt to harmonize this verse with the other verses of the book. Otherwise, the original author does not seem to have such a distinction, nor is there any method of statement in the book based on such a concept, and there is no need to give the shastra a separate form after stating the nature of the sentence in the 8th verse. If they did so, they would surely give the characteristics of that apt in their book, like other books, from which the shastra or a particular sentence originates, and on whose distinction and evidence the distinction or authority of that shastra or sentence is often dependent; but throughout the book, there is not even a mangalacharan that is indicative of the general nature of the apt, let alone its characteristics. This makes it clear that the author has not made such concepts and special statements.
1' The distinction of the name shastraj with 'laukik' does not seem to be good or appropriate, it should have been 'lokoत्तर'. In the Shwetambar text called 'Pramananyatattvalokalan - kar', the word of the apt which is called agam has been divided into two distinctions, laukik and lokoत्तर (sa cha dvedha laukiko lokoत्तरश्च), and therefore, the aptvakya and the shabda praman or agam praman arising from the aptvakya should also have the same two distinctions, laukik and lokoत्तर. Here, the name distinction shastraj seems to have been imagined by the commentator only to harmonize the next verse with the book.

Although his treatise is mostly kept separate, he has generally mentioned in this treatise the same famous system of proof that everyone uses, and for this reason this verse also seems to be quoted in the treatise. If the author has indeed quoted this verse in the form of 'Uktan Cha' to support the form of the sentence given in the eighth verse of the treatise, then there can be no hesitation in saying that Siddhasena must have come after Samantabhadra. But, as far as we understand, the type of scholar that Siddhasena Divakara was and the way (method) in which he started and ended his treatise, it is very unlikely that Siddhasena would have quoted this verse - it does not even occur to us that a scholar like Siddhasena would have considered it appropriate to quote the words of another scholar in his small sutra treatise in the form of 'Uktan Cha'. In our opinion, this verse was either quoted in some other old commentary of the treatise, while explaining the 'sentence', or some scholar has quoted it there while commenting on the word 'sentence' that came in the 8th or 10th verse, and from the same commentary or commentary-containing copy, while copying the original treatise, due to the carelessness or ignorance of the writers, it has been interpolated in the treatise and has become a part of the treatise. It is not unusual for a verse to be interpolated in this way - there are many examples of verses interpolated in this way in treatises. This

It is a **Kshepaka** (interpolation) for the reason given.
Considering the position, etc., of this verse in the **Nyaya-avtar**, we are of the opinion that this verse is an interpolation there, and has been interpolated in the present text from an earlier text, which some scholars say was composed by Chandraprabhasuri (Vikrama Samvat 1159) and some by Siddharsi (Samvat 962). Thus, if this verse is considered as an interpolation, the number of verses in the text will be 31. Some people may object to this by saying that it is said about Siddhasena that he wrote 32 **Dvatrinshad-dvatrinshika** (collections of 32 verses each), of which **Nyaya-avtar** is one **Dvatrinshika** - its number of verses should also be 32, and therefore considering the above verse as an interpolation will create a problem in the size of the text. But there is actually no place for such an objection. Firstly, **Nyaya-avtar** is not a **stuti-grantha** (hymn) at all, it does not even have a **mangalacharan** (invocation) and no statement is made addressing the Supreme Being. Secondly, no ancient (before the commentary) mention is found from which it is found that **Nyaya-avtar** is a **Dvatrinshika** or that its verses have a fixed number of 32; and thirdly, 20 or 21 **Dvatrinshika** of Siddhasena are generally found together, only in one copy the 21st **Dvatrinshika** is also found together, as the publishers have informed; and that 21st **Dvatrinshika** appears doubtful from its literature; therefore the word 'or' is used here. 
1 Siddhasena Divakara's 20 **Dvatrinshika** are generally found together, only in one copy the 21st **Dvatrinshika** is also found together, as the publishers have informed; and that 21st **Dvatrinshika** appears doubtful from its literature; therefore the word 'or' is used here.

133. The 'Dvaatrimshikaas' do not follow a rule of 32 verses in all of them - in the eighth Dvaatrimshika there are 26, in the eleventh 28, in the fifteenth 31, in the nineteenth also 31, in the tenth 34 and in the twenty-first 33 verses are found. In such a situation, no insistence can be made for 32 verses for the 'Nyaaayaavaataar', and it cannot be said that 31 verses pose any obstacle to its quantity.
Now it should be seen when Siddhasena Diwaakar happened and whether Samantabhadra happened before him or not. It is said that Siddhasena Diwaakar was one of the nine gems of the court of King Vikramaditya of Ujjayini, and the following verse from the 'Jyotirvidaabharan' text is presented for the names of those nine gems:
Dhanvantari: Kshapanako'marasinghasankurvetalabhattaghatkhaparakaliidaasaah. Khyaato vaarahamihiro nripateh sabhaayaam ratnaani vai vararuchi nava vikramasya ||
In this verse, although, there is no mention of the name 'Siddhasena', but the scholar named 'Kshapanak' who is mentioned is considered to be 'Siddhasena Diwaakar'. Dr. Satishchandra Vidyabhusan, while mentioning his belief in this matter, writes to this extent that 'the Kshapanak (Jain monk) whom the Hindus consider to be one of the nine gems adorning the court of Vikramaditya is none other than Siddhasena.

There was no other scholar*. He also states that Buddhist texts refer to Jain monks as 'Kshapanaka', and cites two verses from the 'Avadanakalpalata'+ for proof.
And in this way he has indicated that the scholar named 'Kshapanaka' was not a Buddhist monk. There is no doubt that 'Kshapanaka' refers to Jain monks. If these Kshapanaka scholars were indeed in the court of Siddhasena Vikramaditya and were therefore contemporaries of Varahamihira, then their time appears to be around the 6th century AD.

He passed away in 135 and 587 AD. Therefore, Dr. Satishchandra, in his book 'History of Medieval Justice', has considered Siddhasena to be a scholar around 533 AD, and in the preface of Nyayavtar, around 550 AD, and regarding the Vikramaditya of Ujjaini, he has accepted the opinion of those scholars who have equated Vikramaditya* with King Yashodharmadeva of Malwa, who, according to Al-Biruni, defeated the Huns at Korur in 533 AD. In such a situation, it is clear that Siddhasena Diwakar was not a scholar of the first century of Vikram, but a scholar of his sixth century or the fifth and sixth centuries AD. In this regard, Muni Jinavijayaji writes on page 82 of Jain Sahitya Sanshodhak, second issue,
"Siddhasena has passed away long before the 6th century AD. Because Acharya Mallavadi, who happened in the fifth century of Vikram, had written a commentary on Siddhasena's Sammatitarka. In our opinion, Siddhasena happened in the first century of Vikram."

It is true that in the Svetambara sect, Acharya Malluvadi is written as a scholar of Vira Samvat 884+ and based on that, Muni Ji has presented him as a scholar of the fifth century of Vikram. But Acharya Malluvadi wrote a commentary called 'Dharmoत्तर-tippanak' on the 'Nyayavindu-tika' of the Buddhist Acharya 'Dharmoत्तर', and Acharya Dharmoत्तर was a scholar of the 9th century AD (around 837-847 AD), therefore it is impossible for Malluvadi to be in Vira Samvat 884; Dr. Satishchandra informs this in his history of medieval Nyaya. He also states that this Samvat 884 is not Vira Samvat, but either Vikram Samvat or Saka Samvat.

Scholars of the past century should be understood.* From this, the statement made by Muni Ji based on the time of the Mallavas, that Siddhasena Vikram was before the fifth century, does not seem correct.
No other strong evidence has yet been found to establish the time of Siddhasena before the fifth and sixth centuries AD, and if we accept the sixth or fifth century, we have no hesitation in saying that Samantabhadra was much before Siddhasena Divakara, as the readers will know later.  _ It seems appropriate to reveal here that Siddhasena has been written as a scholar of the Svetambara sect by Vidyabhusanji.

Apart from this, it is also possible that the beginning of Varahamihira's youth is the time of Kshapanaka's old age, therefore, the fifth century has also been accepted here for the existence of Siddhasena.

Sen's belief is that in the Digambara lineage - Guruparampara - there is also the name Siddhasena. Many Digambara Acharyas have praised Siddhasena specifically, and from the literature of their texts, there is no specific mention of a Shvetambara. Therefore, you must have used some tactics to write that, or you should have mentioned the beliefs of both sects in this matter. But there is a complete lack of both these things, and therefore our above opinion is correct.

As for the word "Kshapanaka," while it generally refers to a Jain monk, it is not specifically a marker for a Shvetambara monk. Rather, it has been used for Digambara monks since ancient times. In ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts, it is used for Nirgrantha - Digambara monks. Even Shvetambara texts have used it for Digambara monks, an example of which is given below.

1. In the "Senagana" lineage, "Siddhasena" is mentioned as follows:

(Svasti) Shrimad Ujjayini Mahima Kalasansthapan Mahakalaling Mahadhar Vagvandandavishtaghaviskrut Shri Pashvatireshwar Pratidvandva Shri Siddhasena Bhattarakanam. - Jain Si. Bha., First Kiran.

"Susiddhaseno'bhayabhimasenako guru parau tau jin-shantishenakau." - Harivansha Purana

He is described as a "Digambar Jati" in the Gujarati introduction. The term "Kshapanakanu" refers to Digambar ascetics. This is further clarified by the following verse from Munisundar Suri's "Gurvavali", which gives the meaning or sentiment of this verse and uses the term "Digvasanan" in place of "Kshapanakan":

"Khomana-bhubhrut-kula-jastato'bhoot samudra-surih sva-vasham guru: | Chakara naga-hada-parshva-tirtham vidya-ambudhir digvasanan-vijittya || 39 ||"

Similarly, other Svetambar texts like "Pravachanapariksha" refer to Digambars as "Kshapanak". Now let's take an example from Digambar texts:

"Tarunam-u budhau ruyadau surau pandiu dinchhu | Khavanau vandau sevadau mudhau mannai sabbu || 83 ||"

This verse is from "Paramatma Prakash" by Yogindradev. It explains from the perspective of "Nischya Nay" that "He is a fool who (despite being different from the nature of youth, old age, etc., and being dependent on the results of the vibhava) believes that I am young, old, handsome, brave, wise, divine, Kshapanak (Digambar), Vandak (Buddhist), or Svetapat (Svetambar). Here, the mention of Kshapanak, Vandak, and Vatapat together makes it absolutely clear that the term "Kshapanak" is specifically used for Digambars.

Besides this, the Svetambara Acharya Hemachandra and the Digambara Acharya Shridharasen have given the meaning of the word 'naked' as 'Kshapanaka' in their respective lexicons. 'Nano vivasasi magadhe cha kshapanake.' (Hemachandra) 'Namastraishu vivasatre syatpunsi kshapanavandinoh.' (Shridharasen) And from this, it is clear that when the word 'Kshapanaka' is used for a monk, it means 'naked or Digambara monk'.

Given the state of the word 'Kshapanaka', it seems quite objectionable and not without doubt to call the 'Kshapanaka' Ratna of Vikramaditya's court a Svetambara.

Whether Siddhasen was a Digambara or a Svetambara is a separate issue altogether and we want to clarify it through a separate article. We will definitely try to do so when the opportunity arises. Pujyapada - Time.

After criticizing the arguments of other scholars, we now see when Swami Samantabhadra lived. It is undisputed that Samantabhadra, the author of Jainendravyakarana and Sarvarthasiddhi etc., lived before 'Devanandi', another name for 'Pujyapada Acharya'. The inscription at Shravanabelagola also mentions Samantabhadra as a scholar who lived before Pujyapada. After the introductory verse of Samantabhadra in the 40th inscription, the word 'Tata:' is written...

-The introduction of Pujyapada is given by 'Yo Devanandiprathamabhidhanah' etc., and in the 108th inscription, the first verse introducing Pujyapada after Samantabhadra uses the word 'tatah', thus indicating that Pujyapada was a scholar after Samantabhadra. Besides this, Pujyapada himself mentions Samantabhadra in the following sutra of his "Jainendra" grammar: 'Chatushtyam Samantabhadrasya.' 5-4-140.
I
From all these mentions, it becomes even clearer that Samantabhadra preceded Pujyapada. Pujyapada wrote a commentary called "Shabdavitar" on the "Paniniya" grammar and was the preceptor of Gangaraja "Durvi-ni"; this is found in the Hebbur copperplate inscription, some volumes of "Epigraphia Carnatica", "Karnatakakavicharite" and "History of Kannada Literature". It is also known that the reign of King "Durvinita" lasted from 482 to 522 AD. Therefore, Pujyapada was born in 482 AD.
1 The first verse of the introduction of Pujyapada is as follows:
Shri Pujyapadoddhritadharmarajyastato Suradhiswarapujyapadah. Yadiy-vaidushya gunanidaniam vadanti shastraniti taduddhritani.
2 The fact that Pujyapada wrote a commentary called "Shabdavatar" is also found in the following sentence of the 46th inscription (E.C. VIII) of the "Nagar" taluk:
Nyasam Jainendrasanjam sakalabudhanutam Paniniyasyabhuyo-nyasam Shabdavataram manujatatihitam vaidhyashastram cha kritva. Yastattvarthasyatikaam vyarachayadiha tam bhatyasau Pujyapadaswami bupalavandya svarahitavachah purnahridayabodhavrittah.

Time-Determination. It is clear that there were scholars even before that. What Dr. Bühler has written about you as a scholar of the fifth century AD is correct. A disciple of Pujyapada, 'Vajranandi', established the 'Dravida' Sangha in VS 526 (AD 470), which is mentioned in Devasena's 'Darsanasara' text*. This suggests that Pujyapada was present during the reign of 'Avinita', the father of the 'Durvinita' king, which began in AD 430 and lasted until 482. It also appears that when the Dravida Sangha was established by a disciple of Pujyapada, Pujyapada would have been around 40 years old at the time of its establishment, and he would have begun writing his texts around AD 450. In such a situation, there is no hesitation in saying that Samantabhadra lived before AD 450. However, how much earlier he lived is still a matter of consideration. There are great difficulties in giving a proper and true answer to this question. The lack of sufficient resources is very much felt here. And therefore, although there is no definitive answer to this topic,

The answer cannot be given right now, but considering the events that have come to light in this regard and the time, manner, or understanding that arises from them, it seems appropriate to present all of this to the readers. This will enable the readers to understand the situation and be able to determine the exact time through further research, or provide the author with specific information for a definitive decision.

## Umasvati's Time

**(a)** While introducing Samantabhadra from the inscription at Shravanabelagola, it has already been stated that Samantabhadra came after Acharya Umasvati and his disciple Balakapichcha. If the definite time of Umasvati or his disciple were known, then the approximate time of Samantabhadra could be easily determined. Or, it could be easily said that Samantabhadra lived sometime between after that time and before 450 CE. However, the time of Umasvati has not yet been definitively established - his situation is almost the same as that of Samantabhadra, and therefore, no definitive statement can be made about the actual time of Samantabhadra based on the uncertain time of Umasvati.

**(b)** In the lineage of the Nandishanga, the time of Umasvati's ascension to the position of Acharya is given as 101 VS (Vikram Samvat). It is also written that he remained in the position of Acharya for 40 years and 8 months, his lifespan was 84 years, and in 142 VS, Lohacharaya...

The second one is established. In many inscriptions of Shravanabelagola, 'Balakapichcha' is mentioned as the chief disciple of Umaswati, the disciple lineage of Balakapichcha is also mentioned, and here the name of Lohacary is found in his place. In this regard, although it can be said that Balakapichcha will be the name of Lohacary - like the name of Umaswati - 'Grdhrapichcha' - or Lohacary will be some other disciple of Umaswati, yet this lineage cannot be readily believed. In this, the time and order of ancient Acharyas is found to be very messed up. For example, take the time of Pujyapada (Devanandi), in the lineage it is given from VS 258 to 308. In other words, it should be said that the lineage mentions the time of Pujyapada's establishment on the Acharya position to be around AD 200; but as it has been shown above from history, it is found to be around 450, and therefore there is a huge difference of about two hundred and fifty (250) years between the two. In history, there is mention of Pujyapada's disciple Vajranandi, and it is also mentioned that he established the 'Dravid' Sangha in VS 526, but in the lineage, after Pujyapada, the names of two Acharyas (Jayanandi and Gunanandi) are mentioned, and Vajranandi's name is given at number four (13), and along with it
1 See, inscriptions no. 40, 42, 43, 47, 50, 105 and 108.
2 This real name is not even known; it seems that this name became famous because of keeping the tail of Balak (Bak, Sarus). His guru used to keep the tail of Grdhra. From this, it does not seem that there was any special demand for the peacock's tail at that time.

His time is also mentioned as being from Vikrama Samvat 364 to 386. There is a very large difference between these two times, along with the difference in order. From history, the time of Vasunandi is known to be in the 12th century of Vikrama, but in the lineage, it is given as the 6th century (525-531). In this way, upon examination, the time, etc., of many Acharyas is found to be incorrect in this lineage, which does not need to be elaborated upon here to give this essay more weight. In such a situation, the reader can understand for themselves how doubtful this lineage is and how the time, etc., of anyone can be decided based on it alone. Professor Hernell, Dr. Peterson, and Dr. Satishchandra have written that Umasvati was a scholar of the first century CE based on this lineage, and it seems that they did not do any special examination of this lineage - they simply accepted it based on its appearance. Thus, if the time of Umasvati given in the lineage is correct, then the time of existence of Samantabhadra can be estimated to be approximately 40 years away from it - this 40-year difference can be from the beginning of one's time to the beginning of the other's time or from the end of one's time to the end of the other's time, and then Dr. Bhandarkar

The time of Samantabhadra mentioned in the report of the Karaki, which is said to be around Saka Samvat 60 (Vikram Samvat 195) or generally considered to be the second century of Vikram, can also be said to be correct.
(c) In 'Vidvajjanabodhaka', the following verse is written as the famous verse describing the time of Umasvati (Umasvami) and it has been indicated by it that Acharya Umasvati happened 770 years after the Nirvana of the hero or his time limit is 770 years.
"Sapta chaiva sapta tyacha vismritau. Umasvamimunirjatha: Kundakunda tathaiva cha."
If the currently prevalent Veer Nirvan Samvat (2451) is considered correct, then based on this verse, the time of Umasvati is Vikram Samvat 300 or 300, and he is more than one hundred and fifty years behind the time of the lineage. If this time is considered correct, then Samantabhadra is a scholar close to Vikram Samvat 340 (AD 283) or 340. Veer Nirvan, Vikram and Saka Samvat.
However, no definite decision has been made about Veer Nirvan Samvat yet. Regarding this Samvat, which is considered to be prevalent 470 years (469 years 5 months) after Vikram Samvat, some scholars say that it is not correct; because from Veer Nirvan

470 years after the birth of King Vikrama - not the commencement of his Samvat - and for this, they present the following verse from the second Prakrit lineage of the Nandisingha:
A
Santari chasadatto tinakala vikamo havi jammo. Athavarasa balalila sodasavasehi bhammiye dese || 18 ||
According to their view, when Vikrama was 18 years old, 488 years and 5 months after the Nirvan of the Veer, the Vikrama Samvat commenced, and this is the Samvat of Vikrama's reign. Shriyut Babu Kashi Prasadji Jaiswal, Barrister-at-Law, Patna, and Master Bihari Lalji Buland - Shahari, support this view, and Dr. Herman Jacobi also seems to hold the same opinion*. In the lineage of the Nandisingha also
1 This lineage is also printed in the 4th Kiran of the Jain Siddhanta Bhaskar. 2 This verse is also found in the 'Vikram-Prabandh', (Jain Si. Bha., Kiran 4th, p. 75.)
*This is known from the following excerpt from a letter written by Dr. Herman Jacobi recently, while sending the book 'Bhagwan Mahavira', and this excerpt was printed by Shri Kamta Prasadji in the December 1924 issue of 'Veer'.
In the 32nd chapter you show that according to Digambara tradition, the Nirvâna of Mahavira took place 470 before Vikrama. Now I found in Gurvavali from Jaipur that Vikrama's birth occurred 470 years after Mahavira's Nirvana Sattari chadusadajutto tinakala vikkamo havi jammo. But the Vikrama era does not date from the janma of Vikrama, but from the rajya of Vikrama, or from the 18th year after his birth. By this reckoning the Nirvana should be placed 18 years earlier or 545 B. C.

The eras given for the enthronement of the Acharyas have been calculated from the time of Vikram's coronation;* otherwise, the time given in the said lineage for the establishment of Bhadrabahu II on the Acharya's seat as Vikrama Samvat 4 contradicts the second Prakrit lineage of the Nandisangha; because in that lineage, the mention of Bhadrabahu (II) being 492 years after the Vira Nirvana falls 22 years after the birth of Vikram. The fact that Samvat 22 is not given in the lineage but 4 is given clearly indicates that it is the era of Vikram's reign and began 18 years after his birth. Therefore; if it is correct to consider the prevalent Vikram Samvat not as the era of Vikram's birth but as the era of his reign, and it is also assumed that Vikram was born 470 years after the Vira Nirvana, then the current Vira Nirvana Samvat 2451 will have to be considered 2470; the time of Umasvati will then, based on the said verse, be fixed at Vikrama Samvat 281 or 281, and accordingly the time of Samantabhadra will also be 18 years earlier (around 265 or 265 AD).
There is another opinion regarding the Vikram Samvat, and it advocates the prevalent era as the era of Vikram's death. The main supporter of this opinion is our friend Pandit Nathuramji Premi. You, in the commentary of 'Darsansar', have mentioned your opinion in very clear words and have also tried to substantiate it with some evidence.

Swami Samantabhadra. *  In many verses of the Darsanasara, while giving directions about the time of the origin of some sanghas, the words 'Vikramaraayas maranapattaas' have been used. From this, Premiji got the idea that the chronology in this text is specifically based on the death of Vikram, or whether the prevalent Vikram Samvat is mentioned in it and it is the Samvat of Vikram's death. Upon searching, you found the following verse by Amitagati Acharya, and from it you got a basis for considering the prevalent Vikram Samvat as the death Samvat.
Samarudhe putratridashavasati vikramanripesahasre varshanam prabhavathi hi panchashadhike. Samaptam panchamyamavati dharini munjanripatou

He has given the time of the completion of his other book 'Dharmaparyiksha' in this way:
"In the year 1070 of the Vikram era, this refuted opinion has been completed, the Jainendra Dharma, with the help of logic."
In this verse, although, the completion of the book is mentioned in Vikram Samvat 1070 and it is not given any name like the year of ascension to heaven or the year of death; yet, reading this verse in the light of the first verse, there is no doubt in this matter that Acharya Amitagati has used the prevalent Vikram Samvat in his books and he considered it to be the year of Vikram's death. Mentioning the year of Vikram's death along with the Samvat or not mentioning it was the same thing, it made no difference. The mention of the reign of Munja in the first verse is even more supportive of this matter; because, it is found in history that Munja was enthroned in the prevalent Vikram Samvat 1050. And therefore, it cannot be said that Amitagati has mentioned a different Vikram Samvat in his aforementioned verses than the prevalent Vikram Samvat. Saying so would mean that the birth Samvat 1130 or the reign Samvat 1112 would have been prevalent at the time of death Samvat 1050 and there is no evidence in history of Munja being alive till that time. It is also found that Raja Bhoja, the successor of Munja, died before Vikram Samvat 1112.
Although, the idea of the people adopting the year of his death after Vikram's death seems a bit less, and it may be that Amitagati and others understood it as the year of death.

Although a mistake has been made, it is clear from the above mentions that this opinion of Premiji is not new - even a thousand years ago, there were people who held this opinion, and among them were Acharyas like Devasena and Amitagati. If this opinion is correct and it is also correct that Vikram was born physically 470 years after the Nirvan of the Tirthankara, then it must be accepted that the Vikram Samvat began approximately 550 (470 + 80) years after the Nirvan of the Tirthankara, and approximately 2531 (550 + 1981) years have passed since the Nirvan of the Tirthankara; because Vikram's age is said to be around 80 years. In this situation, the time of Umaswati comes out to be 220 or 220 according to the above verse, and then Samantabhadra also becomes a scholar of the third century of Vikram or the second and third centuries of the Christian era.

In this way, due to the three possibilities of the birth, reign, and death of Vikram Samvat, there are also three possibilities of the Nirvan Samvat, and based on that, there is also a difference in the time of the Acharyas whose time is determined based on it.

A scholar named George Charpentier, in the June, July, and August 1914 issues of the Indian 'Antiquary', wrote a detailed article.
* Acharya Devasena has also mentioned the death year of Vikram in his 'Bhavasangraha', and it is also found in the Bhavasangraha of Pandit Vamdeva as follows:

It has been argued that Mahavira's Nirvana did not occur 470 years before the Vikram Samvat, but rather 410 years before. Therefore, 60 years should be deducted from the prevailing Vira Nirvana Samvat. In your opinion, there is no historical evidence of a king named Vikram existing 470 years after Mahavira's Nirvana. Although Mr. K.P. Jayaswal has refuted your arguments, as evident from the fourth issue of the first volume of Jain Sahitya Sanshodhak, this topic remains controversial.

The issue of Vira Nirvana has been controversial not only in recent times, but also approximately 1500 years ago, or even earlier. This is evident from the mention of four different opinions on this subject in the Prakrit text "Tiloyapannatti" (Trilokprajnapti). For example:

* **Verse 86:** When 461 years had passed after Vira Jinendra attained Siddhipada, a king named Saka was born here.
* **Verse 87:** Or, when 1009 years had passed after Vira attained Siddhi, along with 57 months, a Saka was born.
* **Verse 88:** Or, when 14,000 years had passed after Vira attained Siddhi, along with 93 months, a Saka was born.
* **Verse 89:** Or, when 466 years and 5 months had passed after Vira Jinendra's Nirvana, a Saka was born.

* See Jain Hitaishi, Part 13, Issue 12, Page 533.

## Translation:

154
Swami Samantabhadra.

After the Bhagwan attained Siddhi, 9785 years and 5 months passed before the Saka era began. Or, the Saka era began 14793 years after the liberation of Viresvara. Or, the Saka era began 605 years and 5 months after the Nirvana of Virajinendra.

This statement clearly shows that at that time, there were four different opinions regarding the time of Vira Nirvana: the first opinion held that it was 461 years before the Saka era, the second held it was 9785 years and 5 months before, the third held it was 14793 years before, and the fourth held it was 605 years and 5 months before. Among these four opinions, the first one is new - different from the opinions mentioned earlier - and it seems to be the preferred opinion of the author of the Trilokaprajnapti. If this opinion is correct, then it should be said that the Vikram era began 326 (461 - 135) years after Vira Nirvana, not 470 years after, and currently, 2307 years of the Vira Nirvana Samvat have passed. Additionally, it should also be said that, based on the above verse, the time of Umasvati is around Vikrama Samvat 444 (770 - 326) or until 444, and the time of Samantabhadra also falls around the end of the 5th century of the Vikram era; or, in other words, he was so close to the time of Pujyapada that there is a high possibility that Pujyapada benefited from the association of Samantabhadra during his early monastic life.

The second and third opinions are not only completely new but also seem so extraordinary and unique that they cannot be imagined today. It is not known on what basis these two opinions are based and what their mystery is. Perhaps only a great scholar, after a very deep study of Jain scriptures, can unveil their mystery.

There is no doubt that the revelation of this secret can shed much light on the long and wide chronology of Jain scriptures. The fourth opinion, which is the one prevalent today, according to which the Vira Nirvana Samvat is considered to be 2451 at present. The following verse from Triloksar also mentions this opinion:
"Panchhasya vassan panamasajudan gamiy viranivvudo.
Sagarajo to kakki chadunavatiyamasagamasam." || 850 ||
Although, regarding this opinion, it cannot be said with certainty whether, according to it, the birth of the Saka king is considered to be 605 years and 5 months after Vira Nirvana, or the birth of the kingdom or the end of his reign is meant by it; yet it can be said for sure that if the reign of the Saka king began 605 years after Vira Nirvana, then the reign of King Vikram also began 470 years after Vira Nirvana - not 488 years later; because the difference of 135 years is well-known in the reigns or eras of both, which cannot be formed if the beginning of the Vikram reign is considered to be 488 years later. And therefore, what is written in the Prakrit Pattavali etc. that Vikram was born 470 years after Vira Nirvana, it may be his birth as a king - not as a body. Birth as a body can only be understood if the beginning of the Saka Samvat is also considered to be from the birth of the Saka king.
. 1 In this verse, it is stated that the Saka king was born 605 years and 5 months after Vira Nirvana and the Kalki was born 394 years and 7 months after Saka. 

Page #244:

## 156
Swami Samantabhadra.

One more point needs to be clarified here, and that is that in the aforementioned verse of Triloksar, the word 'to' is used after 'Sagrajyo', which is indicative of 'tatah' (thereafter). In the Sanskrit commentary by Madhavachandra Traividyadeva, its meaning is also "thereafter". And from this, it is clear that the Shak king's reign ended, or 394 years and 7 months after his death, Kalki became king. And since it is found in the Trilokprajnapti and other texts that Kalki's death occurs a thousand years after the Vira Nirvana, therefore, the aforementioned 394 years and 7 months also include Kalki's reign, which according to Trilokprajnapti is said to be 42 years. In other words, it should be said that the time given for Shak and Kalki in this verse indicates the end of their respective reigns. And therefore, it cannot be said that the Shak king's reign began 605 years and 5 months after the Vira Nirvana, and after its end, 394 years and 7 months passed before Kalki's reign began. Saying so would make Kalki's existence time not within a thousand years of the Vira Nirvana, but close to 1100 years, and that would hinder the fixed number of a thousand. Thus. If we accept that the Shak king's reign ended 605 years and 5 months after the Vira Nirvana, then it automatically has to be accepted that the Vikram king's reign also ended after 470 years of the Vira Nirvana, and therefore, 470 years after the Vira Nirvana.

The statement that Vikram Raja was born 157 years after the *Veer Nirvan* is not accurate, or it must be said that the 135-year difference between the two eras is not correct. In this situation, if we consider the Vikram Samvat not as the death anniversary of Vikram but as the year of his coronation when he was 18 or 20 years old, then, subtracting Vikram's reign (66-62 years) from 470, we have to say that it started approximately 408 years after the *Veer Nirvan*, or according to Jarl Chattier, 410 years after.  Simultaneously, we have to say that at this time, the *Veer Nirvan* Samvat was 2389 or 2391; and therefore, based on the aforementioned verse, the time of Umaswati should be Vikram Samvat 360 or 362, or one of these Samvats should be considered the final limit of their time, and accordingly, the time of Samantabhadra should also be indicated as close to Vikram Samvat 400 or 400.

From all this, the reader can understand for themselves how much confusion and uncertainty exists regarding the *Veer Nirvan* Samvat and its relationship with the Vikram and Saka Samvats, and therefore, based on it - without solving its mystery by taking one of its aspects - how reasonable and safe it can be to decide someone's time. There is no doubt that the uncertainty surrounding the *Veer Nirvan* era is a great shame and disgrace for the Jains, and therefore, scholars should resolve it completely as soon as possible. However, all this work, along with requiring more effort and time,

Kunda-Kunda-Samaya. (d) In the above 'g' section, the verse quoted from 'Vidvjanbodhak' which indicates the time of Umāsvāti, also mentions Kunda-Kunda-Acharya as a scholar of the same time, and thus both are indicated as contemporary scholars. However, according to this verse, even if both are considered contemporary, there is no doubt that Kunda-Kunda-Acharya was older. The lineage of the Nandisaṅgha mentions that Umāsvāti was established in the position of Acharya only after Kunda-Kunda, and from that it seems as if Umāsvāti was a disciple of Kunda-Kunda. However, the inscription at Śravaṇa-Belagola, while mentioning Umāsvāti immediately after Kunda-Kunda, does not indicate him as a disciple of Kunda-Kunda, but rather indicates him as a 'descendant' of Kunda-Kunda through the words 'tad-anvaye' and 'tadiya-vaṁśe'. However, this descent does not seem to be very distant. It is possible

It may be that Umasvati was not a disciple of Kundakunda but a student, and this may be the reason for the use of terms like 'Tadanvaye' etc. Even so, the two could have been contemporaries in many respects, and the end of Umasvati's time could also be considered the end of Kundakunda's time in a different way. Perhaps this is the reason why the above verse mentions Umasvati's time and then, through the words 'Kundakundastathaivacha', it is indicated that this is also the time of Kundakunda, i.e., Kundakunda also lived within this time. Thus, the above lineage gives Umasvati's age as 84 years and also indicates that he was established in the position of Acharya for 40 years and 8 months. If this mention is correct, it should be said that Umasvati was almost contemporary with Kundakunda for 43 years. In such a situation, if the definite time of Kundakunda is known, then from that too, a lot of real understanding of the near time of Samantabhadra can be obtained. But the time of Kundakunda has not yet been definitively established. The lineage of the Nandisangha, which gives your time from 94 to 101 AD, is not readily believable, considering the state of the lineage, and the time given in the above verse is subject to all the alternatives or doubts that have been presented in the 'G' part above; and therefore, on the basis of these two grounds, no particularity is achieved for the purpose of deciding the subject matter - the speculations made above regarding the time of Samantabhadra remain as they are. Now it should be seen whether any correct time of Kundakunda is available from any other path or not.

Swami Samantabhadra.
It is known from Indranandi Acharya's 'Shrutavatar' that after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira, within 62 years there were three Kevalis, then within 100 years there were five Shruta Kevalis, then within 183 years there were eleven Muni Dashapurva, then within 220 years there were five Ekadasangdhari, and then within 118 years there were four Acharaangdhari Muni. In this way, Anggyan remained for 683 years after Veer Nirvana. After this, four Araatiya Muni became Ang and Purva-ekadeshgyani, after them 'Arhadwal', after Arhadbalika 'Maghanandi' and after Maghanandi 'Dharasen' became Acharya, who were the knowers of 'Karmapraabhrut'. These Muni Raj, knowing their lifespan to be short and considering that the knowledge of Karmapraabhrut Shruta should not be lost after them, called two sharp-minded Munis from the Muni Sangha on the banks of the river Veena, who later became famous as 'Pushpadant' and 'Bhootbali' and taught them all the Shruta well. After that, Pushpadant and Bhootbali summarized Karmapraabhrut and gave it the form of Shatkhandagam and made it 'Dravyapustakaroot' - that is, it was written down. On the other hand, Gunadhar Acharya composed the Gathasutra of 'Kashaya Praabhrut', also known as 'Dosha Praabhrut', and taught them to the Munis named 'Nagahasti' and 'Aryamakshu', from them 'Yativrishabh' learned and composed the Churnisutra on those Gathas, and from Yativrishabh 'Uccaranacharya' studied and wrote the Vrittisutra on the Churnisutra. In this way, the composition of Kashaya Praabhrut was done by Gunadhar, Yativrishabh and Uccaranacharya and it also became 'Dravyapustakaroot'. When both Karmapraabhrut and Kashaya Praabhrut principles became 'Dravyabhav' in the form of books, in Kondakundapur, there was a Muni named Padmanandi (Kundakund)

The Acharya Guruparipati was knowledgeable in both principles and wrote a commentary on the first three sections of the 'Shatkhandagama', comprising twelve thousand verses.
This statement clearly indicates that Kundakunda Acharya did not exist before the Vira Nirvana 683, but after it. However, how much after is unclear. If we assume that the combined time of the four Araatiya Munis, Vinayadhar etc., who came after the last Acharaangdhari 'Lohaacharya', is 20 years, and the gross time of the gurus of Arhadvali, Maghanandi, Dharasen, Pushpadant, Bhootbali and Kundakunda is only 10-10 years, which is not an excessive assumption, then it can be easily said that Kundakunda existed 80 years after the said time or 763 (683+20+60) years after the Vira Nirvana, and this time is close to the time (770) given in the said verse quoted from the Vidvajnabodhak, and therefore it is greatly supported by it. In the Shrutavatar, the statement that only Kevali-Shrutakevalis etc. existed within 683 years from the Vira Nirvana to the last Acharaangdhari Lohaacharya, with the order and time-indication, is also found in ancient texts like Trilokprajnapti, Harivansh Purana by Jinsen and Adipurana by Bhagavajin. However, the Trilokprajnapti specifically includes the time of Ang and Purvokedeshdharis in the number 118 years of Acharaangdharis *; this includes the time of the four Araatiya Munis, Vinayadhar etc.

Swami Samantabhadra. The 20 years of the separate time period can be removed from the calculation and then it can be said that it happened 743 years after the Nirvāṇa of Kundakunda. Even this does not pose any obstacle to the support of the time of the above verse; because the verse primarily gives the time of Umāsvāti - even if he was a contemporary of Umāsvāti, due to old age, the existence of Kundakunda can be considered 27 years earlier and it is quite natural to assume that. The lineage of the Sena Gaṇa has also been calculated in the same way as the 'Śrutāvatāra' - 683 years. But in the 'Nandisangha's Prakrit lineage, that calculation is found to be somewhat different. In it, the time of the ten predecessors is given the same as mentioned above. After that, the time of the eleven-Anga holders, five monks, is given as 123 years instead of 220 years, and in the remaining 97 years, the existence of those four monks named Subhadra, Yaśobhadra, Bhadrabahu and Lohācārya is written and they are described as the readers of the ten, nine and eight Angas, which are described as eleven-Anga holders in the 'Śrutāvatāra' etc. texts.

In Jain Hitaishi, Part 6, Issue 7-8, Pandit Nathuramji has also mentioned the number seven after eight and written, "The text on the basis of which we have published this lineage, in it, they are described as readers of ten, nine, eight and seven Angas respectively." This seems to be the case, but in the lineage that we have, the readings are 'dasaṅga nava aṅga aṭṭhadhara' and 'dasanavaṭuṅgadhara'. It is possible that the first reading was printed incorrectly and it should be 'dasaṅga ṇava aṭṭhasatadhara'.

After the number of 220 years of 163 Ghadaris, it has been propounded within 118 years and also written as the knower of the first Anga named 'Acharang'. After these four Munis, five Acharyas named Arhadvali, Maghanandi, Gharasen, Pushpadant and Bhootbali have been written as 'Ekangdhari' and their time is given as 118 years*. In this way, 683 years have been calculated from Veer Nirvana to Bhootbali. This calculation is how different from Shrutavatar, Trilokprajnapti, Harivansh Purana, Adipurana and Senagan's lineage and how much difference does it make in the time calculation of Acharyas from Pushpadant to Bhootbali, the reader can understand himself. But if this is considered correct and it is accepted that Bhootbali's existence was till Veer Nirvana Samvat 683, then at least 20-30 years will have to be imagined for the advent of Kundkund after Bhootbali; because Kundkund had knowledge of both the principles through the Guru tradition and Pushpadant, Bhootbali or Uccarana

Swami Samantabhadra. Acharya, no one has written you as their guru; therefore, it seems necessary to have at least one Acharya as your guru after these Acharyas, for which the said time is not much. In this way, the beginning of Kundakunda's time becomes around 703 or 713 from the Veer Nirvana. But if this assumption of more time is also abandoned and it is assumed that Kundakunda Acharya happened only 683 years after Veer Nirvana, then it must be said that he happened after Vikram Samvat 213 (683-470), not before. This is the opinion of most Jain scholars, including Pandit Nathuramji Premi*. We would like to add to this that, assuming Vikram's birth to be 470 years after Veer Nirvana, if his Vikram Samvat is the Rajya Samvat, then Kundakunda Acharya happened 195 (683-488) years later, and if it is the Mrityu Samvat, then he happened 133 (683-550) years later. Also, it is further known that the existence time of Yade Shaka Raja was up to 461 years from Veer Nirvana, the current Shaka Samvat (1846) is prevalent from his death, and there is a real difference of 135 years between Vikram and Shaka Samvats, then Kundakunda Acharya happened 357 (683-361+135) years after Vikram Samvat.
The assumption of the time of Samantabhadra from the time of Umaswati is generally made 40 years later, from the time of Kundakunda it can be made 60 years later and does not seem unreasonable. In such a situation, Samantabhadra can be called a scholar around Vikram Samvat 273, 255, 193 or 417. And if Shaka Samvat is the

If the death year is not the year of his reign or birth, then the years of the Saka era or his age can be reduced from the previous 417 years.
King Shiv Kumar |
In the commentary of the 'Panchaastikaya' sutra written by Jayasenacharya, it is written that Shri Kundakundaacharya composed this scripture for the understanding of his disciple Shiv Kumar Maharaj, and he is the reason for the creation of this scripture.
As
".... Shrimat Kundakundaacharya Devaih Shiv Kumar Maharajadisanksheparuchi Shishya pratibodhanartham Virachite Panchaastikaya praabhrut shaastre ........”
..
"Atha praabhrut grantha Shiv Kumar Maharajo nimitta anyatra dravyasangrahaadou somashreshthayaadi jnatavyam. Iti sanskhepene nimitta kathitham. "
In the Kannada commentary of the scripture, which was made by 'Balachandra' Muni, a similar mention is found. Professor K.B. Pathak has equated this Shiv Kumar Maharaj with the Kadamba dynasty king 'Shiv Mrigesha Varma' - he is the same Shiv Kumar - and by determining the time of Shiv Mrigesha, 50 years before the destruction of the ancient Kadamba dynasty by the Chalukya emperor 'Kirtivarma' Maharaj in Vadami in Saka Samvat 500,
it has been established that Kundakundaacharya was in Saka Samvat

Swami Samantabhadra, in the introduction of 'Samayasara Prabhut', has cited this opinion to strengthen his argument that the time of Kundakunda's birth cannot be before 213 CE. He also argues that there is no harm in accepting this. However, we see only harm in accepting it - no benefit at all, and it does not seem reasonable at all. Accepting this opinion would mean that Samantabhadra, as well as Pujyapada, were scholars before Kundakunda. Then, the statements that Umasvati came in the lineage of Kundakunda, that Umasvati composed the Tattvarth Sutra, that Pujyapada wrote a commentary called 'Sarvarth Siddhi' on the Tattvarth Sutra, etc., would have no meaning or value. And the definite mention found in dozens of inscriptions and texts about Pujyapada and many other scholars who came before him, stating that they were in the lineage of Kundakunda or came after him, would become false and meaningless. 

* 'The time of Bhagavan Kundakunda's birth cannot be established before the 213th Vikram Samvat.'............
'Therefore, even by reasoning, the time of Bhagavan Kundakunda is established as the 450th Saka Samvat, because he was contemporary with Shiva Mrigesha Varma. And there is no harm in accepting this.'
For example, see the copper plate inscription of Merkara, which was written in the 388th Saka Samvat, and in which the lineage of Acharyas in the lineage of Kundakunda Acharya is mentioned as follows:
'.......Sriman Kongani-Mahaadhiraj Avinita-namadheyadatta's Desiggana, Kaundakunda-anvaya-guna-chandra-bhatar-shishya's Abhayanandi-bhatar, his shishya's Shilabhadra-bhatar-shishya's Janaanndi-bhatar-shishya's Gunanandi-bhatar-shishya's Vandamandi-bhatar-garge, eighty-three hundred years, Magha month......"

What is all this less harm? It is not understood why the jurist has written this without considering the previous and subsequent relationships. However, in our opinion, firstly, Jayasenadica's writing that 'this Panchastikaya was composed for the address of Shivakumar Maharaj or for his sake' seems very modern, there is no mention of it in the original text, nor is there any support for it from the ancient commentary by Shri Amritchandracharya. Kundakunda himself has stated at the end of the text that he composed this 'Panchastikaya Sangrah' Sutra for the sake of Morga, inspired by preaching devotion. As
- * Around the 13th and 14th centuries; because Balachandra Muni was a scholar of the 13th century Vikram. His guru Nayakirtika died in Shaka Samvat 1099 (Vikram Samvat 1234). And Jayasenacharya seems to be a scholar of the 14th century Vikram. The 'Kumudeendu' whom he has saluted in the praise of Pravachansaratika was a contemporary scholar of the said Balachandra Muni. In your Pribhritratraya commentaries, there are many mentions of texts like Gommatasar, Charitrasar, Dravyasangrah etc. made in the 11th and 12th centuries. In such a situation, the time given as 'Vikram Samvat 1369 Varshvahin Shukla 1 Bhoum Dine' after 'Panchastikaya: Samapt:' at the end of the Panchastikaya commentary is not surprising, which is the time of the completion of the commentary.
1 Prof. A. Chakravarti writes in the preface of 'Panchastikaya' that all the commentators of Pribhritratraya have mentioned that Kundakunda composed these three texts for the benefit of his disciple Shivakumar; but we have not seen any such mention in any commentary of Amritchandracharya. It is not known on what basis Prof. Sahib has made this statement. . 2 'Margo hi paramavairagyakaranapravanaparameshwari paramaajna.' (Amritchandra). .

This clearly shows that Kundakunda did not write this text for any particular person or at their behest, but its specific purpose is 'margaprabhavna' and the cause is 'pravacanabhakti'. If Kundakunda had written this text for Shivakumar Maharaj or at his behest, he would have mentioned it in this verse or elsewhere, just as Yogindradev mentioned it in the 'Paramatmaprakash' written for Bhatta Prabhakar. But there is nothing like this in the original text, nor is it mentioned in the ancient commentary, nor is there any mention of Shivakumar in any other text of Kundakunda. Therefore, the mind is not ready to accept that this was written for Shivakumar Maharaj. It is possible that a scholar mentioned it based on some legend and then others copied it. Besides this, the way Jayasenacharya mentioned 'Shivakumar' in the commentary of 'Pravacanasara' in the first introductory sentence, makes the situation of Shivakumar Maharaj even more doubtful.

He, being completely impartial, having abandoned all attachment to enemies, friends, and other parties, and accepting as worthy of attainment the liberation, which is the essence of dharma, artha, and kama, which is completely beneficial to the self, which is imperishable, and which has arisen from the grace of the five supreme beings, bows down to the five supreme beings, headed by the supreme god, Sri Vardhamana Swami Tirthankara, with offerings and obeisance, and vows to take refuge in the supreme conduct.
After this introduction, there are five verses from the original text, dealing with auspiciousness and other topics, of which the last two verses are as follows:
I bow down to the Arhats, the Siddhas, and also to the Ganadharas. I bow down to all the Ajjhavayavaggans and the Sahus. ||4||
I attain the same state of purity as their pure vision and knowledge. I attain the state of liberation by attaining the right faith and right knowledge. ||5||
In these verses, Sri Kundakunda Acharya has stated that 'I bow down to the Arhat, Siddha, Acharya, Upadhyaya, and Sarvasadhu (the five supreme beings) and by attaining their pure vision and knowledge, I take refuge in, or attain, that state of equality (supreme conduct free from attachment) which leads to liberation.' And by this vow, he has indicated the subject matter of his text. Now, look at the introduction of the commentator, in which this vow is made by Shiv Kumar, and in this way, Shiv Kumar is indicated as the author of the original text, or, in another way, as a synonym for Kundakunda. Also, the epithets given to Shiv Kumar cannot be the epithets of a king - they are the epithets of a great sage who is free from even attachment to conduct.

Being inclined towards the character of a Vitaraga. In such a situation, the reader can understand for themselves how dubious the situation of Shivakumar Maharaj is. - Secondly, there is no logical reason for the equation that has been made between Shivakumar and 'Shivmrigeshavarma'. A better equation seems to be that of Professor A. Chakravarti Nayanar, M.A., L.T., which has been made with the ancient Pallava king of Kanchi, 'Shivaskandavarman'*; because 'Skanda' is a synonym for Kumar and in a donation letter he is also written as 'Yuvamaharaj' which is a synonym for 'Kumar Maharaj'; therefore, from the point of view of meaning, Shivakumar and Shivaskanda both seem to be one. Apart from this, the donation letter of Shivaskanda, 'Mayidabolu', except for the final Mangal pady, is written in Prakrit language and from it, the Prakrit language of Shivaskanda's court is found, which seems more suitable for establishing a connection between Shivaskanda and the creation of this text. Also, the time of Shivaskanda is estimated to be many centuries before Shivmrigesha. Therefore, the said equation of the reader
_ * See 'Historical Introduction' written by Prof. A. Chakravarti in the English edition of 'Panchastikaya', 1920.
+ Mr. Chakravarti, starting from many years before the time of Kundakunda's existence, has considered him to be a scholar of the first half of the first century AD, and therefore, according to him, the time of Shivaskanda should be the first century AD; but in one place he has also given these words

It seems that it is not right in any way. Taking this equation into account, the Toranaacharya mentioned in the two copper plates, due to being Kundakundanvayi, has been considered a scholar only one hundred and fifty years back; otherwise, there was no other basis for such an imagination. We see such mentions of many scholars in which they have been informed as Kundakundanvayi and they have been scholars from a thousand years before Kundakunda. For example, take the Pavali of Shubhachandracharya, in which the guru of Sakalakirti Bhattarak, 'Padmanandi', has been written as 'Tadanvaya Dharan Dhuri' after Kundakundaacharya and who was a scholar of about the 15th century AD. Therefore, it does not seem reasonable to consider Toranaacharya as a scholar of Shaka Samvat 600 and Kundakunda as a scholar 150 years before him - Shaka Samvat 450 - on the basis of the said copper plates and it seems to be based on the false imagination of the said equation. Before 450, there is a written Shaka Samvat 388
Same name was the contemporary and deciple of Sri. Kundakunda.
These words suggest that Chakravarti Maharaj may have found it doubtful that this Shivaskanda was in the first half of the first century AD, he also considers it possible that he was later, and therefore he has also given place to the imagination of another ancestor of the same name before this Shivaskanda for the contemporaneity and discipleship of Kundakunda.

Elâchârya. Professor A. Chakravarti, in his 'Historical Introduction' to the Panchastīkāya, based on the lists of the Nandisaṅgha edited by Professor H. Kern, has considered Kundakunda to be a scholar of the first century of the Vikram era - he has stated that he was installed as an Acharya in 49 Vikram Samvat (8 years before the Christian era), he received the Acharya position at the age of 44, he remained in that position for 51 years and 10 months, and his total lifespan is said to be 95 years, 10 months, and 15 days. At the same time, while revealing that Kundakunda also had the name 'Elâchârya', and regarding the Tamil language work 'Kural', it is said that 'Elâchârya' composed it and gave it to his disciple Thiruvalluvar, who is famous for it as his work, and who presented it before the Madurasangha (the assembly of poets of Madurai), he has tried to prove that the said Elâchârya and Kundakunda were the same person, and therefore the time of 'Kural' is also the first century of the Christian era*. But whether the time of 'Kural' is the first century of the Christian era or something else, and whether it was composed by Elâchârya or not, we do not need to go into this discussion, because based on it, Kundakunda's

The time decision has not been made. We only need to see here that the time propounded by Chakravarti Mahashray Kundakunda, how far it appears reasonable. As for the fact that 'Elacharya' was an alternative name of Kundakunda or not, we only want to say that as far as we have understood Jain literature, we do not know from any other text or inscription except the lineage of the Nandisangha or the Guru lineage that 'Elacharya' was an alternative name of Kundakunda. From many inscriptions etc., his other name 'Padmanandi' is available and that was his initiation time name or first name *; he became famous later as 'Kaundakundacharya', the melodious form of which became 'Kundakundacharya' and this was his country-suffix name because he was from Kondakundapur and therefore Kondakundacharya means 'Acharya of Kondakundapur'. At that time, there was a practice of such names, there were groups of monks established in many cities and villages, and the very great Acharyas among them were sometimes known by the name of that city etc. Shravan

Many such names are found mentioned in the inscriptions of Belgol, etc. The two names 'Grdhrapiccha' and 'Vakragriva' which are given in the lineage, are not found anywhere else. They were different scholars - 'Grdhrapiccha' was another name of Umasvati, which is found mentioned in many inscriptions and texts, and 'Vakriva' was a different Acharya, whose mention is also found in the 54th inscription of Shravanabelgol, etc. Similarly, there were other scholars named 'Elacharaya', from whom Bhagavjjinasena's guru Shrivirsenacharya had studied the principles of the scriptures and wrote commentaries on them called 'Dhavla' and 'Jayadhavla', which are also called Dhavla and Jayavala Siddhanta. The 'Dhavla' commentary was completed by Virsen in Shaka Samvat 738; from this, 'Elacharaya' was a scholar of the 9th century Vikram.
According to Chakravarti, Dr. G.U. Pope has stated the time of 'Kural' to be somewhat behind the 8th century AD, and that time coincides with the time of these Elacharayas. It is not surprising, if

this is the time of 'Kural', then these Elacharayas may have contributed to its composition.

Special assistance may have been provided. But the idea of giving it to him completely composed does not seem right; because if Thiruvalluvar was so incompetent that he could not compose such a work himself, then he would not have been worthy of presenting it in his own name before the assembly of poets—he would then—present the 'Kural' in the name of the Elaacharya, in whose name there seems to be no obstacle in presenting it, and if he himself was capable of composing such a work, then it is not possible that he had the entire work written by another scholar and revealed it in his own name or that he did not put his own pen in it at all. In this matter, the Hindu tradition that Thiruvalluvar composed this work himself with the help of 'Elalasingh' seems more weighty; but it is not quite right to call the author a Shaiva follower. It is very possible that the Hindu 'Elalasingh' is the same as Elaacharya or that this is some name of Elaacharya's householder life. In such a situation, without the availability of any strong evidence or proper support, one cannot readily believe in the natural statement of the lineage. And it cannot be said on the basis of that alone that Elaacharya was a name change of Kundakunda.
.. Time as stated in the lineage. Now take the time consideration. The lineage on the basis of which Chakravarti Maharaj has stated the said time of Kundakunda is the same lineage which has been shown to be very doubtful and unreliable in part 'B' above.

Swami Samantabhadra: It is not possible to firmly establish the time of an Acharya based solely on accusations unless they are thoroughly refuted. However, there is a possibility that many of the times mentioned in them are true. Therefore, we should see if there is any obstacle, in any way, to the truth of the time mentioned by Kundakunda. It is accepted and there is no disagreement that Angajnan existed for 683 years after the Vira Nirvana. After that, there was no Angajnani - not even a single reader of the Angas. And Kundakunda Acharya was not an Angajnani. According to the statement of Indranandi Shrutavatar, Kundakunda came after many generations of the last Acharaanga-dhari, Lohaacharya. It is not unreasonable to assume a time of 60-80 years for these generations. And according to the Prakrit Pattavali, if we consider Bhootbali as the last Ekanga-dhari, then the time of Kundakunda would be only 20-30 years after 683. But, summarizing both perspectives, if we assume that Kundakunda came immediately after the last Ekanga-dhari (Lohaacharya or Bhootbali), then we have to accept that he came 683 years after the Vira Nirvana. And in such a situation, as explained above, Kundakunda cannot be proven to be a scholar of the first century Vikram. However, if we assume that Kundakunda, despite not being an Anga-dhari, came before the Ekanga-dharis, then his time could be the first century Vikram. It seems that Mahamaheshvara Chakravarti also believes the same, which is revealed as follows:

You have calculated 468 years up to the Ekadasanga-dharis. In this calculation, the combined time of the Ekadasanga-dharis has been considered as 133 years instead of 220, and that is according to the Prakrit Pattavali. Taking this same Pattavali, you have stated the time of Subhadra and Yashobhadra after the last Ekadasanga-dhari, Kansa, as 6 years and 18 years respectively. After this, by matching the 23 years of time of Bhadrabahu II with the second Pattavali of the Nandisangha, you have taken recourse to that Pattavali for the time of Kundakunda; and since the Pattavali mentions the time of Bhadrabahu's establishment on the Acharya seat as Vikramrajya Samvat 4, it has been established that Vikram was born in the second year from the beginning of the said time of Subhadra - or by this mention it has been indicated that Vikram was crowned on the throne at the age of about 18 years and at that time the 15th year of Yashobhadra's time was passing. Also, from the time you have given for the Acharyas who came before Kundakunda, based on this previous Pattavali, it appears that after Yashobhadra, Bhadrabahu II, Guptigupta, Maghanandi I and Jinachandra, these four Acharyas came within 45 years 8 months 9 days; and since the establishment of Bhadrabahu II on the Acharya seat is written on Chaitra Sudi 14, it also appears that he was established on the Acharya seat 492 (468+6+18) years 5 months 13 days after the Veer Nirvana. In this way, from the Veer Nirvana, 538 years 1 month 22 days (492 years 5 months
1 Veer Nirvana took place on Kartik Vadi 15, after that, there is time of 5 months 13 days before Chaitramudi 14.

(13 days + 45 years 8 months 9 days) after, on the 8th day of Paushvadi, the ordination of Kundakunda to the Acharya position is established; or in other words, according to the Prakrit Pattavali, when the time of Lohaacharya, the reader of 7-8 Angas, was ongoing, or according to the Shrutavat-tar and Trilokprajnapti, etc., when the time of Kansaacharya, possibly of the Ekadasangadharis, was passing, the existence of Kundakundaacharya is established.

Although, even without being an Angajnani, it cannot be said that Kundakunda's existence during the time of Angajnanis is impossible or unnatural; - there must have been other scholars at that time who were not readers of even a single Anga, but accepting this leads to the following objections, which cannot be refuted or resolved without a proper understanding of Kundakunda's time, which is based on a very questionable and objectionable Pattavali.

(1) Based on both Pattavalis, Arhadbali is almost contemporary with Kundakunda, and the remaining four Acharyas, Maghanandi (II), Dharasen, Pushpadanta, and Bhootbali, are found to be scholars immediately after Kundakunda, and this contradicts the Indranandi Shrutavatar.

(2) Gunadhar, Nagahastin, Aryamanksu, Yativrishabha, and Uccaranaacharya are also found to be scholars many years after Kundakunda, and this also contradicts the 'Shrutavatar'.

1. The time of Lohaacharya begins 515 years after the Veernirvana, and he is said to have lived for 50 years. Therefore, after Kundakunda became an Acharya, the time of Lohaacharya continued for another 27 years.

(3) There is no clear mention in any text or inscription that indicates that Maghanandi, Dharasen, Pushpadanta, Bhootbali, and Gunadhar, Nagahastin, Aryamakshu, Yativrishabha, and Uccaranaacharya, all or any of them, were in the lineage of Kundakunda or came after him. There are many lists of Acharyas who came after Kundakunda, but none of them mention these Acharyas, which makes it difficult to believe that they came after Kundakunda. However, in one place, in the inscription number 105 (254) of Shravanabelagola, these sentences are found:
"Pushpadanta and Bhootbali, both were disciples of Alik, and from them, Arhadbali ruled, as if two new shoots have been taken by the Kalpavriksha to give fruits to the people of the world. These Arhadbali, due to the nature of time, divided the original Sangha, which is the Kundakundanvaya, into four parts, and those divisions are four Sangha named Sen, Nandi, Dev, and Singh. Whoever considers the real difference in these four Sangha is a Kudrusti."

Swami Samantabhadra.
In this statement, the epithet 'Kunda-kundanvaya' is given to the original sangha, and the division of the same Kunda-kundanvaya-characterized original sangha into four sanghas by Arhadvali is written. From this, although it sounds like Kunda-kundanvaya was established before Arhadvali, and therefore Kunda-kunda was before Arhadvali, this inscription is written in Saka Samvat 1320, when Kunda-kundanvaya was very famous and the munis, etc., were proud to call themselves Kunda-kundanvaya. Therefore, it is also possible that this epithet was used to show the present Kunda-kundanvaya as inseparable from the original sangha, and it has no historical connection. Arhadvali, as has been shown above, was a contemporary of Kunda-kunda according to the pattavalis - he lived only about three years after Kunda-kunda*. In such a situation, the possibility of him dividing Kunda-kundanvaya in this way is less likely. Besides this, the following inscription from Shravanabelagola opposes the idea of this fourfold sangha by Arhadvali -
"Then, among the learned munis, Kalank Suri became the best. All the meanings were obscured by false darkness, which were illuminated by his rays of words."
* In the Prakrit pattavali, the time of Arhadvali is given from 565 years after Vira-nivan to 593, and it is known from the second pattavali of the Nandi-sangha that Kunda-kunda was established in the Acharya position for 51 years, 10 months, and 10 days, which makes his lifespan up to Vira-ni. Samvat 590, and thus Arhadvali lived for a total of three years after Kunda-kunda.

In that time, the great sage, having attained heaven, danced as it were, with the best of the celestial beings. From that lineage, there arose four types of divisions in the Sangha of the Muni-ishwaras, due to differences in the land.  The Lord Jinendra, being wise in the Sangha, seeing these four types of divisions, which were not contradictory to each other, became like four faces, all the same.  The Deva-Nandi-Singha-Sena - Sangha divisions, due to differences in the land, became enlightened by the Deva-Yogis.  From the point of view of conduct, all of them were not contradictory to the Dharma, and thus, the Nandi-Sangha became famous in the middle. - Inscription No. 108 (258).

These verses indicate that after the attainment of heaven by Akalankadeva (the author of Rajavartika and other works), four types of divisions arose in the Sangha of his lineage, due to differences in the land, and which were not contradictory to each other in their practice of Dharma.  No mention of these four types of Sangha has been found in the literature before Akalanka, which makes the truth of this statement highly probable.

181
(4) The statement that Kundakunda wrote a commentary of 12,000 verses on the first three sections of the 'Shatkhandagama' is also false.
(5) The available Jain literature suggests that the works of Kundakunda are the most ancient, which contradicts the general belief that the works called 'Karma-Prabhrita' and 'Kashaya-Prabhrita', on which commentaries like Dhavala are available, are the most ancient.

(6) It would also be necessary to consider as false the time period given for Kundakunda in the verse that explains to the learned, which is supported by texts like 'Shrutavatar' etc. as mentioned above; because a difference of about 200 years is found between this time and that time.
(7) Besides this, it will also be necessary to clarify the position of the Jina Acharyas named 'Guptigupt' and 'Jinachandra' mentioned in the lineage before Kundakunda; because Shruta Sagar Suri, while explaining the meaning of 'Sisenaya Bhadrabahu' in the commentary of Bodhapahuḍ, has stated 'Guptigupt' as the alternative name of 'Vishakhacharaya', the tenth predecessor - "Bhadrabahushiṣyeṇa Arhadali-Guptiguptapranamadvayena Vishakhacharayanamna Dashapurvadharinam Ekadashaanamaacharyana Madhye Prathamena......" and Dr. Fleet has equated it with Chandragupta (Maurya) * . From both these mentions, 'Guptigupt' is established as the disciple of Bhadrabahu Shrutakevali, but in the lineage, he is shown as the disciple or successor of Bhadrabahu II. And no mention of the name 'Guptigupt' is found in the inscriptions. Similarly, the position of 'Jinachandra' is also doubtful. It is not proven by any strong evidence that Jinachandra was the Guru of Kundakunda; in the inscriptions, not only the name of Jinachandra as the Guru of Kundakunda, but also the name of any other Acharya is not found. Yes, it is definitely found in some inscriptions that Kundakunda was the

The disciple 'Chandragupta' has been in the lineage. Apart from this, Jayasenacharya, in the commentary on Panchastikaya, where the composition of the original text for Shiv Kumar Maharaj is stated, has also written that Kundkund is the disciple of 'Kumoranandisiddhantadeva'; this made it even more necessary to clarify the position of Jinachandra, which Chakravarti Mahashaya did not do.
In such a situation, the time proposed by Chakravarti Mahashaya for Kundkund does not seem safe, certain and readily acceptable, and therefore, the time of Samantabhadra cannot be determined on its basis. If somehow this time (1st century Vikram) of Kundkund is proved to be correct, then the time of Samantabhadra can be considered 50-60 years behind it.

Here it seems appropriate to reveal further that at the end of 'Bodhapraabhrut' a verse is found as follows
x For example, see the part of the 40th Shi. inscription of Shravanabelagola which has been quoted in the 'Pitrikul and Gurukul' section, or the following part of the 108th Shi. inscription

"Swami Samantabhadra. What the Jina said in the *Bhasasutra*, the same has been said by me, the disciple of Bhadrabahu. ||61.. This verse states that the words spoken by the Jina, Lord Mahavira, in the form of meaning, have been received in the *Bhasasutra* - they have been expressed in many different words - I, the disciple of Bhadrabahu, have known this from the *Bhasasutra* and have stated it (in this text).

From this statement, it is clear that 'Bhadrabahu's disciple' does not refer to someone other than the author of this text, and therefore, Kundakunda appears to be the disciple of Bhadrabahu. By this verse - if it is indeed a verse of this text - he has clarified the basis of his statement and declared its special authenticity. Otherwise, the mention of a disciple of Bhadrabahu, other than Kundakunda, knowing and stating something does not make sense here. The commentator Shruta Sagar also could not clarify this connection; the idea of 'Vishakacharya' that he has conceived for 'Bhadrabahu's disciple' also does not seem reasonable. It seems that the commentator, considering Bhadrabahu to be a Shruta Kevali, has simply mentioned one of his main disciples and has not paid much attention to the connection of the statement with the subject matter, which is why the connection of the verse is not clear while reading it. Now we should see who this Bhadrabahu could be, whose disciple Kundakunda has declared himself to be. He does not appear to be a Shruta Kevali; because if Bhadrabahu is considered to be a disciple of a Shruta Kevali, then Kundakunda would be approximately 300 years before Vikram."

## Time-Determination

It is stated by learned scholars that Kundakunda was established as an Acharya around 185 [Vikram Samvat]. At that time, the presence of great scholars like the Dashapurvadharis, Muni Rajas, does not seem to be a matter of doubt. Therefore, Kundakunda must have been a disciple of the same Bhadrabaahu II who is mentioned as the third scholar among the holders of the first Anga, "Acharanga," by ancient writers. And in the lineage, after him, the names of Guptigupta, Maghanandi, and Jinachandra are imagined. But the time of his establishment as an Acharya, given as 4 [Vikram Samvat] in the lineage, does not seem reasonable. It appears to be established based on a calculation that considers the time of the Ekadashaanga holders as 123 years instead of 220 years, which is not supported by any ancient text. At that time, there was no such system of lineages as found in later lineages or Guruavalis, written with the aim of recording the succession. Nor was there any rule that the Acharya's position was inherited by the disciple, whether he was worthy or not, upon the Acharya's death. Rather, the situation at that time suggests that an Acharya was given the position only when he was worthy of it. And in this way, during the time of one Acharya, many of his disciples also became Acharyas and ruled separate Muni Sanghas. Or, some Acharyas would relinquish the Acharya position during their lifetime and entrust the rule of the Sangh to a worthy disciple, while they themselves would take on the position of Upadhyaya or Sadhu Paramesthi. Therefore, regarding very ancient Acharyas, the time of their establishment as Acharya given in the lineages

And one cannot believe in the order suddenly. In the available Jain literature, the time of the Ekadasangadharis is found to be 565 years after the Nirvan of the Veer, based on the oldest texts mentioning the subject matter. After this, in 118 years, there were four Ekangadharis and some Angapurvas who were also Eka-deshadharis. And among these, the name of Bhadrabahu II is at number three. The total number of years for these four Acharyas, which is given separately in the Prakrit Pattavali as 6, 18, 23, and 50 years, is 97 years. It is possible that this number of years for the duration of these Munis is correct, and the remaining 21 (118-97) years may have been the time of the Eka-deshadharis of the Angapurvas. According to this calculation, the time of Bhadrabahu (II) seems to have started 589 (565+6+18) years after the Nirvan of the Veer and lasted till the 612th year. Now, if it is assumed - which does not seem to be a major obstacle - that Kundakunda became his disciple about five years before the end of Bhadrabahu's time - after 607 years from the Nirvan of the Veer - and also, if the statement found in the Pattavali that 'Kundakunda' became a Muni at the age of 11, remained a simple Muni for 33 years, and then remained established in the position of Acharya for 51 years 10 months 10 days, is also accepted as mostly true, then the time of Kundakunda becomes around 608 to 692 years after the Nirvan of the Veer. Within this time - till 662 years after the Nirvan of the Veer - the time of the last Acharangadhari 'Lohacharaya' also passes, and after that, the time of the Angapurva Eka-deshadharis or the Angapurva Padaansh Vedis for 21 years also passes, in which Arha...

The time of Dvali, Maghanandi and Dharasena etc. can also be included; because no specific names of Anga-Purva-Ekadeshadharis are given in Trilokaprajnapti, their time is calculated in the Prakrit Pattavali in the time of Ekangadharis (from 566 to 683) - or you can say that they are called Ekangadharis - in the 'Gurvavali' of Nandisangh, Maghanandi is written as 'Purvapadanshavedi' * and in 'Shrutavatar', Acharya Arhadvali, Maghanandi and Dharasen are mentioned as Ekadeshjnata of Anga-Purvi. Apart from this, from the stone inscription no. 105 of Shravanabelagola, whose verses have been quoted above, it is known that Pushpadanta and Bhootbali were the disciples of Arhadvali. Dharasen had called these Pushpadanta and Bhootbali when he saw his death approaching and imparted the knowledge of Karmapraabhrut Shastra. From this, Arhadvali, Maghanandi, Dharasen, Pushpadanta and Bhootbal, all seem to be scholars of almost the same time. It is another matter that some of them may have lived a few years behind each other, and this often happens among contemporary scholars. The rest, by the words 'tatah', 'tadanantar' etc., which place them somewhere else

Respected scholars have indicated that the meaning should not be understood from the death of one and the birth of another, but from the time of their attainment of the Acharya position, attainment of knowledge, etc., or from the perspective of greatness and smallness. Or, it can also be called a style of the authors to narrate in sequence. Thus, it is possible that Kundakunda wrote the commentary on the 'Shatkhandagama' principle after becoming established at that time * and leaving aside the aforementioned point of Pattachali, light can be shed on many other things.  _ Considering the birth of Vikram 470 years after the Veer Nirvan and accepting that the Vikram Samvat was prevalent 18 years after the birth of the Rajya Samvat, the entire Muni life of Kundakunda comes to be from 120 to 204 in the Vikram Samvat. And if the prevalent Vikram Samvat is the death Samvat or the birth Samvat, then this period can also be said to be from 60 to 144 or from 138 to 222 respectively, by reducing it by 60 years or increasing it by 18 years. In this long Muni life of Kundakunda, which includes about 52 years of his Acharya period, it is not unnatural for two or three generations of Kundakunda to have passed - to have existed in his time. It is not surprising if Samantabhadra's Muni life began only in his old age and thus there is a difference of about 60 years between the two. In such a situation, Samantabhadra could be in the second or third generation of Vikram, or the second, or  _ * If Kundakunda did not actually write any commentary on the 'Shatkhandagama', then his initiation period can be considered 10-15 years earlier; and then his previous time will have to be reduced by 10-15 years.

He is considered a scholar of the third century, and this time is almost in line with the time of the list mentioned in Dr. Bhandarkar's report, in which Samantabhadra is described as a scholar close to Saka Samvat 60 (Vikram Samvat 195), and which has been accepted as evidence by scholars like Lewis Rice, etc.
If, in any way, the calculation of the Prakrit list is correct compared to the calculation of other ancient texts, and according to it, Bhadrabahu II is considered to have been established in the position of Acharya in Vikram Samvat 4; along with this, it is assumed that Kundakunda had taken initiation from him in Vikram Samvat 17, then this makes the period of Kundakunda's monkhood from Vikram Samvat 17 to 101, and this is the same time that is given in the second list of Nandisangha, and which has been considered above in relation to the statement of Chakravarti Maharaj. Accepting this time, Samantabhadra is indeed a scholar of the second century of Vikram, but there is still a need to resolve all the objections that have been raised above, or it has to be accepted that Kundakunda Acharya came before the Acharyas like Arhadvali, Maghanandi, Dharasen, Pushpadanta, Bhootbali and Gunadhar, and he did not write any 'tika' on the 'Shatkhandagam' of Pushpadanta-Bhootbali.

Refers to a scholar named 'Tumbuluracharya' in form, who was a resident of the village 'Tumbullur' and was called 'Tumbulluracharya' from this. Along with this, it has been told that he wrote that commentary in Kannada language, it is 84 thousand verses in quantity and its name is 'Chudamani'. The real name of Tumbuluracharya is said to be 'Srivardhadeva' - scholars like Lewis Rice, Edward Rice and S.G. Narasimhacharya etc. have made the same statement in their respective books - but what is the basis of telling this, it is not clear. In Rajavali Kathe, this commentary is mentioned by the name 'Chudamani Vyakhyan', it is written as the work of Tumbuluracharya and the number of books is also given as 84 thousand; in Karnataka Shabdanusasan, 'Chudamani' is called a great book of Kannada language, it is indicated as the commentary of Tattvarthamaha Shastra, the number of books is given as 96 thousand but the name of the author is not given, and in the 54th inscription of Shravanabelagola, Shri

Vardhadeva is said to be the poet of the 'Chudamani' named Sevya Kavya, and a verse praising him has also been quoted by the poet Dandi, as follows:
"Chudamanih Kavinaam Chudamani-nama-sevya-kavya-kavi. Srivardhadeva eva hi kritapunya kirtimahattum."  The one who is thus praised by Dandi, "Jo: kanyam jatagrena babhara parameshvara. Srivardhadeva sandhatse jihvagrena sarasvati." It seems that only because of the similarity of the name 'Chudamani' in this text -  Tumbuluracharya and Srivardhadeva have been declared as one person. But in the Rajavali Kathe and Karnatak Shabdanusasan, the 'Chudamani' is presented as a commentary (tika granth) in a way that is not mentioned in the inscription. The inscription clearly states it as a 'Sevya-Kavya' and there is no indication that the Kavya is in the Kannada language. Besides this, there is no mention of Srivardhadeva's name along with the said commentary in Rajavali Kathe etc. Therefore, considering both as one text and equating Tumbuddharacharya with Avirddhadeva on that basis is not without doubt. It is not surprising that there may be a separate excellent Sanskrit Kavya named 'Chudamani' and Dandi, who himself was a great poet of the Sanskrit language, may have said the above verse in praise of Srivardhadeva. But if this is the case... 1 i.e. - O Srivardhadeva! Mahadeva had taken Ganga in his matted hair

Let it be assumed, and it is right to assume, that the Dandīkavi-prashasti-stuta Śrīvardhadeva and Tumbulūra-ācārya were both the same person, then we have no hesitation in saying that the scholar who is presented in the Śruta-avatāra as succeeding Tumbulūra-ācārya is not correct; because from the above-mentioned verse of Dandī, Śrīvardhadeva appears to be a contemporary scholar of Dandī, and Dandī was a scholar of the sixth century CE or the seventh century Vikram era. * In such a situation, Śrīvardhadeva cannot be a scholar before Samantabhadra in any way; rather, he appears to be a scholar several centuries later.

'Aryadeva', after Aryadeva, 'Singhanandi' Acharya, who established the Ganga Kingdom, and after Singhanandi, 'Sumati Bhattaraka' in one accord. After them, up to 'Kamalabhdra', the names of many other Acharyas and in some places, the order of their works were also mentioned. A part of this inscription is as follows:
"

From this inscription, it is clearly mentioned that Singhanandi Acharya, who is associated with the establishment of the Ganga Kingdom, came after Samantabhadra Swami. Although, in this inscription, the names of some Acharyas are found in a mixed order - for example, Bhadrabahu Swami is mentioned as a scholar who came after Kundakunda - and therefore, this inscription cannot be considered as complete evidence regarding the order of the Acharyas; still, it places Singhanandi after Samantabhadra.
1 Singhanandi's epithet: 'Ganga Rajyam Maadide' has been translated by Lewis Rice as 'who made the Ganga Kingdom' - meaning, 'who established the Ganga Kingdom' (he is Singhanandi Acharya).

Such as "...Shrutakeli Gal Enisid (Anip 37) Bhadrabahu Swamigal (Galang 37) Modalagi Palambar (Halambar 37) Acharya Podimbaliyam Samantabhadra Swamigal Udapisidar Avar Anvayadol (Anantaram 37) Gangarajyam Maadi Singhnandyaacharyar Avari..."-
Apart from this, no other inscription has been found in which both Samantabhadra and Singhnandi are mentioned, with Singhnandi being mentioned as a scholar before Samantabhadra or at least Singhnandi's name being mentioned before Samantabhadra. In such a situation, it is more likely that Samantabhadra was a scholar before Singhnandi. If the situation is indeed like this, then it supports the assumption of Mr. Lewis Rice, which he had made only by seeing the mention of these scholars in the Mallisena Prasasti, and therefore which was incomplete and insufficient. In the inscriptions found in these Bodhis, the words 'Avari', 'Avar Anvayadolu' and 'Avar Anantaram' by
1 This is a part of the 36th inscription, in the 37th it is also given almost in the same way, where there is some difference it has been shown in brackets and numbered 37.
2 Mallisena Prasasti is the 54th inscription of Shravanabelagola, which was published in 1889, and the aforementioned inscriptions of Nagar Taluk were published in 1904. They were not available to Mr. Rice in 1889.

195 It has been clearly stated that Simhanandi came after Samantabhadra. Thus, this Simhanandi was contemporary to the first king of the Ganga dynasty, 'Kongunivarma', and this fact has already been made clear. There is much mention in many inscriptions of what help Simhanandi provided in the establishment of the Ganga kingdom, which does not seem necessary to quote here. Here, we only consider it appropriate to reveal that the time of Kongunivarma is considered to be the second century AD. One of his inscriptions has been obtained from the 'Nanjangud' taluk of Saka Samvat 25, which shows that Kongunivarma ascended the throne in Vikram Samvat 160 (AD 103). This time should be approximately the time of Simhanandi,
and therefore it should be said that Samantabhadra came before Vikram Samvat 160; but how much earlier, is not revealed. Nevertheless, assuming the former, it can be assumed that Samantabhadra was at least 30 years earlier; because in the 35th inscription, there is also mention of three acharyas named Aryadeva, Vardatta and Shivkoti before Simhanandi, for whom assuming 10-10 years is not too much. From this, Samantabhadra appears to be a scholar of the first half of the second century Vikram. And this time coincides with the time
1 The number of this inscription is 110 and the beginning is as follows

Swami Samantabhadra, who is considered to be the disciple of Kundakunda's Bhadrabahu and whose death is accepted as per the Vikram Samvat, as mentioned above, or whose time is calculated based on the time of Kundakunda as given in the lineage of the Nandisangh, assuming Bhadrabahu to be established as an Acharya in the 4th Vikram Samvat. Thus, from this discussion regarding time, readers can understand themselves how many obstacles are being created in the path of determining the time of Samantabhadra - what difficulties are arising - and what kind of difficult or complex problems are present, without resolving or solving which, a definite and well-examined statement cannot be made about the actual time of Samantabhadra. However, it is certain that Samantabhadra did not exist after the 5th century Vikram or after 450 AD; and he does not appear to be a scholar before the 1st century Vikram - he existed sometime between the 1st and 5th centuries. Considering broadly, Samantabhadra appears to be a scholar of the 2nd or 2nd and 3rd centuries Vikram. But this cannot be said with certainty yet. A detailed consideration of this time will be done at the time of the next edition when the opportunity arises. There is no doubt that the time of many ancient Acharyas is in a similar state of uncertainty and confusion and needs to be rectified. Once the time of Samantabhadra is established, the time of all of them will be rectified to a great extent. Along with this, the problems of Veer Nirvan, Vikram and Shaka Samvats will also be solved; such a strong hope is held.

Those scholars who, after reading this essay on time determination, will suggest any specific point that will help us in the decision, we will be grateful to them from the heart.

##  Introduction to the Text

Swami Samantabhadracharya composed numerous texts. This introduction aims to provide information about the titles, subjects, number of verses, and commentaries written on these texts. While we are unable to provide a complete account due to limitations, we will present an overview of the available texts and those mentioned in various sources.

**1. Atma-Mimamsa:** This is the most prominent text by Samantabhadracharya, and its title clearly reflects its subject matter. It is also known as the "Devagam" Stotra. Just as the names of many stotras like "Bhaktamar" are derived from their initial syllables, this text is called "Devagam" because it begins with the words "Devagam." Alternatively, this text is called "Devagam" because it reveals the essence of the Arhant Devas, making their nature clear and unveiling their mysteries. This text contains 114 verses or karikas. However, after verse 114, titled "Itiyamaptmimamsa," Acharya Vasunandi, in his "Devagamavritti," has included the following verse: 

Page #286:
---------------------------
Samantbhadra, the Lord,
Conquers the world, a radiant moon dispelling the darkness of afflictions and illusions,
A beacon of truth, dispelling the darkness of doubt and uncertainty.
He is the leader of the ascetics, a vast ocean of knowledge,
Whose teachings are revered by the Tirthankaras and others. || 115 ||

If this verse had been included at the end of the commentary, we could have concluded that it was composed by Vasunandi Acharya, and that he had included it as a concluding blessing. However, he has provided a commentary on this verse, and also a preceding introductory sentence:

"Having fulfilled his promise to expound the truth, the Acharya, Shri Samantbhadra Kesari, with his sharp claws of logic, has torn apart the arguments of his opponents, and with his mighty blows has shattered the foundations of their pride. He says - "

This makes two things clear: first, that this verse is not by Vasunandi Acharya, and second, that Vasunandi considered it to be a verse by Samantbhadra, included as a concluding blessing in the original text, and that he included it with a commentary and an introduction. However, it is certainly debatable whether this verse is actually the final verse of the original text, and this is what we will consider here.

Bhattakalankadeva wrote a commentary on this text called "Ashta Shati", and Shri Vidyānanda Acharya wrote a large commentary called "Ashta Sahasri", also known as "Aapta Mimamsa Alankarati" and "Devagama Alankarati". In both of these primary and ancient commentaries, this verse is not accepted as part of the original text, nor is there any mention of it. 

Page #287:
---------------------------
##  Introduction to the Text

The explanation has been given. This verse is not found in the 'Ashta Shatī'. However, it is included in the 'Ashta Sahasrī' after the completion of the commentary, with the following sentence:
"Some consider this to be a auspicious verse at the end of the scripture."

After presenting the aforementioned verse, the 'Ashta Shatī' concludes with the final auspicious verse attributed to Shrimad Kalankdeva, preceded by the sentence:
"Shrimad Kalankdeva further says..."

Subsequently, Shri Vidyānanda Āchārya provides his own final auspicious verse, accompanied by the sentence:
"Thus, we present this well-known auspicious verse, praising the virtues of the lineage of our past teachers, due to our own devotion."

These statements in the 'Ashta Sahasrī' clearly indicate that this verse, like the final auspicious verses of the 'Ashta Shatī' and 'Ashta Sahasrī', is an auspicious verse from another older commentary. Vidyānanda Āchārya may not have been familiar with it, or even if he was, he might not have known the name of its author. Therefore, like Kalankdeva, he simply mentions it using the word "some". We also believe this to be the case. The structure of the text does not support the inclusion of this verse. It seems that Vasunandi Āchārya obtained a manuscript of the 'Devāgama' that was either directly or indirectly copied from a commentary containing this auspicious verse, which was mistakenly included in the copy. Such errors are often found in manuscripts due to the carelessness of scribes. Similarly, the 'Brihat Svayambhu Stotra' published in the 'Sanātana Granthamālā' also includes a commentary verse at the end, "Yo niḥśeṣa jino…"

Swami Samantabhadra.
The verse named is given in its original form and numbered 144. But it is not a verse of the original text. ... Apart from the four commentaries of Aapta Mimamsa mentioned above, there seems to be a fifth commentary called 'Devagam-Padya Vartika Alankar', which is mentioned in the Yukt-Anusasan-Tika as follows:
'Iti Devagam Padya Vartika Alankare Niroopit Prayam'.
This suggests that this commentary is mostly in verse. It is not known who its author was. It is possible that like 'Tattvarth Shlok Chartika Alankar', the author of this 'Devagam Padya Vartika Alankar' is also Shri Vidyānanda Acharya, and in this way he wrote two commentaries on this text, one in prose (Ashta Sahasri) and the other in verse. But this cannot be said with certainty yet. However, among these commentaries, there is a commentary called 'Ashta Sahasri Visham Pad Tatparya Tika' on 'Ashta Sahasri' written by Laghu Samantabhadra Acharya, and another commentary written by the great Acharya and Nyaya scholar of the Shwetambar sect, Upadhyay Shri Yashovijayji. Each commentary is as large as Ashta Sahasri - that is, both are eight thousand verses long. But despite all this, even in the presence of such large and powerful commentaries, 'Devagam' remains obscure and difficult to understand for scholars.

##  Introduction to the Text | 201

From this, readers can understand for themselves how much importance, depth, and profound meaning are contained in the 114 verses of this text. Therefore, there is no exaggeration in the way that Shri Viranand Acharya, like the 'Nirmalvrittamouktika Harayashti', and Narendra Sena Acharya, like 'Manushyattva', have described Samantabhadra's Bharti as 'rare'. In fact, every word of every verse of this text is a 'sutra' and has been carefully considered - not a single letter is wasted. This is why Samantabhadra has been able to fill this small vessel with the ocean of secrets of all the different doctrines, and therefore, to understand it, there is a special need for deep study, deep contemplation, and a vast heart.

A commentary by Pandit Jayachandraji in Hindi is also available on this text, which is mostly simple. This was the first commentary available to us, and from it we gained some initial understanding of this text. At that time, this text was not published, and therefore, with great love, we copied this text by hand, along with the said commentary. That copy is still preserved in our library. Since then, we have been constantly looking at this original text, and it seems very dear to us.

There will also be many commentaries, descriptions, and commentaries on this text in Kannada, Tamil, and other languages, but we have no information about them.
* In this regard, Shwetambar Sadhu Munijinavijayji also writes,
"This appears to be a small text of 114 verses, but its depth is such that even after writing large, profound commentaries and descriptions of hundreds of thousands of verses, scholars find it inaccessible." Jainhitaishi Part 14, Issue 6.

## 2 Yuktyanusasan...
This work of Samantabhadra is also very important and unique, and each verse is full of profound meaning. In it, through a system of hymns, the merits and demerits of one's own and other doctrines are described in a concise manner, using 64 verses. Each topic is presented with great skill, using strong arguments. This text is a means of seeking truth for the inquisitive and was written with this main objective in mind, as was already made clear in the introduction to Samantabhadra, based on one of his verses. Shri Jinaseanacharya has described it as equivalent to the words of Mahavira Bhagwan. So far, only one beautiful Sanskrit commentary by Shri Vidyānandaācārya is available on this text, and it has also been published in the "Manikchand-Granthamala". The following introductory sentence of this commentary suggests that this text was written after "Aapta Mimamsa":
"Shrimat Samantabhadra Swami, after the Aapta Mimamsa, by the other yoga separation, not established by the Bhagavan Shrimat Arhata Antya Tirthankara Paramdeva, examined me and asked, "What do you want to do?"
* In the first fascicle of the "Sanatan Jain Granthamala" published in 1905, the number of verses in this text is given as 65, but this is a mistake. The verse titled "Stotre Yuktyanusasane" at number 40 is a verse of the commentator, not of the original text. And due to the wrong numbering of the verses in this text published in the Ma. Granthamala, the number 65 appears.

##  **Text Introduction** |
**3. 'Svayambhu' Stotra** |
This is also called 'Brihatsvayambhu Stotra' and 'Samantbhadra Stotra'. It is called 'Svayambhu Stotra' because it begins with the word 'Svayambhuva'. Since another shorter 'Svayambhu Stotra' is prevalent in society, this one is called 'Brihatsvayambhu Stotra'. And because it was composed by Samantbhadra, it is called 'Samantbhadra Stotra'.  Furthermore, it contains praise for the twenty-four Svayambhus - Tirthankaras or Jinadevas - which also makes 'Svayambhu Stotra' a meaningful name for this text. This text praises twenty-one Tirthankaras in five verses each, excluding Ara, Nemi, and Mahavira. The verses praising these three Tirthankaras are 20, 10, and 8 respectively. Thus, the total number of verses in this text is 143. This text is very important, filled with pure verses, adorned with pleasant and short words, and its main subject is to expound the Dharma of the twenty-four Jinadevas.  It also mentions some mythological and historical facts about certain Tirthankaras, which are very interesting.  Apart from these mentions, the entire text is filled with philosophical descriptions and religious teachings. This text is worthy of being read daily with proper understanding.

Only one Sanskrit commentary on this text, by Prabhachandra Acharya, the commentator of the Kriyakalpaka, is available so far. The commentary...

It is generally good, but not sufficient to fully reveal the secrets of the text. There must be another better commentary on this text, which needs to be found from the repositories. This stotra is also included in the 'Kriyakalāpa' text, and there is said to be a commentary by P. Āśādhara on Kriyakalāpa, so there should also be a commentary by P. Āśādhara on this text. 4 Jinastutiśataka |

This text is also known by the names 'Stutividyā,' 'Jinastutiśatam,' 'Jinśataka,' and 'Jinśatakālaṁkāra.' The name 'Stutividyā' comes from the initial pledge sentence of the text, 'Stutividyāṁ prasādhye.' 'Jinastutiśatam' is found from the final kavya-nāma-garbha-chakra-vṛtta of the text. And 'Jinśataka' is the abbreviated name indicated by the commentator in his commentary. Because it is primarily based on alankaras, it is also called 'Jinśatakālaṁkāra.' This text is overflowing with bhakti rasa, is written with great skill and excellence in imagery, is adorned with all alankaras, and is so difficult and challenging that even the best scholars cannot easily understand it without the help of a Sanskrit commentary. Much has already been said about this text. It has 196 verses, and there is only one available Sanskrit commentary on them, which was written by Narasimha Bhaṭṭa. Before Narasimha Bhaṭṭa's commentary, there was no other commentary on this text, as is found from a sentence of the commentator; and this can only mean that at the time of Narasimha or in his country, no commentary on this text was available. Before that 

Page #293:

## Introduction to the Text

There is no commentary on this text, which is incomprehensible and illogical. However, this commentary is good and useful. Samantabhadra, in the first verse of the text, has indicated the purpose of his composition as "to conquer sins" through the phrase "Agasaam Jaye". The commentator has also described this praise as "GhanakathinGhatikamDhanadhanSamartha". From this, readers can experience the spiritual significance of this text.

## Ratnakaranḍaka: A Study of the Practices of the Devotee

This is also known as "Ratnakaranḍaśrāvakācāra". Among the available texts, this is the most important, ancient, excellent, and well-known text on the subject of Śrāvakācāra. Śrīvādirājasūri has called it "Akshayasukhāvah" and Prabhācandra has called it "the pure sun that illuminates the entire ocean path". A detailed account of its special introduction, examination of its verses, and other related topics is given in the introduction to this text.

## Notes

1. The epithet given in the verse of "Pārśvanāthacarita" has already been quoted in "Gunādiparyacaya".
2. See the last verse of the Ratnakaranḍaka commentary, which is as follows:

Here we only want to point out that only one Sanskrit commentary is available on this text so far, which was written by Prabhachandracharya and it is mostly ordinary. Yes, a Sanskrit commentary called 'Ratnakarandakavishampadavyaakhyan' is also found on this text, whose author's name could not be known from it. This commentary is present in the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan in Ara. Some commentaries of this text are also available in Kannada language, but nothing is known about their authors etc. The Tamil language text 'Arungalcheppu' (Ratnakarandaka), which has 180 verses, seems to have been created keeping this text in front, and except for some exceptions, it seems to be almost a paraphrase or summary of it. * But when it was made and who made it, there is no information about it, nor can it be called a commentary in the Tamil language.
6 Jivasiddhi. The knowledge of this text comes from the verse of the 'Harivanshapurana' written by Shri Jinaseenacharya, which has been quoted in the 'Gunadhiparichay'. The subject of the text is revealed by its name itself and it is a very useful subject. Shri Jinaseenacharya has called this discourse of Samantabhadra

## Introduction to the Text

**207**

This text is said to be equivalent to the words of Mahavira Bhagwan. From this, readers can understand the great importance of this text. Unfortunately, this text is not yet available. It is unknown in which repository it is hidden, or if it still exists. There is a great need for its immediate research.

## Tattvanushasan

In the list titled "Digambar Jain Authors and their Texts," one of the texts attributed to Samantabhadra is "Tattvanushasan." The "Jain Granthavali" published by the Shwetambar Conference also lists "Tattvanushasan" as a work of Samantabhadra, and further states that it is mentioned in a private report of Seth Bhagwandas Kalyan Dasji of Surat, who was employed by Mr. Peterson. Several other scholars, while introducing Samantabhadra, have also included "Tattvanushasan" in his list of works. Thus, there is some evidence of the existence of this text. However, this text is not yet available. Even after examining the lists of many famous repositories, we have not been able to find out where this text is located. Nor have we been able to definitively ascertain from any scriptural texts, etc., whether Samantabhadra actually wrote a text with this name. Nevertheless, it is believed that such a text by Samantabhadra must exist. Research has revealed that this "Tattvanushasan" is different from the one by Ramasen, which is printed in the Manikchand Granthamala under the name "Nagesen." 

**1** The name "Nagesen" is a mistake. In reality, the text was written by Ramasen, a disciple of Nagesen. We had proven this point in an article published in the Jain Hitesh in July 1920.

## 208
Swami Samantabhadra.

There is another 'Tattvanusasana' text, a verse of which is found in the 'Nirmala Sarika' commentary of 'Padma Prabha' by Maladharideva, along with the phrase "Tatha choktam Tattvanusasane". This verse is as follows: "Utsaya kayakarmāni bhāvam cha bhavakāraṇam.
- Svātmāvasthānam avyagram kāyoatsargaḥ sa uchyate ||" This verse is not present in the 'Tattvanusasana' published in the 'Manikchand Granthamala', and therefore, there is no hesitation in saying that this is a verse from another 'Tattvanusasana'. The text from which the verse is taken also seems to be of no less importance. It is very likely that the 'Tattvanusasana' containing the aforementioned verse was written by Swami Samantabhadra himself.

Besides this, Shriharibhadrasuri, the chief Acharya of the Svetambara sect, has quoted the following two verses in his 'Anekantjayapataka' under the name 'Vadimukhya Samantabhadra', and these verses are also found quoted under the name of Samantabhadra in 'Pramanakalikā' by Shantyacharya and 'Syadvadratnakara' by Vadidevasuri.

##  Book Introduction

**209**

And in the *Tātparyavṛtti* by Jayasenācārya on the *Samayasāra*, a verse is given as follows, quoting some verses in the name of Samantabhadra:

> *Dharmiṇo 'nantrarūpatvam dharmāṇāṁ na kathaṁcana |*
> *Anekānto 'pyanekānta iti Jainamatam tataḥ ||*

These three verses are not found in the available works of Samantabhadra (Nos. 1 to 5) and therefore it is clear that these are verses from some other work or works of Samantabhadra which are still unknown or unavailable. It is not surprising that these may also be verses from the *Tattvānuśāsana* text. If this is the case and this text becomes available, it should be considered a great fortune for the Jains. In such a situation, there is a great need to search for this text soon.

**8 Prakrit Grammar**

*Jainagranthāvalī* reveals that Samantabhadra also composed a *Prākṛtavyākaraṇa* (Prakrit Grammar) which has 1200 verses. The aforementioned *Granthāvalī* mentions this text based on a report from the Royal Asiatic Society, and the existence of this text is mentioned in the said Society. However, we have not seen this text yet, nor have we been able to see the aforementioned report of the Society; therefore, we cannot provide more information on this subject. *We have written to and requested information from Babu Chhotelalji Jain, Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, Calcutta, several times to see the report, etc., but he has not paid any attention to them, or perhaps he did not consider it appropriate to exert himself for such tasks.*

We do not wish to say anything. However, we can definitely say that if any grammar text written by Swami Samantabhadra is available, it will be a matter of great pride for the Jains. Shri Pujyapada Acharya has also mentioned the opinion of Samantabhadra in his 'Jainendra Vyakaran' through the sutra 'Chatustayam Samantabhadrasya', which makes it not at all unnatural for a grammar of Samantabhadra to be available. 9 Pramanapadartha |
The list of the 'Paduvastibhandar' of Moodbidri reveals that there exists a Sanskrit text named 'Pramanapadartha' written by Samantabhadracharya there and its verse count is 1000. Along with this, it is also written about its subject that it is incomplete. It is not known whether this verse count is along with its commentary or is the extent of the original itself. If the extent of the incomplete original is this much, then it should be said that this is the largest text among the available original texts of Samantabhadra, and being on the subject of Nyaya, it holds great importance. It is also not known how this text is incomplete - whether some of its leaves are lost or the author could not complete it. Without seeing it, nothing can be said about all these things*. However, we definitely want to say that if

* To know the necessary things about this text, two letters were given to Pandit Lokanathji Shastri of Moodbidri. In response to one letter, he had also promised to have the text looked at and provide sufficient information about it, but it is not known what happened due to which he could not give us any further information. If we had received answers to our questions from Shastriji, we could have been able to introduce this text well to the readers.

## Introduction to the Text

This text, in fact, is composed by Samantabhadracharya, so there is a great need to quickly recover it and bring it to light.

## Commentary on Karmapraabhrut

In the Prakrit language, there is a principle text called 'Karmapraabhrut' or 'Karmaprakritipraabhrut' composed by Shri Pushpadanta-Bhootbalyaacharya. This text is divided into six sections: 1) Jeevasthan, 2) Kshullakbandh, 3) Bandhswaamitva, 4) Bhaavedana, 5) Vargana, and 6) Mahabhandh. Therefore, it is also called 'Shatrakhandagam'. Samantabhadra has written a commentary on the first five sections of this text in a very beautiful and gentle Sanskrit language. The number of verses in this commentary is forty-eight thousand; this is found in the following verses of the 'Shrutavatar' text composed by Shri Indranandyaacharya. It is also known that Samantabhadra wanted to write an explanation of the second principle text called 'Kashaya Praabhrut'; however, due to the lack of efforts in purifying substances, etc., one of his fellow practitioners (brother in faith) stopped him from doing so.

## 212
Swami Samantabhadra.
This introduction also mentions the specific place or village where the logical sun, Swami Samantabhadra, rose and illuminated the meaning of the karma-influenced principles with his commentary. However, due to some errors in the text, the name could not be clearly understood. By replacing 'आसन्ध्यां पलरि' with 'आसीद्यः पलरि', Pandit Jinadas Parsvanathji Fadkule has interpreted it as 'आनंद नांवाच्या गांवांत' - in the village of Anand. However, it is not clear how this interpretation can be derived from the second reading. Upon inquiry, the Pandit writes, "In the Marathi translation of the Shrutapanchami Kriya, it is written that Samantabhadracharya was born in Anand." Based solely on this, you have interpreted 'पलार' as 'in the village of Anand', which does not seem correct, nor does your reading of 'आसीद्यः' seem accurate to us. Because the verb 'अभूत' exists, the verb 'आसीत्' becomes redundant. In our opinion, if the word 'पलर' or a similar word is used in the sense of 'village' in the Karnataka region, and its form in the seventh case is 'पलरि', then it can be said that the reading should be 'आनंद्यां' instead of 'आसन्ध्यां'. This would then suggest that Samantabhadra composed this commentary while staying in 'Aanand Palli' or 'Aanand Math'.

##  Introduction to the Text | 213

The number is 84,000, and the 'Devagam' stotra is its mangalacharan. This text has been searched for years. The renowned philanthropist Seth Manikchand Hirachandji J.P. of Bombay had offered a reward of five hundred rupees in cash for merely showing it. We too, captivated by the 'Devagam', had resolved at that time that if this text were to be found, we would spend the rest of our lives studying, contemplating, and promoting it. But till today, no trace of this text has been found in any repository. Once, there was news in the newspapers that this text was present in the library of a famous city (Vienna) in Austria. And there was even a plan to send one or two scholars there to get a copy of the text, and some contributions were also collected for this purpose. But later it was found that the news was false - there was a mistake in its origin - and therefore the hope that had blossomed in the hearts of the people yearning to see it was again turned into despair.

We do not stop searching for the existence of this text in Jain literature - we are not deterred or become disheartened or weak - it is called 'Gandhasti'. Due to this quality, some special scholars have also been adorned with this title. Samantabhadra could not be countered, this has been explained in detail in the 'Gunadhiparyaya' earlier; from this, 'Gandhasti' must have been the title or epithet of Samantabhadra, and from this, his Mahabhashya is called Gandhasti Mahabhashya. Or, because of being equal to Gandhasti, it is called Gandhasti Mahabhashya, and from this, it should be understood that it is the best commentary - other commentaries appear pale, lacking in glory, and weak in comparison to it.

Are coming. The essence of what is known about this text from ancient Jain literature through the references found so far is as follows:
(1) A verse is found in the praise of the play 'Vikrant Kaurva' by the poet Hastimalla, as follows:
Tattvarthasutravyakhyanagandhahastipravartakah.
Swami Samantabhadro'bhudevaagama nideshakah.  _ This same verse is also given in the praise of the text 'Jinendrakalyanabhyudaya', which was completed by Pandit Ayyapaarya in Saka Samvat 1241; and in some of its copies, the reading 'vidhayakah' is found in place of 'pravartakah' and 'kavishvarah' in place of 'nideshakah'; but there is no difference in meaning or, to put it another way, there is no difference in the subject matter of the verse. This verse states that "Swami Samantabhadra was the originator - or creator - of the commentary (bhashya) called 'Gandhasti' on the 'Tattvarthasutra' and was also the director - or poet laureate - of the 'Devagama'."
This reference makes it clear that Samantabhadra wrote a commentary or a great commentary called 'Gandhasti' on the 'Tattvarthasutra', but it is not clear whether the 'Devagama' (Aapta Mimamsa) is the mangalacharan of that commentary. If the 'Devagama' was just a part of that commentary in the form of a mangalacharan, there would have been no need to mention it separately here; the separate mention of its name in this verse clearly indicates 
1 The poet Hastimalla lived in the 14th century of the Vikram era.

It emerges that it is an independent and principal text of Samantabhadra. The final Karika of Devagam (Aapta-Mimamsa) also appears to confirm this sentiment and it is as follows:

"**iti yamasmimamsa vihita hitamicchataam. samyagmithyopadesarthavisheshpratipattaye**"

Vasu-nandi Acharya, in his commentary, has called this Karika "**Shastra-artha-upasamhāra-karika**", and at the end of its commentary, he has mentioned it with epithets like "**kritakrityaḥ nirvyūḍhatattvapratijñaḥ**" etc. Vidyananda Acharya, in the Ashta-sahasri, has indicated the completion of the work started - the completion of the work started - by this Karika, and has called Devagam "**svotparicched shastra**" - that is, it has been stated that the division of ten chapters found in this scripture is done by Swami Samantabhadra himself. Akalankadeva has also made the same statement. And from all this statement,

1. "**For those who desire their own good, this 'Aapta-Mimamsa' has been said for the understanding of the special meaning of the right and wrong teachings.**"
2. "**The Karika that concludes the subject of the scripture or indicates its end.**"
3. "**These two epithets indicate the completion of the text started by Samantabhadra.**"
4. "**iti devagamakhye svotparicched shastre (svenoktaḥ paricchedā daśa yasminstat svotparicchedamiti grāhyam tatra) vihiteyamaapta-mimamsa sarvajñavishesh-parīkṣā......**" Ashta-sahasri.
5. "**iti svotparicchedvihiteyamaapta-mimamsa sarvajñavisheshparīkṣā.**" - Ashta-shati.

It is found that 'Devagama' is an independent scripture, which ends with the said karika; and it does not appear to be the initial mangalacharan of any commentary or commentary, because the method of mangalacharan in the form of namaskaradi, which is found while writing a commentary or commentary on a text, seems different from this and no such chapter division is seen in it. Apart from this, the said karika does not indicate that mangalacharan has been done here, nor has any of the three commentators of the text - Akalanka, Vidyānanda and Vasunandī named acharyas - indicated it as 'Gandhasti Mahabhashya's mangalacharan' in their commentary, but the name of Gandhasti Mahabhashya is not even mentioned anywhere. And also from many other mentions, Devagama (Aptamimamsa) is mentioned as an independent text. And therefore, from the said verse of poet Hastimalla etc.

The conclusion drawn regarding the freedom from the Devagamas is largely supported.

It is not clear from the verse cited by the poet Hastimalla, etc., whether the Tattvarthasutra on which Samantabhadra wrote the commentary called Gandhasti is the same as the 'Tattvarthasutra' or 'Tattvarthashastra' of Umashvati, or some other Tattvarthasutra. It is possible that it is the same Tattvarthasutra of Umashvati, but it is also possible that it is a different Tattvarthasutra or Tattvarthashastra, composed by some other learned Acharya; because Umashvati was not the only author of Tattvarthasutras - there were other Acharyas as well, and the meaning of the Sutra is not only a concise statement or group of statements in prose, but it is also a synonym for 'Shastra', and poetic Shastras are also meant by it. For example:

* "Composed by Kayastha Padmanabha from the Purvasutra." - Yashodharacharitra.
* "Thus I have also stated here, knowing from the Shri Jinasutra." - Bhadrabahucharitra.
* "The essence of the Pavayana, the five-fold collection of Sutras." - Pancharitakaya.
* "The Devagamanasutra, with its scriptural evidence and clear understanding." - V. Kaurava Pra.
* "This is also to be seen in detail in the Mulaaradhanaatika, in the Susthitasutra." - Anagaradharmamritatika.

Therefore, the meaning of Tattvarthasutra is 'Shastra on the subject of Tattvartha', and from this, the Tattvarthasutra of Umashvati is called 'Tattvarthashastra' and 'Tattvarthadhigamamoksha Shastra'. 'Siddhantashastra' and 'Radhantasutra' are also... 1 This is the name of a chapter in the 'Bhagavati Aradhana' Shastra, which is in verse form. 

Page #306:

Swami Samantabhadra.
Tattvarthashastra or Tattvarthasutra are synonyms.  Aryadeva is described as the author of 'Tattvarthasutra' in one place and 'Radhdhanta' in another. * And the Siddhanta Shastras composed by Pushpadanta, Bhootbalya and other Acharyas are also called Tattvarthashastra or Tattvarthamahashastra.  On these Siddhanta Shastras, Tumbuddharacharya wrote a large commentary in Kannada language called 'Chudamani', the size of which is mentioned as 84,000 verses in Indranandi's 'Shrutavatar' and 96,000 verses in 'Karnataka Shabdanusasan'.  Bhattakalankdeva, while explaining the usefulness of Kannada language in his 'Karnataka Shabdanusasan', mentions this commentary as follows:
"Nor is this (Kannada) language unsuitable for scriptures.  Because of the availability of many scriptures composed in this language, such as the commentary on Tattvarthamahashastra, which is a book of 96,000 verses, called Chudamani, and other scriptures on Shabdagama, Yuktagam, Parmagam, and subjects like poetry, drama, and art." * For example - (1) "......Avari Tattvarthasutrakartugal Enisi Siddha Aryadevara..."
- Nagaratallukeka Shi. Lekha No. 350. (2) "Acharyavaryo Yatira Aryadevo Radhdhantakartta Dhriyatans Murdhni."
Shra. Be. Shilashekh No. 54 (67). 1 These are different Bhattakalank from the one who authored 'Ashtshati' etc., who lived in the 17th century Vikram.  He completed 'Karnataka Shabdanusasan' in 1604 AD (Shaka 1526).

This mention clearly indicates that the 'Chudamani' is a commentary on both the 'Karmapraabhut' and 'Kshayapraabhut' principle scriptures, which are referred to here as the 'Tattvarthamahaashaastra'. This supports the equivalence of 'Siddhantashaastra' and 'Tattvarthashaastra', and it is also found that the 'Karmapraabhut' and 'Kshayapraabhut' texts were called 'Tattvarthashaastra'. Since they deal with the subject of Tattvartha, calling them 'Tattvarthashaastra' or 'Tattvarthsutra' does not seem inappropriate.

Samantbhadra has also written an extensive Sanskrit commentary on the 'Karmapraabhut' principle, which has been introduced earlier and whose number of verses, according to 'Indranandi-Shrutaavataar', is 48,000 and according to 'Vibudhshridhar-virachit Shrutaavataar', is 68,000. In such a situation, it is not surprising that the poet Hastimalla, etc., in his aforementioned verse, has indicated the same commentary or commentary as the 'Gandhasti' commentary of the 'Tattvarthsutra' by Samantbhadra. Until it is known without any doubt, through a strong and valid proof, that Samantbhadra had composed a 'Gandhasti' Mahaabhaashya on Umaswati's Tattvarthsutra, his aforementioned principle commentary can also be considered as the Gandhasti Mahaabhaashya, and this verse does not seem to be an obstacle in that.

(2) There is an incomplete text in the Kannada language, written on palm leaves, in the Jain Siddhanta Bhavan in Ara, whose name and the name of its author could not be known, and whose subject is Umaswati's Tattvarthaadhigam

This passage relates to the third chapter of the Sutra. At the beginning of this text, the following sentence is written in bold letters as a salutation: " _Namoastu to the divine Sri Pada Padma Galige, the Acharya Lakshmi Sena, the descendant of Samantabhadra, the lord of the Devagama, the master of Syadvada Vidya, who composed the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya, a commentary on the Tattvartha, comprising 96,000 verses (k)_. " This sentence pays homage to the lotus feet of Lakshmi Sena Acharya, a resident of Penugonde, and also states that he belonged to the lineage of Samantabhadra Acharya, who authored the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya, a commentary on the Tattvartha, comprising 96,000 verses, and who was the lord of the Devagama and the master of Syadvada Vidya.

Of the three epithets given to Samantabhadra here, the first two are almost identical to those found in the play "Vikranta Kaurava" and the verses of "Jinendra Kalyana Abyudaya," especially in its variant readings. The only difference is that here, "Tattvartha Sutra Vyakhyan" is replaced by "Tattvartha Vyakhyan" and "Gandhasti" is replaced by "Gandhasti Maha Bhashya." Additionally, the size of the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya is given as 96,000 verses, which is 12,000 more than its commonly accepted size (84,000).

1. The inscription of a disciple of Lakshmi Sena Acharya, Malli Shandev, is found in the 168th inscription of Shravanabelagola, which is said to be from around 1400 AD. It is possible that this inscription refers to the disciple of this Lakshmi Sena, which would make Lakshmi Sena a scholar from around the 14th century. Two other scholars named Lakshmi Sena have been found, but they are Acharyas from the 16th and 18th centuries.

This mention also reveals that 'Devagam' is an independent and principal text, and it is not known whether the 'Tattvarth' text that Gandhastimihaabhashya is a commentary on is Umaswati's 'Tattvarthsutra' or some other Tattvarthashastra; and therefore, whatever speculation and discussion has been done on this subject should be understood here as well. As for the number of verses, it is certainly different from its prevalent quantity and also different from the quantity of Karmapraabhruttika which is mentioned in the 'Shrutavatar' texts of Indranandi and Vibudh Shridhar. In such a situation, it is necessary to find out which number is correct. In the available Jain literature, there is no support for the prevalent number from any Acharya's text or ancient inscription - that is, there is no mention that the number of verses in Gandhastimihaabhashya is 84,000; - rather, there is no mention that Samantabhadra created any text with 84,000 verses, which is associated with Gandhastimihaabhashya; and therefore, the origin of the prevalent number of the Mahaabhashya is not known, so it can be doubted. In Shrutavatar, the number of the Kannada Bhashya named 'Chudamani' is given as 85,000; but in Karnataka Shabdanushaasan, Bhattakalankadeva writes its number as 96,000 and this number seems to be written after seeing the text itself; because he has described the text as 'upalabhyaman'. This can also give rise to doubt about the number 48,000 given in Shrutavatar for Samantabhadra's Siddhantagam-Bhashya, especially...

222
Samantbhadra. In such a situation, when the number of his *Shrutavatara* is given as 68,000 in Vibudha Shridhara's work. It is possible that the number is 84,000 - due to the digits being written in reverse order, 48,000 may have been written somewhere and based on that, 48,000 may have been wrongly mentioned - or it may be 96,000 or 68,000 or something else; and it is also possible that the number given in the said sentence is not correct - it may have been written in place of 84,000 or 48,000 etc. due to some mistake. But for all these things, special research and investigation is needed and only then can anything definite be said. Yes, if the number of the *Mahabhashya* given in the said sentence and the number of Samantbhadra's *Siddhantāgamabhāṣya* given in one *Shrutavatara* are both proved to be true, then it can definitely be said that Samantbhadra's *Gandhastimāhabhāṣya* is different from his *Siddhantāgamabhāṣya* (*Karmaprābhṛta-ṭīkā*), and it could be a commentary on Umasvati's *Tattvārthasūtra*.
(3) Two commentaries named *Rājavārtika* and *Śloka-vārtika* are available on Umasvati's *Tattvārthasūtra*, which are respectively by Akalankadeva and 
1 Writing the digits in reverse order is not unnatural, it sometimes happens in haste. For example, take Dr. Satishchandra's *History of Indian Logic*, in it, while mentioning the age of Umasvati, 48 years has been written instead of 84, due to this reversal of digits. Otherwise, Dr. Sahib has given the time of Umasvati from 1 AD to 85 AD. If he had not given this, there could have been even more confusion regarding the age.

## Introduction to the Text

These *Vārtikas* were composed by Vidyānanda Ācārya. They are written in the style of *Vārtikas* and are called *Vārtikas*. *Vārtikas* address three types of meanings: what is said, what is not said, and what is said incorrectly. This is evident from the definition of *Vārtikas* as propounded by Śrī Hemacandra Ācārya:

"A *Vārtika* is that which considers the meaning of what is said, what is not said, and what is said incorrectly."

Due to this, the size of *Vārtika* commentaries is often larger than the original commentaries. For example, the *Rāja Vārtika* is larger than the *Sarvārthasiddhi*, and the *Śloka Vārtika* is larger than the *Rāja Vārtika*.

If Samantabhadra's commentary on the *Tattvārthasūtra* was indeed 84,000 or 96,000 verses long, as is claimed, then the *Vārtika* commentaries of Akalankadeva and Vidyānanda should have been larger. However, they are significantly smaller. This leads to the conclusion that either Samantabhadra did not write such a commentary on the *Tattvārthasūtra* - the commentary he wrote on the *Siddhāntagrantha* is likely what is called the "Gandhahasti Mahābhāṣya" - or that it was lost before the time of Akalankadeva and Vidyānanda, and was not available to them.

2. It is not implied that the size of other types of commentaries or *ṭīkās* (commentaries) different from *Vārtika* commentaries also increases. They can be as small as they need to be.

Swami Samantabhadra. (4) In the commentary on the 'Upejñāte' sutra of the Śākaṭāyana grammar, the commentator Śrī Abhayacandra Sūri writes:
"Tṛtīyāntād upejñāte prathamto jñāte yathāyogaṁ aṇādayo bhavanti || Arhatā prathamto jñātaṁ āhetam pravacanaṁ | Sāmantabhadraṁ mahābhāṣyamityādi ||"
1 This is the 182nd sutra of the first pada of the third chapter and its serial number is 746 in the printed 'Prakriyāsaṁgraha' of Abhayacandra Sūri. See, the edition of 1907 printed in the 'Jainendra Mudrṇālaya' of Kolhapur.
2 This Abhayacandra Sūri seems to be the same Abhayacandra Siddhāntacakravartī who was the guru of Keśavavarṇī and the author of the 'Mandaprabodhikā' commentary on the 'Gommatasāra';
and he also seems to be the commentator of the 'Laghīyastraya'. In the commentary on the 'Laghīyastraya', the commentator has revealed himself as the disciple of Muni Candra and has also saluted Muni Candra in the mangalācaraṇa; in the 'Mandaprabodhikā' commentary also, 'Muni' has been saluted and in this 'Prakriyāsaṁgraha' commentary on the Śākaṭāyana grammar, 'Munīndra' is also found to be saluted and that 'Munīndra' (=Muni Candra) could also be a variant reading. Along with this, the style of the mangalācaraṇas of these three commentaries is also found to be one - in each, besides their own guru, the original author and Jineśvara (Jinādhiśa) have also been saluted and the name of the commentary has also been given along with the promise to write the commentary. From this, these three commentators seem to be the same person and seem to be the disciples of Muni Candra. Keśavavarṇī completed the Kannada commentary on the 'Gommatasāra' in Śaka Saṁvat 1281 (Vi. Saṁvat 1416), and Muni Candra was a scholar of the 13th and 14th centuries of Vikrama. A mention of his existence is found in the Saundatti inscription in Śaka Saṁvat 1151 (Vi. Saṁvat 1286) and another in the 137 (347) number inscription of Śravaṇa Belgola in Śaka Saṁvat 1200 (Vi. Saṁvat 1335). Therefore, this Abhayacandra Sūri seems to be a scholar of the 14th century of Vikrama. It is very likely that this Abhayacandra is the same Abhayasūri Saiddhantic who was the guru of 'Śrutamuni'.

Here, two examples are given of forms that occur with the suffixes *aṇādi* in the sense of *tṛtīyānta* (third case ending) - one is *āhet-pravacana* and the other is *sāmanta-bhadra-mahābhāṣya*.  Additionally, the meaning of *upajñāta* is given as *prathamato jñāta* - known first without instruction.  *Amarakośa* also writes *ādyajñāna* as *upajñā*.  From this perspective, the *pravacana* first known by the *arhanta* is called *āhet-pravacana*, in the same way, the *mahābhāṣya* first known by *sāmanta-bhadra* without instruction is called *sāmanta-bhadra-mahābhāṣya*.  This should be understood as meaning that *sāmanta-bhadra*’s *mahābhāṣya* is his own *svopjñā* commentary - a commentary written on his own text.  Otherwise, it would be mentioned in the commentary on the sūtra *ṭaḥ prokte*, where examples of forms made with these suffixes in the sense of *prokta* and *vyākhyāta* are given, and *sāmanta-bhadra* is also an example, but the word *mahābhāṣya* is not mentioned with it.

And those who are written as complete knowers (scholars) of *śabdāgama*, *paramāgama*, and *tarkāgama* in the praise of *śrutamuni*’s *bhāvasaṅgraha*.  Their time is also found here; because *śrutamuni*’s *aṇuvrata-guru* and *guru-bhrātā* *bāla-candra muni* wrote a commentary on the *dravya-saṅgraha* sūtra in Śaka Saṃvat 1195 (Vikrama Saṃvat 1330) (see *Karnāṭaka-kavi-carita*).  But *śrutamuni*’s *dīkṣā-guru* *abhaya-candra* *saiddhanta* seems to be different from this *abhaya-candra-sūri*; because in the Śravaṇa-belagola inscriptions no. 41 and 105, he is written as the disciple of *māgha-nandī*.  But his time is also the 13th and 14th centuries of Vikrama.  The existence of some other scholars named *abhaya-candra* is found in the 16th and 17th centuries of Vikrama.  But they do not seem to be the authors of this *prakriyā-saṅgraha*.

1. This is the 169th sūtra of the first pāda of the same third chapter; and its serial number in *prakriyā-saṅgraha* is given as 743.

No. Because the commentator of a commentary on another's work, or rather, the first knowledge of the meaning of that work, does not belong to the commentator but to the original author. But here we do not need to go into this discussion further. We only want to point out from this mention that it mentions Samantabhadra's Maha-bhashya and refers to it by the name 'Samantabhadra Maha-bhashya' rather than 'Gandhasti'. But this mention does not reveal which work the commentary is written on. Like Umaswati's Tattvartha Sutra, it could be a commentary on the Karma Prabhat Siddhanta or on his own work. In such a situation, apart from knowing something about the creation of the Maha-bhashya, this mention does not yield any other special feature.
(5) In one place in the Swetambar text called Syadvadamanjari, the difference between Avayava and Pradesh is mentioned as follows, citing the texts 'Gandhasti' etc.
“Yadyapyavayavapradeshayorgandhastiyadishu bhedos'ti tathapi natra sukshmeksika chintya." This mention only reveals the existence of a text called 'Gandhasti' but it does not reveal whether it is the original text or a commentary, Digambar or Swetambar and what is the name of its author. It is possible that 'Gandhasti' here refers to Samantabhadra's Gandhasti Maha-bhashya, as indicated by Pandit Jawaharlal Shastri in the language commentary of the text.
1 This is a commentary on the 'Anyayogavyavachched-Dvatrimshika' written by Hemchandracharya, which was completed by Mallishena Suri in Saka Samvat 1214 (Vikram Samvat) 1349.

It could be a text of the Śvetāmbaras, which is more likely given the context of the mention. Because both sects have many texts with the same name, and this similarity of names is found among Hindus and Buddhists as well. Therefore, this mere mention of the name does not lead to any specific identification.

(6) In the 'Nyāyadīpikā', Ācārya Dharmabhūṣaṇa quotes many verses from the 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā' in many places. But in one place, while proving the omniscience of the Jina, he quotes the verse 'Sūkṣmāntarita-dūrārthāḥ' with the following sentence:

"Tadu-ktaṃ
Svāmi-bhiḥ Mahābhāṣyasya Ādāv Āpta-mīmāṃsā-prastāve - "

This sentence reveals that the 'Mahābhāṣya' has a 'prastāva' - a chapter - called 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā' at the beginning. This is not unusual; an author can quote from many texts if he finds them useful in his own work. But this does not reveal that the 'Mahābhāṣya' is a commentary on Umāsvāti's 'Tattvārtha-sūtra'. It could also be a commentary on the 'Karma-prābhūta' named principle-science, and it is not impossible for it to have a chapter called 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā-prastāve'. The word 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā' in the phrase 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā-prastāve' could refer to the entire 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā' of Samantabhadra. Besides this, there could be a 'deśa-pariccheda' named 'Āpta-mīmāṃsā'.

1 This text was completed in Śaka Samvat 1307 (Vikrama Samvat 1442) and its author Dharmabhūṣaṇa is called 'Abhinava Dharmabhūṣaṇa'.

If the *Dātmaka* text is considered, then it is not clear from the said verse that the *Āpta-mīmāṃsā* text is the mangalācaraṇa of that bhāṣya, but rather it appears to be a chapter of it. There is a difference between being a prastāvanā-prakaraṇa and being a mangalācaraṇa. A chapter, even if it is mangalātmika, is not called a mangalācaraṇa in the language of the commentators. The mangalācaraṇa of the commentators, taking the praise of their chosen deity, etc., is either namaskārātmika or āśīrvādātmika, and sometimes it also includes a pledge to comment; or it is only for the pledge to comment with the praise, contemplation, etc., of the chosen deity; but it is not seen to be divided into many sections in the form of a text. There is not a single verse in the *Āpta-mīmāṃsā* that is namaskārātmika or āśīrvādātmika, or that takes the pledge to comment with the praise, contemplation, etc., of the chosen deity; it is not clear from the last verse of it that it is the mangalācaraṇa of any text, and it has already been stated that the division of the ten chapters in it is done by Samantabhadra himself. In such a situation, it does not appear that the *Āpta-mīmāṃsā* is the original mangalācaraṇa of the *Gandhasthimahābhāṣya*—that is, the bhāṣya begins with the verse 'देवागमनभोयानचामरादिविभूतयः । मायाविष्वपि - दृश्यं ते नातस्त्वमसि नो महान् ॥', and there is no other mangal verse or sentence before it. It is possible that Samantabhadra may have praised the qualities of the *āpta* in the beginning of the *Mahābhāṣya* and then composed a chapter called *Āpta-mīmāṃsā* to examine those qualities or to inform about his faith and knowledge of those qualities, etc., or he may have already composed

It is possible that the author of this text has quoted from another text. It is also possible that they have adopted the mangalacharan (invocation) of the original text as the mangalacharan of their own text. For example, some scholars believe that Pujyapada adopted the mangalacharan of the Tattvarthasutra as the mangalacharan of his commentary, "Sarvarthasiddhi," and did not create a new mangalacharan for his commentary. In both cases, it is clear that there is another mangalacharan - the "Aaptastavan" - before the "Aaptamimamsa" section, and this is more likely.

(7)  Lghusamantabhadra wrote a commentary called "Vishamapadatatparyatika" on the "Astasahastree" commentary of the "Aaptamimamsa" (Devagam). The first sentence of its introduction is as follows:

* However, many scholars disagree with this view, as will be seen later.

1. Dr. Satishchandra, in his "History of Indian Logic," writes that Lghusamantabhadra was a scholar around 1000 CE (1057 VS). However, there is no reason to believe this is correct, because Lghusamantabhadra mentions Vasunandin Acharya and his Devagamvrittika in his commentary on the word "kechit" at the end of the Astasahastree. For example, "Vasunandin Acharya: kechitshaden grahyah, yatastaireva svaya vrsyante likito'yam slokah" etc. And Vasunandin Acharya lived at the end of the 12th century Vikram era, so it is clear that Lghusamantabhadra did not live before the 13th century Vikram era. Considering what is mentioned about "chik (lghusamantabhadra)" on page 6 of the introduction to the Ratnakarandika Shravakachar, he appears to be a scholar of the 14th century Vikram era. If he is not the same as "Maghanandi" and is not a disciple of Amarakirti, then he could be a scholar of the 13th century Vikram era at the most.

_"Indeed, in the past, the venerable Bhagavats, Uma Swami, having assimilated the greatness of the Sutra-creating Maharshis, the ten predecessors of the Ganadharas, each a Buddha, a Shruta Kevali, with their impeccable knowledge and restraint, composed the great commentary, Gandhasti, on the Tattvarthaadhigama, the Moksha Shastra, as instructed by the Acharya. The great teacher of the Syadvada Vidya, Shri Swami Samantabhadra Acharya, while composing this, included a praiseworthy examination of the supreme qualities of the Paramatma, as a prelude to the composition, and thus created the Pravachana Tirtha, known as Devagama."_

This sentence, excluding the epithets of the Acharyas, specifically indicates that Swami Samantabhadra wrote a great commentary called Gandhasti on Uma Swami's Tattvarthaadhigama-Moksha Shastra, and while composing it, he created the Pravachana Tirtha called Devagama, on the occasion of examining the supreme qualities of the Paramatma. Although this mention does not reveal the number of verses in the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya, nor is it found that Devagama (Aapta Mimamsa) is its Mangalacharan, it is quite clear that Samantabhadra's Gandhasti Maha Bhashya is written on Uma Swami's Tattvartha Sutra and Devagama is also a chapter of it. As far as we understand, this is the first clear mention of this subject that has been available so far. But this mention is from which

There is no information available about the basis on which this work is based. In Jain literature before the 13th century Vikram era, the name "Gandhasthimahabhashya" has not been found, nor is there any clear statement on this subject in the "Ashta Sahasri" commentary on which this commentary is written. The preface of the Ashta Sahasri only reveals that this Aapta Mimamsa was written to support or clarify the meaning of the praise of the Aapta (liberated soul) made at the beginning of a certain Nisshreya Shastra (scripture of liberation).  

The final part of the Ashta Sahasri reveals that the "Nisshreya Shastra" refers to the scripture that begins with the praise of the Aapta in the form of "Mokshamargapraneta, Karmabhubhrudbhatta, and Vishvatattvanam Jnata". The famous verse praising the Aapta with these epithets is as follows:

> Mokshamargasya Netaram Bhettaram Karmabhubhritam |
> Jnataram Vishvatattvanam Vande Tadgunalabdhye ||

Taking this praise of the Aapta, Shri Vidyānanda Āchārya, the author of the Ashta Sahasri, has written a book called "Aapta Pariksha" on it, and himself...

He has also written a commentary. In this text, through examination, he establishes the Arhantdeva as unique and worthy of worship with these epithets, and in the 120th verse, he gives the phrase "iti sankṣepato'nvayaḥ" and in its commentary, he writes:
"iti sankṣepataḥ śāstrādāu parameṣṭhiguṇastotra-sya munipungavai-vidhīyamānasyān-vayaḥ sampradāyā-vyavacchedalakṣaṇo padārtha-ghaṭanālakṣaṇo vā lakṣaṇīyaḥ prapancatas-tad-anvayasyākṣepa-samādhānalakṣaṇasya śrīmat-svāmī-samantabhadra-devāgamākhyāpta-mīmāṃsāyāṁ prakāśanāt...."
From all this statement, it becomes clear that Samantabhadra's Āpta-mīmāṃsā text called Devāgama is written about the nature of the Āpta as mentioned in the verse "mokṣamārgasya netāram". However, it is not yet clear which Niḥśreyasa (Moksha) scripture this verse belongs to and who its author is. Vidyānanda Ācārya, concluding the Āpta-parīkṣā, writes about this:
śrīmat-tattvārtha-śāstrad-bhutasalila-nidher-iddharatnod-bhavasya, prottānā-rāmbhakāle sakala-malabhide śāstra-kāraiḥ kṛtaṁ yat. stotraṁ tīrthopamānaṁ prathita-pṛthupathaṁ svāmī-mīmāṃsitaṁ tat, vidyānandaīḥ sva-śaktyā katham-api kathitaṁ satyavākya-ārtha-siddhyai 123
This verse only reveals that the aforementioned tīrthopamāna stotra, which Swami Samantabhadra has commented on and Vidyānanda has examined, was composed by the scripture authors at the time of the beginning of the rise - the elevation or enhancement - of the Tattvārthaśāstra, which is like a vast ocean of wonders. However, it is not clear who these scripture authors are. Vidyānanda, in the commentary of Āpta-parīkṣā, has referred to the scripture authors as sūtra-kāra and has written the aforementioned guṇastotra composed by those same munipungava, but their...

The name is not given. It is possible that you are referring to 'Sutrakara' ★ 'Umasvati' Maharaj; because in many places you have quoted the words of Umasvati under the name of Sutrakara, but only from the words 'Sutrakara' or 'Shastrakara' - both of which are synonymous - the name of Umasvati does not emerge; because there have been many other Acharyas who have been Sutrakara or Shastrakara; Samantabhadra was also a Shastrakara, and his Devagamadi texts are called Sutra texts. Besides this, it is still under debate whether the above-mentioned 'Mokshamargasya Netaram' is the Mangalacharan of Umasvati's Tattvarth Sutra. Many scholars consider it to be the Mangalacharan of Umasvati's Tattvarth Sutra; and previous commentators like Balachandra, Yogadev and Shruta Sagar have also stated the same in their respective commentaries. But many other scholars do not agree, they accept it as the Mangalacharan of the ancient commentary on Tattvarth Sutra 'Sarvarth Siddhi' and state that if this verse was the Mangalacharan of Tattvarth Sutra, then the author of Sarvarth Siddhi commentary, Shri Pujyapada Acharya, would have definitely explained it, but he did not explain it and instead gave it as the Mangalacharan of his commentary, and therefore it seems to be by Pujyapada. In the introduction of Sarvarth Siddhi, Pandit Kalappa Bharmappa Nitave, opposing the statement of Shruta Sagar, expresses his own opinion, and also gives a reason that the composition of Tattvarth Sutra is by Dvaipayaka,
"

It seems inappropriate to include a mangalacharan in the middle of a question and answer; secondly, the objects of inquiry have also been considered auspicious, which is automatically established by the answer, and therefore it does not seem appropriate to perform a mangalacharan separately in such a situation. The introductory sentences are as follows:
"The verse 'Mokshamargasya Netaram' occurs at the beginning of the Sarvarthasiddhi text. It is understood from the commentary called Shruta Sagar, written by Shruta Sagaracharya, that this verse was composed by the Sutrakar Bhagavad Uma Swami. However, since it was not explained by Srimat Pujyapada Acharya, this verse was not composed by him, but by the author of Sarvarthasiddhi. It is undisputed that these sutras were composed by them as a question and answer to the doubts of the Dvaipayaka. And since the mangalacharan is inappropriate in the middle of the answer, and the object of inquiry is also considered auspicious, the above principle is to be understood by the wise." _ Pan. Vanshidharji, in his own edited edition of Ashta Sahasri, while introducing the authors, writes that Samantabhadra, while composing the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya, praised the Aapta in the beginning with this verse, and then composed the Aapta Mimamsa text for its examination. As follows: "Bhagavan Samantabhadra composed a commentary on the Gandhasti Maha Bhashya called Tattvarthopari, consisting of eighty-four thousand Anushtubh verses. In the beginning, he praised the Aapta with one verse, 'Mokshamargasya Netaram'. For its examination, he then composed the Aapta Mimamsa text, consisting of one hundred and fifteen verses." 

Page #323:
---------------------------
##  Introduction to the Text

Some scholars argue that the verse in question was not included by Akalankadeva in his commentary, the *Rajavartika*. They point out that neither the *Rajavartika* nor Vidyānanda's *Śloka Vārtika* commentary, two of the oldest available commentaries on the *Tattvārthasūtra*, mention the verse or its attributes. This suggests that these ancient commentators did not consider the verse to be part of the original text. Otherwise, there would be no reason to exclude such a significant verse, especially considering that it inspired works like the *Āpta Mīmāṃsā*. 

Furthermore, the *Tattvārthasūtra* published in the first volume of the *Sanātana Jain Granthamālā*, based on an ancient manuscript, lacks any introductory verse. Similarly, many editions of the *Tattvārthasūtra* published in Bombay, Benares, and other places do not include this verse. It is also absent in most handwritten copies. In some handwritten copies, the verse appears alongside the verses "त्रैकाल्यं द्रव्यषटुं" ("traikālyaṁ dravyaṣaṭuṁ") and "उज्जोवणमुजवणं" ("ujjovaṇamujavaṇaṁ"), or with one of these verses. This suggests that the verse is not from the original author but rather a later addition, perhaps included as an introductory verse. 

Moreover, the version of the *Tattvārthasūtra* prevalent in the Śvetāmbara sect does not contain this or any other introductory verse. 

In light of these facts, the statement attributed to Laghusamantbhadra regarding the *Aṣṭasahasrī* text does not seem to have a clear basis. Even if we assume that Vidyānanda attributed the authorship of the *Tattvārthasūtra* to Umāsvāti, the author of the *Tattvārthasūtra*,

Swami Samantabhadra.
The 'Tattvarthaadhigamamokshashastra' of his 'Tattvarthashastra' has been mentioned and therefore the said verse has been considered as the mangalacharan of the Tattvarthaadhigamasutra, then from this the result of the said statements of AshtaSahasri and AaptaPariksha is only this that Samantabhadra has composed the 'AaptaMimamsa' treatise on the said verse of Umaswati in the same way as Vidyānanda has written the 'AaptaPariksha' - or say that just as the creation of 'Aataparīkshā' was not done while writing the ShlokaVaartika Bhashya and it is not a part of ShlokaVaartika, the same situation can be in the case of 'AaptaMimamsa' in relation to Gandhasti Mahabhashya, there is no obstacle from the said words of AshtaSahasri or AaptaPariksha; * and it does not follow from them that the 'AaptaMimamsa' was created while composing the Mahabhashya on the entire Tattvarth Sutra and therefore it is a part of it. Yes, if it can be assumed in some way that the 'AaptaPariksha' refers to Samantabhadra in the said 123rd verse and therefore the mangalacharan's praise verse (stotra) is composed by him, then the meaning of 'Tattvarthashastra' can be taken from the word 'proththan' of the said verse while doing Umaswati's Tattvarth Sutra; because the proththan of Tattvarth Sutra - raising it or increasing it - is done only by treatises like Mahabhashya. And the meaning of 'proththan'
  * There is no obstacle from the following sentence of 'Samantabhadra-Bharati-Stotra', in which Samantabhadra's Bharati (AaptaMimamsa) has been symbolically told as 'taken for the meaning of the excellent mangal said by Grdhrapichchaacharya'
"Grdhrapichcha-bhashit-prakrushta-mangal-arthikaam."

##  Introduction to the Text

237

If we take the 'Uttanika' of the text, which is sometimes written at the beginning to explain the relationship of the text's creation, etc., even then there is no obstacle to the aforementioned meaning; rather, it becomes even clearer that the 'Bhashyakar' has been called the 'Shastrakar'; because there is no such Uttanika in the original Tattvarth Sutra, it is either found in the 'Sarvarth Siddhi' after the Mangalacharan or it will be in the Mahabhashya. The author of the Sarvarth Siddhi commentary can also be considered to be the 'Shastrakar' in some way. As for calling the Bhashyakar the Shastrakar, there seems to be no contradiction in this - since the Tattvarth Sutra is the meaning of the Tattvarth Shastra, when its Vartika Bhashya or explanation is also called 'Shastra', then the creators of those Vartika-Bhashya, etc., are themselves proven to be 'Shastrakar', there can be no objection to that.

And if, due to the emergence of the Tattvarth Shastra-like ocean through the Tattvarth Sutra of Umaswati, the word 'Prottan' is considered to be the aforementioned Tattvarth Sutra there, then the 'Tattvarth Shastradbhut Salilnidhi' will not remain its meaning before that, its meaning will not be a particular text but will be generally the Tattvarth Mahodadhi, Dvadashaang Shruta or some Ang-Purva, and then the statements of Ashta Sahasri and Aapta Pariksha will have the same result as was derived above - the necessary result of the creation of Gandhasti Mahabhashya will not be able to be derived from them.

* As is evident from the following statements of Vidyānanda Ācārya in the 'Shloka Vartika':

"Prasiddha cha Tattvarthasyā Shastratvē tadvartikasyā Shastrasvam Siddhamēva tadarthtvāt. .........tadēna tayākyānasyā Shastravam Nivēditam ||"

Swami Samantabhadra. Besides this, there is no specific indication in the literature or context of Aapta-Mimamsa that the verse in question is being followed or adopted as a basis for thought, just as it is not clear from the introduction or the preface of the "Vasunandi-Vritti" that Aapta-Mimamsa was written with the auspicious verse (Mokshamargasya Netaramyaadi) in mind. It is found to be somewhat different from the introduction of the Ashta-Sahasri and it is clear from this that Samantabhadra himself is sitting to praise the omniscient Lord - not to support or explain someone else's praise. He has seen the omniscient Lord through his mental perception and requested him, "O Bhagavan, the excessive narration of greatness is called praise and your greatness is beyond the senses and not the subject of my perception, so how can I praise you?" When the Lord replied, "O Vatsa, just as other scholars understand my greatness due to the arrival of gods and their movement in the sky, why don't you do the same?" Samantabhadra then said, "Bhagavan, you do not become great to me due to this reason - I do not consider you worthy of worship due to the arrival of gods and their movement in the sky - because this reason is contradictory," and saying this, he 
1. The words from the introduction of the Ashta-Sahasri, which are quoted in the footnote, show that the praise of the Aapta in the auspicious verse given at the beginning of the Nisshreya-Shastra is done through extraordinary qualities; as if the Aapta Bhagavan has asked Samantabhadra, "I am great because of the divine arrival and other powers, so why didn't the sage who wrote the Nisshreya-Shastra praise me by showing such extraordinary qualities?" In response, Samantabhadra has said the first verse of Aapta-Mimamsa. 

Page #327:
---------------------------
##  **Text Introduction**

The first verse of the *Aapta-Mimamsa* reveals its purpose, which is to demonstrate the *vyabhicara* (inconsistency) of the *Aaptas* (Jain authorities). The author uses numerous arguments and alternatives to examine the *Aaptas* throughout the text. 

The preface of the *Vrttika* by Vasunandi contains the following statements:

“
Srimat Samantabhadracharya, desiring to praise the virtues of the omniscient, having seen the collection of his own devotion, and with the purpose of demonstrating the characteristics of the cause, said: “O Bhattaraka, praise is the statement of the greatness of something. Your greatness is beyond the senses and beyond my perception. Therefore, how can I praise you?” 

Then the Lord said: “Just as others praise me based on the reasons of the divine scriptures, etc., why don’t you do the same?” 

Then he said: “You are not great towards me because of this reason. Because of the inconsistency of this reason.” Thus, he demonstrates the inconsistency.
""

Therefore, the clear statement of Laghu Samantabhadra does not seem to have any support from ancient literature. It is very likely that he drew this conclusion from the statements of the *Astasahastree* and *Aapta-Pariksha* based on traditional narratives. It is also possible that he was able to mention or draw a conclusion about the *Gandhasti Maha-Bhashya* based on the explicit mention of another text that is not yet available. 

In both cases, further research is needed to support the statement and reach a definitive conclusion based on ancient literature. Scholars should strive to do this.

These are all the references that have been available to us so far regarding this text. And the point that is found in as many parts as possible from each reference has been considered above as far as possible. In our opinion, it is definitely known from all these references that a text called 'Gandhasti-Mahabhashya' was definitely written, it was also called 'Samantabhadra-Mahabhashya' and it is possible that it was also mentioned by the name 'pure Gandhasti'. But on which text it was written - is it different from or identical to the commentary of Karmapraabhat - cannot be said with certainty yet. Yes, there is definitely a greater possibility of it being written on Umaswati's 'Tattvarth Sutra' but in such a situation, it seems to have been destroyed before Akalankdev, the author of Ashtshati and Rajavartika. The references to the Mahabhashya that are found explicitly or implicitly in the texts of previous writers do not seem to be references made by seeing the Mahabhashya itself - but rather they seem to have been made on the basis of traditional statements or from references to other ancient texts that are not yet available. There is not a single such reference in which, apart from the verses of the famous text 'Devagam', any sentence of the Mahabhashya has been quoted along with its name. Apart from this, the fact that 'Devagam' is the original mangalacharan of the said Mahabhashya is not found from these references. Yes, it could definitely be a chapter of it; but its composition took place at the time of the composition of 'Gandhasti'.
1 Samantabhadra's commentary written on the principle of 'Karmapraabhrut' is also not available. If it were in front of us, it could have helped a lot in the special decision of Gandhasti Mahabhashya. 

Page #329:
---------------------------
## Introduction to the Text

241

Whether this was already composed and later included in the Maha-bhashya, no decision has been reached yet. However, it is clear and there seems to be no objection in saying that 'Devagam (Aapta-Mimamsa)' was so famous as a completely independent text that even while revealing the Maha-bhashya as Samantabhadra's work, it was sometimes considered necessary to mention Devagam as a separate work. In this way, while proclaiming the primacy and independence of 'Devagam', it was also indicated that the mention of Gandhasti Maha-bhashya is not sufficient for the introduction of Devagam, and Devagam cannot be understood from its name alone. 

Furthermore, it can also be said that if 'Devagam' is a chapter of Gandhasti Maha-bhashya, then the 'Yukti-anusasan' text should also be a chapter after it; because in the first introductory sentence of the Yukti-anusasan commentary, Sri Vidyānanda Acharya indicates that this text was composed after the examination of the Aapta through Aapta-Mimamsa, and the word 'ach' in the first verse of the text 
1 The first introductory sentence of the commentary is as follows:
"Sri Samantabhadra Swami, having established the other yogas in Aapta-Mimamsa, asked the Bhagavan Srimat Ahata-antyati-rthakara Paramdeva, "What do you wish to do?" as if asking a question." ... 2 The first verse of Yukti-anusasan is as follows:
"With great fame, we wish to praise the growing, growing, praiseworthy, the hero, who has broken the bonds of the fetters of faults, today."
3 Today, at the time of the end of the examination (-iti Vidyānanda) ... that is, at this time - at the time of the end of the examination - we want to make you - the hero Vardhamana - the subject of our praise - we want to praise you.

It is also heard from others that before this, another text or treatise was composed. In such a situation, it does not seem inappropriate to call that "Granthraj" as "Gandhasti", whose "Devagam" and "Yuktyanusasan" are like precious original texts of great glory. It is not known then, how many such precious texts would be included in that Maha-bhashya. Its disappearance is undoubtedly a great misfortune for the Jain community.

Regarding the Mangalacharan of Maha-bhashya, although no definite opinion can be given in this matter, yet there is definitely a possibility of the verse "Mokshamargasya Netaram" being the Mangalacharan. And there is also a greater possibility that it is composed by Samantabhadra. But it is also possible - although its possibility is less - that the said verse is the Mangalacharan of Umashwatik's Tattvarth Sutra and Samantabhadra accepted it as the initial Mangalacharan of Maha-bhashya. In such a situation, there is a need for a proper solution to all the objections that are made when this verse is considered as the Mangalacharan of Tattvarth Sutra and which have been shown above. In our opinion, to consider all these things and to get a good decision about all of them, there seems to be a further need to explore the ancient Jain literature in relation to Maha-bhashya. And that need increases even more when we see that all the mentions above are from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries of Vikram era. Before that,
1 See those footnotes of the mentions in which the time of their authors is given.

There is not a single mention within a thousand years, and this time cannot be so insignificant as to be disregarded; rather, the existence, propagation, and mention of the *Mahabhashya* are more likely to have occurred during this time, and this seems more appropriate for them. Therefore, there is a special need to thoroughly examine the ancient Jain literature from the 12th century to the 3rd century to properly establish the chain and consistency of previous mentions with the first mentions; if this is done, the chain and consistency of these previous mentions will be properly established and they will become even more weighty.  Furthermore, this search is expected to reveal some other texts and biographies of Samantabhadra that could not be included in this history, and the discovery of which could further enhance the history of Samantabhadra. It is hoped that lovers of archaeology and scholars who wish to restore the history of Samantabhadra will surely make a good effort in this search and thus be able to resolve some controversial issues soon. Scholars who, through their diligence and experience in this subject, will suggest something new to us or who will take the trouble to shed light on any point included in the history in a reasoned manner, will be deserving of our special thanks, and an attempt will be made to give their point a proper place in the next edition.  Thus, auspicious.

Appendix.

In the chapter titled "Time-Determination" in the history, we have come to know some new facts about several topics discussed therein, which we deem it appropriate and necessary to present here for the benefit of the readers' experience and to aid their thoughts on the subject. Therefore, through this appendix, an attempt is made below:

(1) It is known from Vibudha Shridhar's "Shrutavatar" * that Kundakunda Acharya did not write any commentary on the first three sections of the "Shatkhandagama"; the commentary or "Parikarma" named by Indranandi in his "Shrutavatar" as containing 12,000 verses (History pp. 160, 161, 163 footnote no. 181) is the work of his disciple "Kundakirti". As:

"Thus, following the tradition of the Suras, the two doctrines, having gone to Muni Indra Kundakunda Acharya, having known the doctrine, Kundakirti will make a treatise called Parikarma, containing twelve thousand verses, on the first three sections of the Shatkhandas."

However, this mention certainly reveals that the "Shatkhandagama" was composed before Kundakunda. He, following the tradition of the Acharyas, 
* This "Shrutavatar" is a chapter (fourth section) of Vibudha Shridhar's treatise "Panchaadhikār" and has been published in the 21st volume of the Manikchand-Granthamala, "Siddhantasaraadisangrah". 

Page #333:

Samantbhadra Swami.
245
He was knowledgeable in the six-part Agamas, starting with Karma, and the principles starting with Kshaya, and therefore, scholars like Dharasen, Pushpadant, Bhutbali, and Gunadhara, who were instrumental in the creation of these principles, should be considered scholars who came before him.
(2) Vibudha Shridhar did not consider Tumbuluracharya as the commentator of the six-part Agamas and other principle texts. In his Shrutavatar, he has stated that after Kundakirti, it was Shyamakund, after Shyamakund, it was Samantbhadra, and after Samantbhadra, it was Vappdev who were the commentators. As follows:
"Shyamakund, the Bhattaraka, will write a book called 'Paddhati' in all languages, containing twelve thousand verses, without the sixth part. He will also write a commentary on the sixth part, containing seven thousand verses. Samantbhadra, the Muni Indra, will be the one to extract the two types of principles. He will also write a commentary on the six-part and five-part Agamas in Sanskrit, containing sixty-eight thousand verses. Muni Sudharma will write a commentary on the second principle, as there is no purity in the substance, etc. Having heard and known about these two types of principles from Shubhanandi Bhattaraka Parsva, Muni Indra, named Vappdev, will write a commentary in Prakrit, containing eight thousand verses."
On page 192 of the history, according to other scholars, considering Tumbuluracharya and Shrivardhadeva as one person, it is stated that:
1. The word 'Adi' refers to the four Acharyas, starting with Nagahasti, mentioned here. Out of these, the name of 'Aryamanksu' is not mentioned in this 'Shrutavatar'. The third, 'Yativrishabha', is mentioned as 'Yatinayak', and the fourth, Uccaranacharya, is mentioned as 'Samudharan' Muni. 

Page #334:
---------------------------
246
Appendix.
It was said that Indranandika in his 'Shrutavatar' stated that 'it is not right to mention the scholars after Samantabhadra's Tumbuluracharya'. This statement receives a lot of nourishment from this mention. And Indranandika's said mention (E. p. 190) becomes very doubtful. But if we accept Tumbuluracharya as a separate person from Shrivardhadeva, which doesn't seem to have any obstacle till now, then Indranandika's mention remains as a particular opinion; and therefore, there is a need to investigate whether Tumbuluracharya and Shrivardhadeva were actually one person or two different persons.
Vibudha Shridhar has mentioned the number of verses in Samantabhadra's Siddhanta-tika as 68,000, which is different from Indranandika's statement (48,000). This is absolutely clear from the above mention - 'Ashta-shashti-sahasra-pramita' word. There is no need to say anything about this.
(3) From Vibudha Shridhar's 'Shrutavatar', it is also known that Muni named Bhootbali was earlier a king named 'Narvahan' and Muni Pushpadanta was a Seth named 'Subuddhi' of his Vasundhara city. Seeing his friend become a Muni, Narvahan took the Jain initiation along with Seth Subuddhi. Both of them went to Dharasenacharya to listen to the explanation of the scriptures. After listening to it, they became famous by the names 'Bhootbali' and 'Pushpadanta'. Bhootbali composed 'Shatkhandagam' and Muni Pushpadanta became the author of 'Vimshati-prarupana'. As
1. There is no information available anywhere about the names of these two Acharyas at the time of their initiation before this fame.

Dharasen Bhattaraka will complete the reading, listening, and contemplation of Naravahana and Subuddhi on the Ashadh Shweta Ekadashi. On one night, they will perform the Bali Vidhi, and on the other, the beautiful Danta Chatushk. Due to the influence of the Bhuta Bali, Naravahana Muni will be known as Bhuta Bali, and due to the influence of the beautiful Danta Chatushk, Subuddhi will be known as Pushpadanta Muni. ............ Just as the Shatkhandagama was composed by Bhuta Bali Bhattaraka, similarly, Pushpadanta was the author of twenty Prarupaanas.'

We do not want to dwell on this narrative, but only want to point out that, although, there is no mention of a king named Naravahana in the main texts of ancient Indian history, such as 'Early History of India', his name is found in two ancient texts of the Digambar sect - 'Trilokprajnapti' (Tiloy-Pannatti) and 'Harivansh Purana' (written by Jinsen). Also, from the preface of the Harivansh Purana written by Shrinagendra Nath Basu, it is known that the Swetambar sect's texts 'Titthuguliya-Payanna' and 'Tirthoddhar Prakirna' also mention a king named Naravahana.

Swami Samantabhadra. Mention is found and he is also written as 'Narsen'. Both the sects' texts mention the reign of Narvahan as 40 years, but there is some difference in their starting and ending times. According to Digambar texts, the reign of Narvahan started 445 (60+155+40+30+60+100) years after Veer Nirvana and ended in Veer Ni. Sa. 485, and according to the statement of Shwetambar texts (as mentioned by Nageendranath Basu), it started 413 (60+155+108+30+60) years after Veer Nirvana and ended in Veer Ni. Sa. 453. Thus, there is a total difference of 32 years between the two. But let this difference remain and see that, if indeed this king Narvahan, becoming Bhootbali Muni, has composed the 'Shatkhandagam' named Siddhant Granth and this time of his (one of the two) is correct, then we have to say that the said Siddhant Granth was composed at that time when the eleven Angas of Ekadasang Shruta - the Paathi Mahamunis were present* and in whose presence there was no fear of the severance of 'Karmapraabhrut' Shruta. In such a situation, taking into account the said fear, the story of the incarnation of 'Shatkhandagam' Shruta, which Indranandi Acharya has written in his 'Shrutavatar', seems to be largely fabricated. According to him, Bhootbali Acharya happened many years after Veer Nirvana Sa. 683 and there is a huge difference of about 200 years between these two times. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the said statement of Vibudh Shridhar in particular and scholars should investigate this new...

* The existence of these Ekadasang Paathi Mahamunis, according to ancient texts like Trilokpragyapti, has been till 565 years after Veer Nirvana.

It is necessary to find out the special details about the existence of Han Raja. There are many other things in this Shrutavatar of Vibudhshridhar which are different from the Shrutavatar of Indranandi.
Here, we consider it appropriate to reveal that in his article written on 'Trilokprajnapti', Shriyut Pandit Nathuramji Premi has indicated Narvahan as the 'Nahapana' king. But we have not been able to find out on what basis he has indicated this, even after trying to know it, and we have not been able to find any sufficient evidence of the unity of the two ourselves. So be it. There is no doubt that Nahapana has become a historically famous Kshatrapa king and many of his coins are also found. Mr. Vincent Smith, in his 'Early History of India', has described Nahapana as the king of the period between about 60 and 90 AD, and Pandit Vishweshwar-Nathji, in 'Bharat ke Prachin Rajvansh', describes him as the king of the first half of the first century AD. An inscription of Nahapana's son-in-law Ushavadat (Rishabhadat) has also been found, dated Saka 42, which sheds light on Nahapana's time. It is possible that Nahapana and Narvahan are the same person, but if this is assumed, then the time given for Narvahan in Trilokprajnapti etc. will either have to be considered wrong or it will have to be accepted that 'Trilok

The main mention in the 'Prajnapti' that it was written 461 years after the Nirvan of Shak Raja is probably correct and should be understood as the time of the end of the reign of Shak Raja. However, for a thorough investigation and a true decision, special research is needed, which should be the endeavor of scholars.

(4) In a recent article*, Dr. Hermann Jacobi has written that 'Siddhasen Divakara' was a scholar of the 7th century AD or should be considered to be from that time - because he was familiar with the logic of the Buddhist philosopher 'Dharmakirti':

"...The first Svetambara author of Sanskrit works which have come down to us was Siddhasen Divakara who must be assigned to the 7th century A.D. since he was acquainted with the logics of the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti.”

Although Dr. Jacobi has not provided any clear explanation of his statement, his reasoning suggests that he has specifically examined the 'Nyayavtar' text of Siddhasen Divakara. And he has reached this conclusion based on an internal examination of the literature with the texts of Dharmakirti. If this conclusion of his is indeed true, 

* This article was published in the fortnightly journal 'Veer' of the Jain Council (No. 11-12) in the 'Mahavira Jayanti Issue'.

It is correct - then there can be no objection to saying that Siddhasena Divakara, considering him to be a scholar named 'Kshapanaka' from the nine gems of Vikramaditya's court and contemporary of Varahamihira, who has been shown to be a scholar of the sixth and fifth centuries AD, or
x We could not investigate this matter due to the absence of Dharma Kirti's 'Nyaya Bindu' etc. It is possible that the characteristics of direct and inferential evidence given in 'Nyaya Avatara' were also written with the characteristics of Dharma Kirti in mind. 'Pratyaksha Kalpanapoddham Abrant' this is the characteristic of 'Pratyaksha' is famous for Dharma Kirti. In the fourth verse of Nyaya Avatara, the characteristic of Pratyaksha, unlike Akalankadeva, is not given as 'Pratyaksha Vishadam Gnanam', but rather 'Aporoksha Tayarthasya Grahakam Gnanam Idrisham Pratyaksha', and in the next verse, while giving the characteristic of inference, 'Tadabrant Pramanatvat Samakshavat' by the phrase, it (Pratyaksha) is also indicated as being characterized by the adjective 'Abrant', from which such a sound definitely emerges or the possibility is found that Dharma Kirti's said characteristic was also present in front of Siddhasena - in his target - and he, in his characteristic, by using the word 'Grahak', has shown Pratyaksha to be a decisive knowledge, thus negating or piercing Dharma Kirti's adjective 'Kalpanapoddham' and, at the same time, has accepted his adjective 'Abrant' in a different way. The commentators of Nyaya Avatara also point out that the said characteristic of the Buddhists (Dharma Kirti) is negated by the word 'Grahak'. As

Similarly, 'Trirupal Lingato Lingijnanam Anumanam' this is the characteristic of Dharma Kirti's inference. In this, by the word 'Trirupat', the linga is shown to be trirupaatmaka, giving a special form to the general characteristic of inference. It is possible that keeping this in mind, Siddhasena has given the 'Sadhyavina -

It is not entirely accurate to call him a scholar of the first century of the Vikram era. It must also be said that if there was a scholar named 'Kshapanaka' who was a contemporary of Varahamihira or Kalidasa, then he must have been a different scholar than this Siddhasena Divakara. And there can be no doubt that the scholar Sri Pujyapada Acharya of the fifth century AD, in the following sutra of his 'Jainendra' grammar, has mentioned 'Siddhasena', who must have been a different Siddhasena:
Vetteh Siddhasenasyah || 5-1-7 || _ It is not surprising that these are different Siddhasenas, whose mention is found in Digambara texts and whose brief introduction has been given on pages 138-139. In Digambara texts, Siddhasena is not mentioned by the name 'Siddhasena Divakara'; in such a situation, there will be a special need to investigate which of the texts available under the name Siddhasena belong to which Siddhasena. It is hoped that the learned doctor will be kind enough to clarify his purpose and other scholars will also pay attention to the research of this important subject.
'Bhunolingaatsadhyanishchayakamanumanam' may have been the formulation of this characteristic and in it, by giving the form of 'Sadhyavinaabhavi' to the linga, he may have preferred to distort the three forms of Dharma Kirti. Whatever may be the case, we do not want to say anything definitively about this subject without proper investigation.

Offering obeisance to the specific deity desired, seeking the fruit of the completion of the scriptures without obstacles, etc., in the Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra, one says: —
1
'Namaha' let there be obeisance. To whom? 'Śrīvardhamānāya' to the last Tīrthankara or to the assembly of Tīrthankaras. How? 'Ava-samantādṛddhaṁ paramātiśaya-prāptaṁ mānaṁ kevalajñānaṁ yasya asau vardhamānaḥ'. 'Avāpyorallopaḥ' by the rule of the elision of the 'ava' sound. 'Śrīyā bahirangayā'ntarangayā ca samavaśaraṇānantyacatuṣṭayalakṣaṇayopa-lakṣito vardhamānaḥ śrīvardhamāna iti vyutpatteḥ tasmai kathāmbhūtāya? 'Nirdhūtakalilātmane' nirdhūtaṁ sphōṭitaṁ kalilaṁ jñānāvaraṇādirūpaṁ pāpaṁ ātmana ātmānāṁ ca abhavyajīvānāṁ yenāsau nirdhūtakalilātma tasmai. Yasyā vidyā kevala-jñānalakṣaṇā kiṁ karoti? 'Darpaṇāyate' acts like a mirror. Of whom? 'Trilokānāṁ' of the three worlds. How? 'Sālokānāṁ' of those who are in the same world, including the sky. This is the meaning: just as a mirror is the illuminator of the face, etc., which is within the range of its own senses, so is this knowledge the illuminator of those who are in the same world, the three worlds. Here, the first half indicates the omniscience of the Lord, and the second half indicates the omniscience spoken of. ॥ 1 ॥
Then, after offering obeisance, what should one do? One says: I will explain the appropriate Dharma, the destruction of karma. From the suffering of the world, it leads one to the highest happiness. ॥ 2 ॥
'Deśayāmi' I will explain. What? 'Dharma'. How? 'Samīcīnaṁ' unobstructed, beneficial to those who practice it in this world and the next. How do you know that it is so? One says 'Karma-nibarhaṇaṁ' because Dharma is the destroyer of karma, which is the cause of the suffering of the world.

## Chapter One

Nibandhana is the destroyer, then as described, with specific qualities. Supporting this meaning through the derivation of the word, he says, "In the world..." etc. In the world, there are four kinds of suffering, physical, mental, etc. From these, "he who holds" the beings, the living creatures, and establishes them in "the highest happiness." Who is he? "The Dharma," which is called so, is the source of happiness, like heaven and liberation. ||2||

Now, he says, what are the characteristics of this Dharma? "The righteous vision, knowledge, and conduct, the Dharma Lords know. Those who have the opposite of these, they have the path of existence." ||3||

Vision is faith in the truth, knowledge is understanding the truth, and conduct is the characteristic of the cessation of sinful actions. These righteous vision, knowledge, and conduct are appropriate. This is the nature of "Dharma." "They know," they say, they explain. Who are they? "The Dharma Lords," the Jinas, the masters of the three jewels, the characteristics of Dharma, are the lords, both by practice and by explanation.

Why are these the Dharma, and not the wrong views, etc.? He says, "Those who have..." etc. Those who have the opposite of these righteous vision, etc., those who have the opposite, the wrong views, etc., they have the "path of existence," they become established in it. What is it? "The path of existence" is the path of the world. This is the meaning: because the wrong views, etc., which are the opposite of the right vision, etc., are the path of the world, therefore, the right vision, etc., are the nature of Dharma, because they are the means of achieving the happiness of heaven and liberation. ||3||

To explain the nature of the right vision, he says, "Faith in the ultimate reality, which is supported by the scriptures and the wise. The right vision, free from delusion, is eightfold, and free from wonder." ||4||

The right vision exists. What is it? "Faith," the inclination. Of whom? "Of those who are supported by the scriptures and the wise," whose nature will be explained later. It should not be thought that this faith is not included in the six substances, seven principles, and nine categories. Because, from the faith in the scriptures, the inclusion of that faith is well-known. 1. Because it is known by the means of knowledge. 2. Because it is from the faith in the scriptures.

## Ratnakaranda Shravakaachara - I

This Agama is the word of the Aapta, which clearly explains the truth.  Those who have faith in it, their faith is indeed established.  What kind of faith is this?  It is faith in the "Paramartha" - the ultimate truth, not in something imagined like a fabricated opinion.  What kind of faith is it?  It is "Asmaya" - free from the eight types of doubts, such as knowledge-pride, which will be explained later.  What else is it?  It is "Trimudhaport" - free from the three types of ignorance, which will be explained later.  It is "Ashtaanga" - having eight limbs, such as unshakeable conviction, which will be explained later. || 4 ||

Here, explaining the nature of the Aapta, as mentioned in the context of right vision, the text says:

One must be an Aapta, free from all faults, omniscient, and the master of the Agama.  There is no other way to be an Aapta. || 5 ||

"Aapta" - one must be an Aapta, "niyogena" - with certainty, or by rule.  What kind of Aapta?  "Utsannadoshena" - free from all faults.  Also, "Sarvajnena" - one must be omniscient, having complete and clear knowledge of all things, by rule.  Also, "Agameshina" - one must be the master of the Agama, the one who reveals the truth about what is to be avoided and what is to be pursued for the benefit of those who are to be liberated, by rule.  Why is this so?  The text says - "Nanyatha hyapta ta bhavet" - "hi" - because, otherwise, in the way mentioned earlier, Aaptahood would not be possible. || 5 ||

Then, wondering what those faults are, which are absent in the Aapta, the text says:

Hunger, thirst, old age, fear, birth, death, fear of the unseen, and delusion - the Aapta is free from all these. || 6 ||

"Kshutch" - hunger.  "Pipasa" - thirst.  "Jara" - old age.  "Atanka" - fear.  "Janma" - birth, arising from karma in the four realms of existence.  "Antaka" - death.  "Bhayam" - fear, characterized by the fear of the unseen, the fear of death, the fear of pain, and the fear of the unexpected.  "Smaya" - delusion, arising from caste and family...

1. The text in the book reads "Na vidyate smaya vaksya mana yatra iti adi patha kha - pustake".
2. "Kambhbutam" - what kind of.
3. "Chhi" - another reading.
4. "Niyogena" - by rule.

## First Chapter: 

**Pride.**  Raga, Dvesha, and Moha are well-known.  Ch, Chinta, Rati, Nidra, Vismaya, Manda, Sweda, and Khed are also included. These eighteen doshas are not present in an Aapta, who is declared (proclaimed) as such. 

Now, would an Aapta experience hunger? If they did, then due to the absence of activity in eating and so on, there would be no sustenance of the body. But they do exist, so there must be a way for them to obtain sustenance. 

Indeed, the sustenance of Bhagavan's body is dependent on food, just like the sustenance of our bodies.  Here, a Jain asks: Is only food sufficient, or is it Kavalaahara?  

In the first case, the Siddhasadhanata of the Aharin Jivas who are Asyogakevalin is accepted by the scriptures.  But in the second case, there is a contradiction with the sustenance of the Devas.  Since the Devas do not have Kavalaahara, their sustenance is still possible.  

Perhaps their sustenance is through Manasahara.  If so, then the sustenance of the Kevalins is through Karma-Nokarma-Aahara.  

If the sustenance of the human body is like ours, then there would be a constant absence of sweat and other such things in their body.  Even though we do not experience such an excess, it is possible for them.  Would there not be an excess in the form of the absence of eating?  

Furthermore, if the Dharma we see in us is achieved by Bhagavan, then there is a possibility that their knowledge is generated by the senses.  Indeed, Bhagavan's knowledge is sensory knowledge, just like ours.  Therefore, since Bhagavan cannot have knowledge beyond the senses, like Kevala Jnana, the offering of water to the sun (a gesture of respect) is given to the concept of omniscience.  

Even if there is no difference in the nature of knowledge, if that knowledge is beyond the senses, and even if there is no difference in the sustenance of the body, would the sustenance of their body not be dependent on Kavalaahara?  

The statement that they have the desire to eat, and therefore engage in eating, due to the existence of the object of desire, is not valid. 

Page #346:
---------------------------
## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar

**Since the object of desire (bu-bhuksha) is produced by the power of the mohaniya karma, which is an aid to the vedaniya karma, how can it be present in the one who has destroyed moha (delusion), O Bhagavan?** Otherwise, even if there is a desire for food, it would not be free from attachment due to the involvement of the service of beautiful women and the like, which is not different from the service of Ishvara. Due to the perception of the opposite, the destruction of raga (attachment) and the like is seen to be very great in the Kevalin. Therefore, even the extreme absence of food would not be present there, because the perception of the opposite is the same in the case of food. For example, on one day, a person eats many times. Due to the perception of the opposite, he eats again once. Another person eats after a day, another after a month, a year, etc. Moreover, is the enjoyment of the taste of food due to the cessation of the pain of hunger, or due to the taste buds or due to Kevala Jnana? If it is due to the taste buds, then there would be no Kevala Jnana due to the involvement of mati-jnana. If it is due to Kevala Jnana, then what is the purpose of food? Because even the taste of the stomach of the three worlds can be clearly experienced by it. How can Kevala Jnana be present in one who is eating, since he has fallen from the rank of a Shreni and is in the state of a pramatta (distracted)? For even a sadhu (saint) becomes distracted by merely hearing about food, let alone one who eats. This is a great contradiction. Let us assume that Jnana is possible. Even then, how can one who sees flesh and other impure substances with Kevala Jnana eat them, because of the involvement of obstacles? Even householders who see these things with little sattva (purity) create obstacles. How much more so would Bhagavan, who has infinite power, do so? If he does not do so, then he would be inferior to them in sattva. If he experiences the pain of hunger, how can he have infinite happiness, since he is the master of the four infinites? For it is not appropriate for the infinite to have obstacles. Nor can it be said that hunger is not a pain, because it is said, "There is no pain in the body like hunger." Therefore, enough of this unnecessary discussion. This is the explanation of the lotus of the object of knowledge, the sun, in the moon of the Nyaya Kumuda.

**Now, describing the garland of names of the perfect one, free from the above-mentioned defects, he says:**

1. **A-pramatto'pi kha** (Even though he is not distracted)
2. **Sattvani kha ga** (He has sattva)
3. **Heenatva kha** (He is not inferior)

## Chapter One

The Supreme Being, the radiant one, free from attachment, pure, and perfect, is the omniscient one, without beginning, middle, or end, and beneficial to all. He is the teacher who is praised. (7)

"Parameshthi" refers to the one who resides in the highest position, worthy of being worshipped by Indra and others. "Paranjyotir" refers to the one who possesses radiant knowledge, which is supreme and free from any covering. "Virago" refers to the one who is free from attachment, which is the cause of emotions and actions. "Vimala" refers to the one who is free from impurities, whose essence, the root, and the subsequent karmic nature and its manifestations are destroyed. "Kriti" refers to the one who is wise, possessing discrimination in the matter of the complete elimination of all that is to be avoided and all that is to be attained. "Sarvajno" refers to the one who is the direct knower of all things as they truly are. "Anadimadhyanta" refers to the one who is devoid of beginning, middle, and end, in relation to the flow of the attainment of the described nature. "Sarva" refers to the one who is beneficial to all, as the guide to the path that leads to the welfare of this world and the next. "Shasta" refers to the one who is the teacher, who instructs on the true nature of all things, free from defects such as contradictions and others. These words describe the true nature of the liberated one, which is "upalalyate" - explained. (7)

Having described the nature of the liberated one, which is the subject of right faith, now the author speaks of the nature of the scriptures, which are the subject of that faith:

The teacher teaches the good of the virtuous, without any desire for personal gain. What does a drum expect when it sounds due to the touch of the drummer's hand? (8)

"Shasta" refers to the liberated one. "Shaasti" means teaches. Who does he teach? "Satah" refers to the virtuous, those who are worthy of being taught. What does he teach? "Hitam" refers to the good, which includes the means to attain heaven and the like, as well as right faith and so on. Does he teach with any desire for personal gain? The author says, "Anatmartha" - there is no personal gain for him, no purpose for himself in teaching. He teaches only for the benefit of others. This is indicated by the saying, "For the benefit of others, the virtuous strive." How do we know that he teaches in this way? The author says, "Vina ragai" - because he teaches without any attachment, which is characterized by the desire for gain, praise, and fame, it is clear that he does not teach for personal gain. To further support this meaning, the author says, "Dhvnan" and so on. The drum, "Muralo," sounds due to the touch of the drummer's hand, "Shilpikarasparshat," what does it expect? 

Page #348:
---------------------------
## Ratnakaranda Shravakaachara:

**Verse 8:**

The Ratnakaranda Shravakaachara does not seek anything for itself, nor does it seek anything for itself. This meaning is like a drum, which makes various sounds only for the benefit of others, so the omniscient one has created the scriptures.

**Verse 9:**

What kind of scripture is that which is created by him? It is said:

* **Aapta-upanya:** The first utterance of the omniscient one.
* **Anullangya:** It is not to be transgressed because it is Aapta-upanya. Therefore, it is to be followed by Indra and others. Why? Because it is Aapta-upanya, therefore it is not to be transgressed by them.
* **Adrishteishta-virodhaka:** What is seen (pratyaksha), what is desired (anumana, etc.), there is no contradiction with what is seen and desired.
* **Tattvopadeśakrit:** Why is it established? Because it is the teacher of the true nature of the sevenfold substances (jiva, etc.). It is the true teacher, therefore it is not contradictory to what is seen and desired.
* **Sarvam:** Why is it understood? Because it is beneficial to all. It is called Sarvam. How can it be established without the true representation of its nature?
* **Kaapath-ghattanam:** Why is it certain? Because it is the destroyer of the false path (kaapath), the false view, etc. The scripture created by the omniscient one is the destroyer of the false path, therefore it is Sarvam.

**Verse 10:**

Now, describing the nature of the tapasvi who is beyond the reach of faith, he says:

* **Vishayaasha-vasha-tito:** Beyond the control of desire for objects (like beautiful women, etc.).
* **Niraarambha:** Abandoning all activities (like agriculture, etc.).
* **Aparigraha:** Free from external and internal attachments.
* **Jnana-dhyana-tapo-ratna:** The jewel of knowledge, meditation, and austerity. Such a tapasvi is praiseworthy. 

Page #349:
---------------------------
## Chapter One

**10.**  The one who possesses these qualities, who is like a jewel among ascetics, is praised and lauded as a worthy teacher.

**11.**  Now, describing the nature of the unshakeable certainty of right faith, which is the subject of the scriptures and the teacher who has liberated himself, the text says: "This alone is the truth, nothing else, and not otherwise."  This unshakeable certainty of right faith is like the water in a sword, which is firm and unwavering.  

**11.**  What is the nature of this unshakeable certainty?  It is the unwavering faith in the right path, which is the path of liberation from the ocean of samsara, the path that is followed by the wise.  

**11.**  What is the nature of this unshakeable certainty?  It is the unwavering faith in the right path, which is the path of liberation from the ocean of samsara, the path that is followed by the wise.  

**12.**  Now, describing the nature of non-attachment in right faith, the text says: "In the midst of suffering, arising from the influence of karma, and ending in destruction, there is no attachment to worldly pleasures, and the faith that is free from desire is remembered."

**12.**  This non-attachment is the nature of the faith that is free from desire.  What is this faith?  It is the faith that is free from attachment to worldly pleasures, which are transient and subject to the influence of karma.  This faith is free from attachment to worldly pleasures, which are transient and subject to the influence of karma.

The Ratnakaranda Shravaka Chara, now illustrating the quality of non-doubtfulness in right faith, says: "In a body naturally impure, purified by the three jewels, there is non-disgust, delight in qualities, and non-doubtfulness." (13)

"Non-doubtfulness" is accepted. What is it? Non-disgust is the absence of doubt. Where? In the body. What is special about it? It is naturally impure, defiled by its very nature. Even in such a body, "purified by the three jewels," it is brought to reverence. Why is there no disgust in such a body? "Delight in qualities" - because there is delight in the qualities, the characteristics of liberation, which are the foundation of the three jewels. This human body is the means of liberation, not the body of a god or anything else. Therefore, there is no disgust there. (13)

Now, illuminating the quality of non-delusion in right faith, it says: "In the path of deceit, there is no agreement with the sorrows, even in the deceitful one. Non-attachment, non-praise, is called non-deluded vision." (14)

Non-deluded vision is right faith, characterized by the quality of non-delusion. What is it? "Non-agreement" - there is no agreement of the mind with the means of happiness. Where? "In the path of deceit" - in the wicked path, in false faith, etc. How? "In the path" - in the way. Of what? "Of sorrows." Not only is there no agreement there, but also "even in the deceitful one" - even in the being who is based on false faith, etc. Similarly, "non-attachment" - there is no attachment, no praise of the body with nails, hair, etc. "Non-praise" - there is no praise, no verbal commendation. Non-praise of the mind, speech, and body, of false faith, etc., and of those who hold it, is non-deluded, right faith. (14)

Now, explaining the quality of acceptance, it says: "That which is spoken by those who are pure in their own path, who are the refuge of the young and the weak, and which they accept, is called acceptance." (15)

## First Chapter

They say that **upgrahana** means to cleanse, reject, and cover. What? The fault of **vacyata**. Of whom? The **marga** (path) characterized by the three jewels. What kind of **marga**? **Self-pure** (naturally pure). How? **Dependent on the ignorant and the weak**. The ignorant, the one who is unable to perform vows, and the people who are dependent on them. This is the meaning: The covering of the fault of the three jewels or the one who possesses them, which comes from depending on people who are unable to discern right and wrong and perform vows, is called **upgrahana**. || 15 ||

Now, showing the quality of **sthitikarana** (stabilization) of right vision, he says:

> Even from the practice of vision, those who are devoted to Dharma,
> **Sthitikarana** is called by the wise as **pratyavasthapana**. || 16 ||

**Sthitikarana** is called the stabilization of the vision that has become unsteady. By whom? By the wise. What is it? **Pratyavasthapana** is the re-establishment of vision, etc., as before. Of whom? Of those who are **chalata** (wavering). From what? From the practice of vision. Who re-establishes them? Those who are **dharmavatsala** (devoted to Dharma). || 16 ||

Now, revealing the nature of the quality of **vatsalya** (affection) in vision, he says:

> Affection towards one's own group, with sincerity and devoid of deceit,
> **Pratipatti** (understanding) as appropriate is called **vatsalya**. || 17 ||

**Vatsalya** is affection for a fellow practitioner of Dharma. **Abhilpyate** means to be explained. What is it? **Pratipatti** is in the form of respect, praise, etc. How? **Yatha yogyam** (as appropriate), without exceeding the limits, in the form of bowing, approaching, praising, speaking, offering gifts, etc. Towards whom? **Swayuthyan** (one's own group), towards Jains. How? **Sadbhavasnatha** (with sincerity), meaning with sincerity and without deceit. Therefore, **apetakaitava** (devoid of deceit), meaning one who is devoid of deceit and illusion. || 17 ||

**Now, describing the nature of the quality of *Prabhavana* (Influence), the text says:**

> "By removing the darkness of ignorance completely, the brilliance of the Jina's teachings should be the *Prabhavana*." (18)

What is *Prabhavana*? It is the "brilliance of the Jina's teachings." The brilliance of the Jina's teachings is the manifestation of the extraordinary qualities of austerity, knowledge, etc. How? By following the proper procedures in matters like bathing, giving donations, worship, rituals, austerities, mantras, and tantras, etc., without any deviation from the power of the self. By doing what? By "removing" or rejecting what? The "darkness of ignorance that pervades." The ignorance of those who are not devoted to the Jina's teachings, regarding matters like bathing, giving donations, etc., is like darkness or blindness. Its pervasiveness is its spread. (18)

**Now, showing which of the eight limbs is prominent in which quality, the text says in two verses:**

> "First, Anjanachora, then Anantamati is remembered. Uddayana is considered in the third, and Revati in the fourth." (19)
> "Then, another, the devotee of the Jina, is considered in the fifth, then Varisena. Vishnu and Vajranama are considered in the remaining two." (20)

The word "taavata" indicates sequence. The eight limbs, including the unshakeable nature of right faith, are considered in these. Among them, Anjanachora is considered in the first limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith, as an example. He is considered certain. In the second limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith, Anantamati is considered after Anjanachora. In the third limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith, Uddayana is considered. In the fourth limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith, Revati is considered. Then, after these four, the devotee of the Jina is considered in the fifth limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith. Then, after the devotee of the Jina, Varisena is considered in the sixth limb, the unshakeable nature of right faith.

## Chapter One:

Vishnu and Vishnukumar, Vajra and Vajrakumar, are the objects of affection for the two (Sheshas). The use of the plural "gata" (gone) indicates the existence of multiple individuals, as exemplified by the statement itself.

13.
In this context, the story of Janachora (the thief) is presented as an example of unwavering faith.

As the story goes, Dhanvantari and Vishvaloma, blessed with virtuous deeds, were born as radiant deities, each seeking to test the other's righteousness. They arrived at a place where Yama (the god of death) and Agni (the god of fire) were present. They were moved by the austerity of a Jain ascetic named Jinadatta, a wealthy merchant, who was observed performing a fast on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Chaturdashi) in a cremation ground. Amitaprabhadeva (one of the deities) then instructed his disciples to stay away, saying, "Let my monks stay away from this householder, as he is absorbed in meditation." Despite various attempts by Vidyutprabhadeva (the other deity) to disrupt his meditation, Jinadatta remained unmoved. At dawn, Vidyutprabhadeva, using his magical powers, praised Jinadatta and bestowed upon him the knowledge of celestial flight. He also informed him, "This knowledge is now yours, and it will be yours forever, but you must worship it with five prostrations, offerings, and rituals."

Once, Jinadatta was asked by Somadatta, a flower seller, "Where are you going so early in the morning?" Jinadatta replied, "I am going to pay my respects to the unadulterated temple." He then revealed, "I have gained this knowledge." Somadatta then requested, "Please give me this knowledge so that I can accompany you and offer flowers and pay my respects." Jinadatta then instructed him. On the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, Somadatta went to the cremation ground, tied a hundred and eight blades of grass to the eastern branch of a banyan tree, placed sharp weapons with their points facing upwards beneath it, offered flowers and incense, entered the grass, and, while performing a six-day fast, chanted five prostrations. As he cut off his feet one by one with a knife, he saw a blazing fire below and, fearing death, thought, "If the words of the merchant are false, then I will die."

## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Charitra

This story tells of a thief who repeatedly steals. In this narrative, a thief named Anjanachora, seeing the beautiful Queen Kanakrajni's golden necklace, tells her, "If you give me the golden necklace, I will not harm you, otherwise..."  He then went and stole the necklace at night.  However, the guards and the Kottapala recognized him by the light of the necklace.  He was caught, but he abandoned the necklace and fled.  He saw a Vatuka (Jain monk) under a banyan tree and, without hesitation, cut off his own arm with a sword and dropped it at the monk's feet.  He then said, "Give me your order."  The monk said, "Take me to the Shreshthi Jinadatta."  He was then taken to the Sudarshana Meru Chaitya temple and brought before Jinadatta.  He narrated the entire incident and said, "Just as this Siddha has become enlightened by your teachings, please guide me to enlightenment in the next life."  He then took up austerities in the presence of the Charana Muni and attained liberation by attaining Kevala Jnana on Mount Kailash.  || 1 ||

## Anantamati's Story

This story is an example of the infinite power of non-attachment.  In Angadesha, there was a king named Vasuvaradhana and his queen Lakshmimati.  The Shreshthi Priyadatta and his wife Angavati had a daughter named Anantamati.  On the eighth day of Nandi Shravana, the Shreshthi took a vow of celibacy for eight days at the feet of Dharma Kirti Acharya.  Anantamati was also included in this vow.  One day, during the time of offering, Anantamati said, "Father, you made me take a vow of celibacy, so why are you now talking about marriage?"  The Shreshthi replied, "I made you take the vow for fun."  Anantamati said, "Father, there is no fun in Dharma and vows."  The Shreshthi said, "My daughter, the vow was only for eight days of Nandi Shravana, not forever."  Anantamati said, "But the Bhattarakas did not intend for it to be forever."  She then said, "I will not get married in this life," and she began to learn all the arts and sciences.  She was full of youth and beauty.  One day, in the month of Chaitra, while she was playing in her garden, she saw a Vidhyadhara king named Sukeishi, adorned with earrings, flying in the sky with his wife.  She thought, "How can I live without him?"  She was about to be taken away...

The story of Udayana is an example of unwavering faith. Once, while Sudharma Indra was praising the virtue of right faith in his assembly, he mentioned the unwavering faith of King Udayana of Roraka in the Vatsa country. To test him, Vasavdeva, disguised as a mendicant with leprosy, stood before him, and using his magical powers, ate all the food and water offered to him, then vomited profusely, emitting a foul odor. The king's attendants fled in fear, and the king, seeing the vomit on his queen Prabhavati, blamed himself, saying, "Alas! I have given her the wrong food!" He tried to wash her, but then, revealing his true form, Vasavdeva told him the whole story, praised him, and ascended to heaven. King Udayana, meditating at the feet of Vardhamana Swami, attained liberation. Prabhavati, through her penance, became a deity in Brahma's heaven. This story is an example of unwavering faith.

In the city of Meghakuta, in the southern part of Vijayardha, King Chandra Prabha, after giving his kingdom to his son Chandrashekhara, went to South Mathura to serve the great sage Guptacharya, carrying many medicinal herbs for his benefit and to show his devotion. He became a disciple of Guptacharya. Once, when Guptacharya was going to North Mathura to show his devotion, he was asked, "What should be said to whom?" The sage replied, "The praise of Sutrata Muni and the blessings of Queen Revati, the wife of King Varuna, should be conveyed. Even if asked three times, that is all that should be said." Then, in a small voice, he added, "It has not been said. The great sage Bhavya Sena, the holder of the eleven limbs, does not accept the names of others. There must be some reason for this." Thinking this, he went to Bhavya Sena's residence, conveyed the praise of Sutrata Muni, and witnessed the special affection he had for him. Then he went to Bhavya Sena's residence. When he arrived, Bhavya Sena did not speak to him, but took a pitcher and went outside with him. He showed him a path covered with green, tender shoots of grass, and said, "It is said that in the past... 

Page #357:
---------------------------
## Chapter One:

Having said, "The souls are being spoken of," he showed interest and went to the grass. At the time of purification, there was no water in the pitcher, and no deformity was visible. Therefore, he performed purification in a clean pond with fine clay. Knowing him to be a false-sighted one, Bhavya Sena was given the name Abhavya Sena. Then, on another day, in the eastern direction, a four-faced one, seated in the lotus posture, adorned with the sacred thread and other paraphernalia, representing Brahma, was shown. The king and others, including Bhavya Sena, went there. Revati, however, said, "Who is this Brahma-named god?" and even though urged by the people, she did not go. Similarly, in the southern direction, a four-armed one, riding Garuda, holding a mace, conch, etc., representing Vasudeva, was shown. In the western direction, a one riding a bull, adorned with a half-moon, matted hair, and a group of goddesses, representing Shankar, was shown. In the northern direction, in the middle of the assembly, a Tirthankara-deity form, surrounded by eight attendants, worshipped by gods, humans, vidyadharas, and sages, was shown. All the people went there. Revati, however, even though urged by the people, did not go. "There are only nine Vasudevas, eleven Rudras, and twenty-four Tirthankaras mentioned in the Jina Agama. They are all past. This one is a magician," she said and stayed. On another day, during the time of wandering, a man, disguised as a sickly, emaciated, and small person, fell down in a faint due to magic near the entrance of Revati's house. Hearing this, Revati, out of devotion, raised him up, performed the necessary rituals, and started to give him wholesome food. He ate all the food and vomited foul-smelling matter. "Alas! I have given him unwholesome food," said Revati. Hearing her words, they withdrew their magic, bowed to the goddess, and, after receiving the guru's blessings and narrating the previous events, praised her loudly in the midst of the people for her unclouded vision and went to their own place. King Varuna, giving the kingdom to Shiva Kartiputra, took up asceticism and became a god in the Maheindra heaven. Revati also performed asceticism and became a god in the Brahma heaven.

In the Ratnakaranda Shravaka Charitra, there is an example of a Jina devotee, a story from the Surastra country, in the city of Pataliputra. King Yashodhara, Queen Susima, and their son Suvira were overwhelmed by seven vices and were served by thieves. In the eastern country, in the Gauda region, in the city of Tamralipta, there was a Jina devotee, a wealthy merchant, who had a seven-story palace with many guards and a statue of Parsvanatha with a canopy above it. Hearing about a very special, priceless Vaidurya gem, Suvira, out of greed, asked his men if anyone could bring it. A thief named Surya, boasting that he could even steal the gem from Indra's crown, pretended to be a simpleton and, causing great trouble in villages and cities, gradually reached Tamralipta. Hearing about the gem, he went there, saw it, bowed down, spoke to the merchant, praised him, and, being agitated, the Jina devotee, taking him to Parsvanatha, made him the gem's guard by trickery, even though he was unwilling. One day, the merchant, asking the simpleton to guard the gem, went out of the city on a sea voyage. The thief, knowing the household and the time, took the gem in the middle of the night and left. The gem's brilliance was seen by the Kottapala guards on the way, and they tried to seize it. Unable to escape from them, he went to the merchant for refuge, saying, "Protect me, protect me!" Hearing the commotion of the Kottapala guards, the merchant, seeing the thief, said, "You have done a great injustice by making this great ascetic's proclamation about this gem." The Kottapala guards, believing him, left. The merchant then beat the thief that night. Similarly, a person with right vision should cover up the fault of seeing something that is not there, which comes from a person who is unable to know. 

The story of Varisena is an example of this situation. 

In the Magadha country, in the city of Rajagriha, King Srenika, Queen Chelini, and their son Varisena, a great Shravaka, fasted for fourteen nights and lay in the cremation ground, giving up his body. On that very day, a beautiful woman from Magadha, Sri Kirti, went to the garden and saw a beautiful necklace. Seeing it, she thought, "How can I live without this ornament?" and fell on her bed. When night came, a man who was attracted to her came to her. 

Page #359:
---------------------------
## Chapter One:

The thief said, "My dear, will you stay with me?" She replied, "If you give me the necklace, I will live with you, and you will be my husband, otherwise not." Hearing this, he went to her house at midnight, and using his skills, stole the necklace and left.  

At dawn, it was discovered that the thief had stolen the necklace. The house guards and the Kottapala pursued him. Unable to escape, he jumped into the river, holding the necklace, and disappeared. The Kottapala saw this and told the merchant, "Lord, the thief is in the river." Hearing this, the merchant said, "Take this fool's head." The sword that Matanga brought to behead him became a garland of flowers around his neck. 

Hearing this, the merchant went to the river and begged forgiveness from the thief. After granting him safety, the thief told the king about his story. The king ordered him to be brought to his palace. The thief said, "I must eat from my own hand." Then, he became a monk near the Muni Sutasena. 

One day, while wandering, he entered the village of Palasakuta near Rajagriha. There, he met the merchant's minister, Agnibhuti. The minister's son, Pushpajala, arranged for him to stay there. After asking his wife, Somilla, "My lord, due to your son's love and my own desire, I want to travel a little with Varishena," he left with Varishena. 

To distract himself, he showed him milk trees and other things, and kept him bound with his hand. He was taken to a place where he heard about the special Dharma, and he became detached. Even though he had taken up asceticism, he did not forget Somilla. 

Both of them traveled to holy places for twelve years and went to the shelter of Vardhamana Swami. There, they heard the celestial beings singing a song about the relationship between the earth and the sky, accompanied by a flower-filled swing. The song went:

"I will not enter the house of the wealthy with a deceitful heart.
How can one live with a deceitful heart, leaving behind the house of the wealthy?"

Hearing this, he became anxious and worried about Somilla. He told Varishena about it, and Varishena took him back to his city to calm him down. 

When they saw the two, Varishena said, "What... 1. with love? 2. without living here?"

## Chapter One

Four swords were simultaneously drawn, aiming to kill him. The city deity trembled, and they were nailed there. In the morning, they were seen by all the people. The angry king, not wanting to kill them, ordered them to be banished after making them ride on donkeys. 

Now, in the Hastinapur of Kuru-Jangala country, King Mahapadma had a queen named Lakshmi-mati and two sons, Padma and Vishnu. One day, Mahapadma gave the kingdom to Padma and, along with Vishnu, became a disciple of Shruta-Sagara-Chandra-Acharya. Bali and others came and became ministers of King Padma. 

In the Kumbhapura fort, King Singhabala, due to his strength, was causing trouble to the Padma Mandala. Seeing Padma's weakness, a strong man asked, "O Lord, what is the reason for your weakness?" The king explained. Hearing this, the strong man requested an order, went there, and with his intelligence and strength, broke into the fort, captured Singhabala, and brought him back. He presented him to Padma, saying, "O Lord, this is Singhabala." The pleased king said, "Ask for any boon you desire." The strong man replied, "I will ask for it when the time comes."

After some days, seven hundred monks, including Akampana-Acharya, arrived there. Recognizing them, the king, fearing for his kingdom, decided to kill them. He remembered his previous boon and asked Padma to give him his kingdom for seven days. Padma, giving him the kingdom for seven days, entered his palace. Bali, with the intention of killing the monks, built a pavilion around them on the Atapa-giri mountain and started a yagna. He used the remains of food, goats, and other animals to create smoke and cause harm to the monks. The monks remained steadfast in their two-fold renunciation.

At midnight, Shruta-Sagara-Chandra-Acharya, who had gone outside, saw the constellation Shravana trembling in the sky. With his knowledge of omens, he declared, "A great calamity is befalling the great monks." Hearing this, a Vidyadhara named Pushpadhara asked, "O Lord, which monks are facing this great calamity?" He replied, "The seven hundred monks, including Akampana-Acharya, in Hastinapur."

---------------------------
## Chapter 22

How is the affliction of the monks destroyed by the Ratnakaranḍa Kasravachara? Vishnu Kumar Muni, who is endowed with great power, resides on the Dharnībhuṣaṇagiri mountain, he destroys it. Hearing this, going near him, thinking, "What is my reaction in this story of Vishnu Kumar, will I be prosperous?" he extended his hand. He went far away, breaking the mountain. Then, deciding, he went there and said to Padmaraja, "Did you cause the affliction of the monks?" "Nothing like that has been done by anyone in our family," he said. Then he said, "What can I do, I had given a boon earlier." Then Vishnu Kumar Muni, making Vamana Brahmana, studied with a divine voice. Balin said, "What do you want?" He said, "Give me three steps of the earth." Ahila Brahmana, even though he was repeatedly told by the people to ask for more, he only asked for that much. Then, after giving him three steps of the earth by the method of hand water, etc., he gave one step on Meru, the second on Manushottaragiri, and after disturbing the celestial chariots, etc., with the third step, he gave that step on Bali's back, killed Bali, and stopped the affliction of the monks. Then, all four ministers, fearing Padmaraja, came and clung to the feet of Vishnu Kumar Muni, Akampanacharya, etc. Those ministers and the Shravakas became monks.

In the Prabhavana, Vajrakumara is an example. His story is like this: In Hastinapura, Garuda was the priest of Balaraja, his son was Somadatta. He studied all the scriptures and went to Ahikshatrapura to his maternal uncle Subhuti. He said, "Show me Durmukharaja!" But he was not shown by the arrogant Durmukharaja. Then, becoming the first in the assembly, he saw him himself, gave him blessings, showed his mastery of all scriptures, and obtained the position of minister. Seeing him like that, Subhuti gave his daughter Yajnadutta in marriage to him. Once, when she was pregnant, during the rainy season, she ate mangoes. 

Page #363:
---------------------------
## Chapter One: The Birth of Dohala

Dohala was born.  Later, Somadatta, while searching in the garden grove, saw Sumitracharrya, who had taken up yoga, sitting under a mango tree, and he was showered with various fruits.  Seeing this, Somadatta took some of the fruits and sent them to a man.  He himself, having heard the Dharma, became dispassionate, took up austerities, studied the Agamas, and became perfected.  He then resided on Mount Nabhigiri, engaged in penance.  Yajnadattā gave birth to a son and, having heard of his brother's whereabouts, went to him.  Knowing of his purity, she went to Mount Nabhigiri with her relatives, saw him engaged in penance, and in great anger, took the child from his lap, cursed him, and returned home.

Meanwhile, in this story, a Vidyadhara named Divakardeva, the younger brother of Purandara, the king of Amaravati, was expelled from his kingdom.  He came to pay homage to the Muni.  Taking the child, he gave him to his wife, named him Vajrakumara, and left.  Vajrakumara grew up in Kanakanagara, near Vimala Vahana, his father's friend, and became a young man proficient in all knowledge.

Then, the daughter of Garudavega and Angavati, Pavanavega, was practicing the knowledge of Prajnapti on Mount Hemanta, when her eyes were pierced by a thorn from a Badari tree, shaken by the wind.  Due to the pain, her mind became unsteady, and she could not complete her studies.  Seeing her in this state, Vajrakumara, with his knowledge, removed the thorn.  Her mind then became steady, and she completed her studies.  She said, "By your grace, I have completed my studies.  You are my husband."  And she married him.  Vajrakumara said, "Father, tell me the truth, whose son am I?  Once you tell me, I will take care of your food and other needs."  Then, he told him the whole story from the beginning, truthfully.  Hearing this, Vajrakumara, along with his relatives, went to Mathura, to the Kshatriya cave, to see his guru.  There, he paid homage to Somadatta, his guru, and Divakardeva, and told them the whole story.  Leaving all his relatives behind with great difficulty, Vajrakumara became a Muni.

In the meantime, in Mathura, there is another story: King Putigandha and Queen Urvila.  She was devoted to the right faith and the propagation of the Jain Dharma.  Every year, for eight days, she organized a chariot procession for the Jina, the Jina-Indra Rathayatra, for three days.  In the same city, there was a wealthy merchant named Sagardatta.

---------------------------
In the Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra, the noble lady Samudradattā's daughter, Daridrā, was living in poverty after the death of her husband, Sāgaradatta. Once, while eating leftover food in another person's house, she was seen by two monks who had entered the house. The younger monk said, "Alas! This noble lady is living in great hardship." Hearing this, the elder monk said, "She will become the queen consort of this king." 

The monk Dharmaśrīvadanka, while begging for alms, heard this prophecy and, believing that the monks' words were true, took Daridrā to his monastery and nourished her with delicious food. One day, during the spring month of Chaitra, the king saw her in her youthful beauty and was overcome with love. He then asked his ministers to find a way to marry her. The ministers asked a magician, "If the king accepts my Dharma, I will give him the woman." The king agreed to all the conditions and married Daridrā. She became the queen consort and was very devoted to her husband. 

During the Falgunanandīśvara festival, she saw the chariot procession and said to the king, "My lord, let my chariot be the first to go through the city." The king agreed. Then, Urvilā said, "If my chariot goes first, I will participate in the festival; otherwise, I will not." She made this vow and went to the cave of the Kshatriya, where she met the Ācārya Somadatta. 

At that time, the celestial beings, Divākardeva and others, had come to pay their respects to the monk Vajrakumāra. They heard about Urvilā's vow and told Vajrakumāra about it. Vajrakumāra then ordered the chariot procession to be held, fulfilling Urvilā's vow. Seeing this magnificent procession, many people, including the beautiful Buddha-devotee Pūtimukhā, became devoted to the Jina Dharma.

Some may wonder, "What is the purpose of the eight limbs of Right View, since even someone lacking them can still achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death?" To this, the text says:

**21**

"Right View, even without its limbs, cannot cut off the cycle of birth and death. Just as a mantra without its letters cannot cure the pain of poison."

"Right View" is the agent, "the cycle of birth and death" is the object, "the cycle of existence" is the process, "to cut off" means to destroy. "Not capable" means not able. What kind of Right View is it? "Without its limbs" means lacking its limbs.

## Chapter One.
25
That which is devoid of the nature of doubt, etc., is defective. In order to support this meaning, an example is given: "Nahi" etc., the mantra used to remove the poison of a snakebite, even if it is slightly deficient in letters, does not kill or destroy the poison. Therefore, right faith, with its eight limbs, is the means to destroy the cycle of existence.

If it is said that it is the means to destroy the cycle of existence, then it is said that there are three types due to the difference between the ignorant, the devotee, and the heretic. Here, the ignorant is shown, as it is said:

"The bathing in the river and the ocean, the heaping of sand and stones, the falling from the mountain, and the entering of fire, are all said to be the ways of the ignorant." (22)

"The ignorant" - the state of being ignorant. What is it? "The bathing in the river and the ocean" - the river and the ocean, the bathing there with the intention of achieving merit, not with the intention of washing the body. Similarly, "the heaping" - the building of a stupa. Of what? "Sand and stones" - sand and stones. Similarly, "the falling from the mountain" - falling from a mountain, etc. "The entering of fire" - entering fire. All these are said to be "the ways of the ignorant." (22)

To explain the devotee, it is said:

"One who desires a boon, who is stained with passion and aversion, and who worships the gods, is said to be the devotee." (23)

"The devotee" - it is said. "Who worships" - who worships. What gods? "Who are stained with passion and aversion" - stained with passion and aversion. What is special? "Who desires a boon" - who desires worldly benefits. By what? "By the desire to obtain a boon" - the desire for a desired benefit. Now, if one were to do this with the desire for a boon, then it would be a cause for the decline of right faith, as it is the practice of the followers, etc., to worship the gods of the teachings. But when one worships the gods with devotion...

If he performs those actions towards them as a follower of the Ratnakaranda Shravaka conduct, then that is not a cause of dullness. Even if requested by those who are superior in the path of vision, they will surely give. If he does not do so, due to the special nature of the deities, the attainment of results will not be quickly accomplished without obstacles. For example, in the worship of the entourage of a Chakravarti, the servants do not see such attainment of results from the Chakravarti. || 23 || Now, showing the nature of the right vision and the nature of the deluded heretics, he says:
"The reward of heretics, who are involved in the cycle of rebirth, who are violent from the beginning of their bonds, is to be known as the delusion of heretics." || 24 || The delusion of heretics is to be known, to be understood. Who is this? "Reward" is praise. Of whom? "Of heretics," those who have false views and signs. What kind of heretics? "Those who are violent from the beginning of their bonds," those who have bonds, such as slaves and servants, and beginnings, such as agriculture, and violence, such as "various kinds of killing of living beings, along with them."

**First Chapter.**

The soul who is 'garvitashya' (proud) and has a conceited mind, in the manner described, 'atyeti' (transgresses) the 'dharmasthan' (abode of dharma), which includes the three jewels and other things, with disregard and transgression. 'So atyeti' (He transgresses). Whom? The 'dharma' (three jewels). How? 'Atmiyam jinapatipranitam' (the three jewels, which are self-realized and ordained by the Jina). Because 'dharmo' (dharma) does not exist without the 'dharmiks' (those who practice the three jewels). || 26 ||

One might ask, how can pride be prohibited for those who are endowed with wealth, family, and other possessions? To this, it is said:

If there is an end to sin, what is the use of other possessions?
If there is a flow of sin, what is the use of other possessions? || 27 ||

'Papanirodha' (the end of sin) is the cessation of 'ashubha karma' (unwholesome karma), which is the covering of knowledge and other things. If this 'sadbhavah' (goodness) exists, then 'anyasampada' (other possessions), such as wealth, family, and other possessions, are of no use. Because, for one who understands the goodness of this, the pride that is based on these possessions will not arise. 'Atha papaasravo asti' (If there is a flow of sin). The 'asrava' (flow) of 'papa' (sin), which is 'ashubha karma' (unwholesome karma), is the flow of falsehood, attachment, etc. What is the use of these possessions for one who understands that this leads to 'durgati' (bad rebirth) and other things? Because, it is not appropriate to have pride in these possessions. || 27 ||

To further explain this, it is said:

Even one who is endowed with right faith, born in the body of an elephant,
Devas (gods) know him to be like a burning ember covered with ashes. || 28 ||

'Devam' (the worthy of worship). 'Vidu' (they know). Who are they? 'Deva' (gods). "Deva vitassa"
"Namanti jassa dhamme saya mano" (They bow down to him whose mind is in dharma). Whom? 'Matangadehajam api' (even a Chandala, born in the body of an elephant). How? 'Samyagdarshanasampannam' (endowed with right faith). Therefore, 'bhasmagudhangarantaraujasam' (like a burning ember covered with ashes). Covered with ashes, and the ember is within him, and there is light and purity within him. || 28 ||

## Chapter One

**It is said that** **Right Faith** (Samyak Darshan), which is the essence of the Three Jewels (Ratnatraya), is the **rudder** (Karnasadhar) in the path of liberation (Mokshamarga). Just as the rudder is essential for the boat to navigate the sea and reach the shore, similarly, **Right Faith** is the rudder that guides the boat of liberation to cross the ocean of samsara (cycle of birth and death). || 31 ||

**Now, since the excellence of Right Faith is established, its role as the rudder is also established. But from where does this excellence arise?**

**It is said:**

The birth, existence, growth, and fruition of the stream of knowledge (Vidya Vritti) do not exist without Right Faith (Samyaktava), just as a tree does not exist without a seed. || 32 ||

**"Without Right Faith"** (Samyaktava asati) means in the absence of right knowledge. **"Do not exist"** (na santi) refers to what? It refers to the birth, existence, growth, and fruition of the stream of knowledge. Of whom? Of the stream of knowledge (Vidya Vritti). This means: the birth (pradurabhava) of knowledge (Vidya) in the form of understanding (mati) and insight (jnana), the existence (avasthana) of the stream of conduct (Vritti) in the form of Samayika (daily meditation) and other virtuous practices, as the determinant of the true nature of things (padartha paricchedakatva) and as the cause of the destruction of karma (karma nirjara) and other benefits, the growth (utkarsha) of the already existing stream of knowledge, and the fruition (phalodya) of the fruit (phala) in the form of the worship of gods (deva puja), heaven (swarga), and liberation (apavarga).

**In the absence of what, these things do not exist?** It is said: **"Just as a tree does not exist without a seed"** (bija abhave taror iva). Just as a tree does not exist without a seed, which is the root cause (mula karan), similarly, the stream of knowledge (Vidya Vritti) does not exist without Right Faith (Samyaktava), which is the root cause. || 32 ||

**And, even though a householder (grihastha) who possesses Right Faith is superior to a monk (muni) who does not possess it, Right Faith itself is even more superior.**

**It is said:**

A householder (grihastha) who is on the path of liberation (mokshamarga) and free from delusion (nirmoha) is not deluded (naiva mohavan). A monk (anagaro) who is a householder (grihi) is superior to a deluded (mohina) monk (muni) who is free from delusion (nirmoha). || 33 ||

**"Free from delusion"** (nirmoha) means free from the karmas that obstruct Right Faith (darshanapratibandhakamohaniyakarma) and who has attained Right Faith (saddarshanaparinata).

**Thus, a householder who is on the path of liberation becomes free from delusion. A monk, on the other hand...**

## Chapter One:

**31**

- The degeneration of form, short lifespan, death within a few moments, poverty, and birth in a poor family. Even though all this happens to those who are "avrathika" (without vows), even those who are "anuvrata" (with minor vows), what happens to them in the next life? The text says: "They become full of vigor, radiance, knowledge, strength, fame, prosperity, victory, and wealth. They are born in great families, with great goals, and become the leaders of humanity, purified by the right vision." **36**

"Purified by the right vision" means "purified by the right vision, those who have a pure and holy vision." "Leaders of humanity" means "the leaders of humans, the best among humans." 

The text further describes their qualities: "Vigor" refers to enthusiasm, "radiance" refers to brilliance or glow, "knowledge" refers to innate and unlearnable wisdom, "strength" refers to exceptional power, "fame" refers to exceptional reputation, "prosperity" refers to wealth in terms of family, children, and grandchildren, "victory" refers to the excellence of one's qualities over others, "wealth" refers to wealth in terms of money, grain, and other possessions. They are "accompanied by wealth" meaning they have all these qualities. 

Similarly, "great families" means "they are born in great families," and "great goals" means "they have great goals in life, characterized by dharma, artha, kama, and moksha." **36**

The text further states that they attain the position of Indra (king of gods) through the purity of their right vision: "Those who are nourished by the eight qualities, have a distinct vision, and are adorned with exceptional beauty, enjoy the company of celestial nymphs in heaven for a long time, being devotees of the Jinas." **37**

"In the assembly of gods and goddesses," "for a long time" means "for a very long time," and "enjoy" means "play and have fun." 

What are their qualities? "Nourished by the eight qualities" refers to the eight qualities of anima (becoming small), mahima (becoming large), laghima (becoming light), prapti (attaining anything), prakamya (going anywhere), ishitva (being the lord), vashitva (controlling others), and kamaropa (assuming any form). They are "nourished" meaning their body parts are always well-nourished, or they are "nourished" meaning they are complete and always joyful. 

Similarly, "adorned with exceptional beauty" means "they have exceptional beauty compared to other gods," and "adorned" means "served by them, served by them, they are Indras." **37**

The text further states that they also attain the position of Chakravarti (universal emperor):

## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar

**Verse 38:**

Those who are "spashtadrisha" (clear-sighted), possessing pure right faith, are the ones who are able to "vartayitum" (rotate) the "chakra" (wheel) of the "ratna" (jewel). They are capable of "prabhavanti" (being able to) engage in all actions that are under their control. How are they like this? They are "sarvabhumipataya" (lords of all lands), the rulers of the six continents of the earth. And again, how are they like this? They are "navanidhisaptadyaratnaadhisha" (lords of the nine treasures and the seven pairs of jewels), the masters of the nine treasures and the fourteen jewels. They are "kshatramoulishekharacharana" (those whose feet are adorned with the crowns of the Kshatriyas), those who protect beings from the evils of the Kshatriyas, the kings, whose crowns are on their heads.

**Verse 39:**

Similarly, it is said that those who are "dharmachakra" (wheel of dharma) possess the greatness of "saddarshana" (right vision). They are "amaraasuranarapatibhiryamadharapathibhishcha" (respected by the gods, demons, human kings, and the lords of Yama), those whose feet are like "nutapadambhoja" (lotus blossoms). They are "drishtya" (by virtue of their vision), those who have a clear understanding of the truth. They are "vrishachakradhara" (holders of the bull-wheel), the Tirthankaras, who hold the wheel of dharma. What is special about them? They are "nutapadambhoja" (those whose feet are like lotus blossoms), praised by the gods, demons, human kings, and the lords of Yama. They are "sunishchitarthi" (those whose purpose is clear and definite), those whose purpose is clear and definite, and they are "lokasaranaya" (refuge of the world), the refuge of the world, who are suffering from various karmic afflictions. 

**Note:** This translation preserves the Jain terms and provides explanations for them. It also attempts to capture the essence of the verses while remaining faithful to the original text. 

Page #373:
---------------------------
## First Chapter.

Those who take refuge in the **darshan** (right vision), which is the protection from the dangers of the cycle of birth and death, experience **shiva** (liberation). How? Because they are **ajar** (free from disease), **akshaya** (free from decay), **avyaabadha** (free from obstacles), **vishok-bhaya-shanka** (free from sorrow, fear, and doubt), and **kasthagata-sukha-vidya-vibhavam** (possessing the power of supreme happiness and knowledge), and **vimala** (pure).

The previous verses have described the fruits of **samyak darshan** (right vision). Now, summarizing the essence of the right vision, the author says:

The **deva-indra-chakra** (assembly of celestial kings) is immeasurable in its glory, and the **raja-indra-chakra** (assembly of earthly kings) is worthy of being worshipped by the heads of the kings of the earth. The **dharma-indra-chakra** (assembly of righteous kings) has conquered all the worlds. Having obtained **shiva** (liberation), the **bhavya** (worthy soul) who has devotion to the **jina** (liberated soul) attains it.

Who is this **bhavya**? It is the one who has **jina-bhakti** (devotion to the jina). What does he do? He obtains the **deva-indra-chakra** (assembly of celestial kings). What is its characteristic? It is **ameya-mana** (immeasurable in its glory). Similarly, he obtains the **raja-indra-chakra** (assembly of earthly kings). What is its characteristic? It is **avani-indra-shiro-rchaniya** (worthy of being worshipped by the heads of the kings of the earth). 

Page #374:
---------------------------
Ratnakarandaka Shravakaachara

Archaniya in Avanya, in their own respective Prithvi, Indra, crowned with Mukuta, the Kings, their heads are to be worshipped. Similarly, having obtained the Dharmachakra, the best qualities of Dharma, like Ksama, etc., or the Indras, the performers, the propagators, or the Tirthankaras, etc., their Chakra, the Sangha, the Dharma, or the Tirthakruta, the indicative Chakra, the Dharmachakra. How? 'Adharit Sarvaloka', the entire Tribhvana, the entire world, has been brought to servitude by whom. Having obtained all this, afterwards, he attains Shiva, the Bhavy. || 41 ||

Thus, the first chapter of the Paskaadhyayana Tika, composed by Prabhachandra, composed by Samantabhadra Swami. || 1 ||

## The Second Chapter on the Right to Knowledge

Now, to explain the nature of Dharma, which is in the form of perception, and to explain the nature of knowledge, it is said:

**That which is complete, without excess, and true, without contradiction, is known without doubt by those who have attained knowledge.** (1)

**"Veda"** means "to know". **"Yat tad ahur"** means "that which is said". **"Jnana"** means "knowledge in the form of perception and scripture". **"Aagaminah"** means "those who have attained knowledge". How do they know? **"Nissandeham"** means "without doubt", as it is. **"Vina cha vipreetat"** means "without contradiction", without any contradiction, meaning that it is free from contradiction. Similarly, **"Anyoon"** means "complete", the whole essence of the object. **"Tad jnana na nyoonam"** means "that knowledge is not incomplete", it is not lacking in any way. **"Vikalam tat swaroopam yad veda"** means "that which knows the true nature of the object". **"Tarhi jeevaadi vastu swaroope avidyamanam api sarvatha nityatva kshanikatvadvaitaadi roopam kalpayitva yad vetti tad adhika athai viditva jnana bhavishyati"** means "If it knows the true nature of the object, then it will know more than that, even if it is not present in the nature of the soul and other objects, by imagining the eternal, the momentary, the non-dual, etc." **"Anatiriktam"** means "not exceeding", not exceeding the true nature of the object. **"Yad veda tad jnana na punar tad vat swaroopaad adhikam kalpana shilpi kalpitam yad veda"** means "That which knows is not exceeding the true nature of the object, it is not something imagined by the mind". Thus, due to the power of these four qualifications, it is possible for it to be the knower of the true meaning. **"Yathaabhootartha vedakatvam tasya sambhavati tadarshayati"** means "It shows that it is possible for it to be the knower of the true meaning". **"Yathaatathya"** means "true", the true nature of the object as it is. **"Yad veda tad jnana bhavashrut"** means "That which knows is knowledge in the form of perception and scripture".

Because the nature of knowledge itself has the power to reveal the true nature of all objects, including the soul, in its entirety, just like perfect knowledge. This is stated:

**"In perfect knowledge, there is a difference in the revelation of all truths, whether it is direct or indirect, and the object is either one or the other."** (1)

Therefore, it is to be understood as the same as Dharma. Because of this difference, it has the power to achieve heaven and liberation, as it is the main and fundamental cause. (1)

**Ratnakaranḍakaśrāvakācāra**

This text discusses the different types of subjects within the Ratnakaranḍakaśrāvakācāra. It states:

"The first Anuyoga is called Ākhyāna, Carita, Purāṇa, and Puṇya. 
The Bodhi, Samādhi, and Nidhāna are known as Bodha, which is appropriate." (2)

"Bodha" refers to true Śruta-jñāna (knowledge gained from scriptures). "Bodhati" means "knows." What does it know? The first Anuyoga. What is meant by the term "Prathama Anuyoga"? It is explained as "Carita, Purāṇa, and both." Carita refers to a story based on a single person, while Purāṇa refers to a story based on sixty-three Śalākāpuruṣas (illustrious persons). Both of these fall under the term "Prathama Anuyoga." The term "Ākhyāna" is used to distinguish it from other types of stories, as it focuses on the ultimate meaning and subject matter. Similarly, "Puṇya" refers to the first Anuyoga because listening to it generates Puṇya (merit). 

"Bodhi, Samādhi, and Nidhāna" refer to the attainment of Samyagdarsana (right faith) for those who have not yet attained it, and the continued attainment of Samādhi (concentration) and Dharmashukla (purity of Dharma) for those who have already attained it. Listening to this Anuyoga leads to the attainment of Darsana, Dharma, and Dhāyana (meditation).

"Thus, in this world, the knowledge of the directions is chanted and spoken. The Karana are like a group of days that have passed." (1)

"The division of the world and the non-world, the cycle of Yugas, and the four Gatis (paths of existence) are like a mirror, reflecting the Karana Anuyoga." (3)

"Tatha" refers to the Prathama Anuyoga section. "Mati" refers to contemplation and Śruta-jñāna. "Avaiti" means "knows." What does it know? "Karana Anuyoga," which includes the division of the world and the non-world, and the characteristics of the five Sangrahas (collections). How is it like a mirror? Just as a mirror reflects the true form of the face, the Karana Anuyoga also reveals the true nature of its subject matter. 

"Loka-aloka..." This verse is also found in the Kha and Ga manuscripts.

"Mati-jñāna is not Śruta-jñāna." This is found in the Ga manuscript.

In the Ratnakaranda Shravaka-chara, due to the characteristics of the karma, which is acquired by the force of the characteristics of mithyatva, avirati, pramada, and kshaya, there is a bond with the self. This bond is the cause of the destruction of the karma, and the liberation from the karma is the characteristic of the liberation. This is the light of the dravya-anuyoga, which shines even in the absence of the karma. How? The light of the Shruta-vidya, the Shruta-vidya, the Bhava-shruta, the Saivala-loka, the light, where it is. Just as a lamp does not become a particle, so also the Jiva and others do not become the light. || 5 ||

Thus ends the second chapter of the Upasaka-adhyayana-tika, composed by Prabha Chandra, on the Samantabhadra Swami. || 2 ||

## The Third Chapter: The Right Conduct

**BE**  Now, the scripture explains the nature of Dharma as Right Conduct:  One who has attained knowledge through the removal of the darkness of delusion, adopts Right Conduct for the elimination of attachment and aversion. 

**1.**  "Right Conduct" refers to the characteristic of conduct that is free from violence and other vices.  "Adopts" means to accept.  Who is this?  The "noble" soul, the one destined for liberation.  What is his characteristic?  He has attained knowledge.  Why?  Because he has gained vision.  And this vision, how did it arise?  Through the "removal of the darkness of delusion."  Delusion is the delusion of perception, and this is the darkness.  Its removal is the cessation of delusion, or its gradual weakening.  Or, delusion is the delusion of perception and conduct, and the darkness is the veil of ignorance, etc.  The removal of these is the removal of the delusion of perception.  This is the meaning:  Through the removal of the delusion of perception, one gains vision.  With the removal of darkness, one attains knowledge through vision.  The soul, free from the veil of ignorance, develops knowledge, and due to the grace of right vision, it attains the correct understanding.  Such a soul, free from the delusion of conduct, adopts Right Conduct.  For what purpose?  "For the elimination of attachment and aversion."  The elimination of attachment and aversion is the cause for the elimination of violence and other vices.  

**1.** ...  For only when these are eliminated can the elimination of violence and other vices occur.  

**2.**  The elimination of violence and other vices is achieved.  Why?  Because of the elimination of attachment and aversion.  This is the meaning here:  The elimination of attachment and aversion, etc., leads to the cessation of the delusion of perception, etc., and this results in Right Conduct, which is characterized by the elimination of violence and other vices.  Therefore, the elimination of attachment and aversion, etc., leads to the elimination of the more subtle and the most subtle forms of violence, etc.  In the realm of the virtues of restraint, etc., attachment, aversion, violence, etc., remain as long as they are not completely eliminated. 

Page #380:
---------------------------
## 40

**Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar**

The destruction of the six passions and the rest, and from that, the state of perfect equanimity, characterized by the complete cessation of violence and the rest, is the highest conduct. To support this meaning, the author presents an analogy:

"What kind of person serves kings without expecting anything in return? He who does not desire or seek any benefit, purpose, or result. Such a person, who is not motivated by any expectation, serves kings." || 2 ||

Here, someone else asks: "It is said that one should follow the path, but its characteristics have not been explained. Please explain them."

In response, the author says:

"Abstinence from violence, falsehood, theft, sexual misconduct, and attachment is called conduct." || 3 ||

What is conduct? It is the practice of abstinence. From what? From violence, falsehood, theft, and the rest. The author himself will explain the nature of violence and the rest. Abstinence is not only from these, but also from sexual misconduct and attachment. From what kind of things? From those that are like a stream of sin, like a channel of sin. These are the doors to the influx of sin. Who abstains from these? The one who is called a "Samjna," who has knowledge of what is to be avoided and what is to be sought. || 3 ||

If this is the nature of conduct, then it is divided into two types:

"The complete path is for those who are without attachments, and the incomplete path is for those who are attached." || 4 ||

The path, characterized by abstinence from violence and the rest, which was described earlier, is both complete and incomplete. The complete path is the form of the great vows. Who is it for? For the monks, the "munis," who are free from all attachments, both external and internal. The incomplete path is the form of the minor vows. Who is it for? For the householders, who are attached. || 4 || 

Page #381:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three:

Here, the author explains the **Vikala** (partial) vows:

For householders, there are three types of vows, based on **Anu**, **Guna**, and **Shiksha** (small, good, and learning). These three types are further divided into five, three, and four categories respectively.

**Anu** vows are of five types:

* **Anu** vows are partial vows. They involve refraining from:
    * **Praṇātipāta** (violence against living beings)
    * **Vithathavyāhara** (false speech)
    * **Steya** (theft)
    * **Kāma** (sexual misconduct)
    * **Mūrchā** (attachment)

* These are refrained from in their **sthūla** (gross) forms. This is because it is impossible for an **Anu** vow holder to completely avoid all transgressions. Therefore, they refrain from the gross forms of violence, false speech, etc.

For example, one who has refrained from killing large animals may still kill small ones. Similarly, one who has refrained from gross lies may still tell subtle ones. Likewise, one who has refrained from stealing large amounts may still take small things that are not rightfully theirs. And one who has refrained from sexual misconduct with a woman who is already married may still engage in other forms of misconduct.

Therefore, the **Anu** vows are based on refraining from the gross forms of these five transgressions. 

Page #382:
---------------------------


Page #383:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three

**43.**

The meaning is that I do not engage in bodily actions myself. Similarly, I do not cause harm to living beings with my body, nor do I encourage others to harm living beings with the intention of harming them. Likewise, I do not approve of others harming living beings with their bodies, such as by cutting nails or hair. This is the vow of non-violence. || 7 ||

Now, the author describes the transgressions of this vow:

Cutting, binding, tormenting, excessive burdening, and deprivation of food are the five transgressions. || 8 ||

These transgressions are various and disfigure the vow. What are they? Five. Of whom? Of those who have abandoned the killing of large beings. How? The author says, "Cutting" refers to the removal of limbs like ears, noses, etc. "Binding" refers to preventing movement by tying up someone in a desired place. "Tormenting" refers to causing pain through punishment, beating, or burning. "Excessive burdening" refers to placing a burden beyond what is just. Not only these four, but also "deprivation of food" refers to preventing, prohibiting, or stopping the consumption of food and drink. || 8 ||

Having explained the vow of non-violence, the author now explains the vow of truthfulness:

He does not speak falsehoods, nor does he cause others to speak falsehoods, even in times of danger.

This is what the wise ones say: "Falsehood is the root of hatred." || 9 ||

He is a liar, and falsehood is the root of hatred. Therefore, refraining from hatred is the only way to refrain from falsehood. Who says this? The wise ones, the virtuous ones, like Ganadharadeva and others. What do the wise ones say? What is falsehood? It is something untrue, something false. What kind of falsehood? It is a gross falsehood, where speaking it leads to killing, binding, etc., of oneself or others, and brings punishment from the king and others. He himself does not speak such falsehoods. Similarly, he does not cause others to speak such falsehoods. Not only falsehoods, but even truth, like "He is a thief," "He is a murderer," etc., he does not speak himself, nor does he cause others to speak. What is special about the truth that is spoken in times of danger to others? It causes harm to others. || 9 ||

---------------------------
## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar:

**On the transgression of the Anuvrata of Satya (Truthfulness):**

Now, I will speak of the transgressions of the Anuvrata of Satya. They are five: **Parivada**, **Raho-abhyakhya**, **Paishunya**, **Kuta-lekha-karanam**, and **Nyasa-apaharita**.

**Parivada** means to falsely instruct others about actions, especially those related to their well-being and liberation.

**Raho-abhyakhya** means to reveal a secret action performed by a man and woman in private.

**Paishunya** means to reveal someone's secret intentions, knowing them through their body language, expressions, etc., out of envy or malice.

**Kuta-lekha-karanam** means to falsely claim to have done something that one has not done, or to claim to have not done something that one has done, with the intention to deceive.

**Nyasa-apaharita** means to take a small amount of someone's property, claiming that it was forgotten or that it was given as a gift.

Thus, there are four transgressions of the Anuvrata of Satya: Parivada, Raho-abhyakhya, Paishunya, and Kuta-lekha-karanam. Nyasa-apaharita is the fifth transgression.

**On the Anuvrata of Chorya-virati (Non-stealing):**

Now, I will explain the nature of the Anuvrata of Chorya-virati. It is defined as:

**"He does not steal what is deposited, fallen, or forgotten, nor does he take what is not given. This is the restraint from minor stealing."**

**Akrish-chouryata** (minor stealing) is restrained from **sthula-chouryata** (major stealing). **Uparamanam** (restraint) means not taking what is not given. What is not given? **Parasva** (another's property). What kind of property? **Nihitham** (deposited), **Patitam** (fallen), or **Suvismrtam** (forgotten). The word **"va"** (or) indicates that all these conditions are included. Thus, one who does not steal what is deposited, fallen, or forgotten, and does not take what is not given, is said to have restrained himself from minor stealing.

**On the transgression of the Anuvrata of Chorya-virati:**

Now, I will speak of the transgressions of the Anuvrata of Chorya-virati. They are five: **Choura-prayoga**, **Choura-dana**, **Vilopana**, **Sadrisha-sammishra**, and **Heena-adhika-vinimanan**.

**Choura-prayoga** means to use stolen property.

**Choura-dana** means to give stolen property to someone else.

**Vilopana** means to hide stolen property.

**Sadrisha-sammishra** means to mix stolen property with one's own property.

**Heena-adhika-vinimanan** means to exchange stolen property for something of lesser or greater value.

Thus, there are five transgressions of the Anuvrata of Chorya-virati. 

Page #385:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three: Non-Stealing and Avoidance of Violence

**Non-stealing (Asteya)** involves refraining from theft. There are five types of violence (Aticharas):

1. **Chora-prayoga:**  The act of stealing oneself, instigating someone else to steal, or approving of another's theft.
2. **Chora-artha-adanam:** Accepting stolen goods without being instigated or approving of the theft.
3. **Vilopam:**  Taking something that is not rightfully yours, even if it is not considered theft according to the law. This also includes crossing borders with goods that are prohibited.
4. **Viruddha-rajya-atikramam:**  Crossing borders with goods that are prohibited in the other kingdom. This refers to taking goods of low value in exchange for goods of high value in another kingdom.
5. **Sadrisha-sanmishram:**  This refers to the act of mixing similar substances, such as mixing oil with ghee, or using artificial gold to deceive others.
6. **Heena-adhika-vinimanam:**  This refers to the act of exchanging goods of unequal value, such as giving someone something of lesser value in exchange for something of greater value.

**Avoiding Violence (Ahimsa)**

The text then explains the nature of the vow of non-violence (Brahma-virati-anu-vrata) by stating:

"One who is afraid of sin does not approach another's wife, nor does one encourage others to do so. This avoidance of another's wife is also called contentment with one's own wife."

**Explanation:**

* The text states that one who is afraid of sin (paapa-bhitih) will not approach another's wife, whether she is married or not.
* It also states that one will not encourage others to approach another's wife.
* This avoidance of another's wife is also called contentment with one's own wife (svadara-santosha-nama).

**Note:** The text uses the term "paradara" (another's wife) to refer to any woman who is not one's own wife. This is a Jain term that is used to emphasize the importance of respecting the boundaries of others. 

Page #386:
---------------------------
## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar

**Verse 14:**

The five transgressions of the *Asmar* (non-attachment) *anuvrata* (minor vow) are:

* **Anyavivāha:** Marriage to another (while already married).
* **Anangakrīḍā:** Sexual activity with someone other than one's spouse.
* **Viṭatva:** Engaging in frivolous talk and actions.
* **Vipulatṛṣā:** Excessive desire for worldly pleasures.
* **Itvarīkagamana:** Hasty approach towards another man (for a woman).

**Verse 15:**

The *Parimitaparigraha* (limited possessions) *anuvrata* is defined as:

* **Parimāy:** Limiting one's possessions to a certain amount.
* **Niṣpṛhatā:** Being free from desire for more than what is limited.

This *anuvrata* is also called *Icchaparimāṇanāma* (named after the measure of desire) because it is based on limiting one's desire for possessions.

**Verse 16:**

The five transgressions of the *Parimitaparigraha* *anuvrata* are:

* **Ativahana:** Excessive transportation (of goods).
* **Ati-sangraha:** Excessive accumulation (of wealth).
* **Vismaya-lobha:** Excessive greed and desire.
* **Ati-bhāra-vahana:** Excessive burdening (oneself with possessions). 

Page #387:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three:

**'Vिक्षepa' (Deviation)**

Five 'Lakshyanta' (are determined) are determined. Of what? Of 'Parimit Parigraha' (limited possessions), not only the five 'Anuvrata' (minor vows) like non-violence, but also of 'Parimit Parigraha'. The word 'Cha' here means 'and'. What are those deviations? It is said: 'Ati Vahana' (excessive transportation) etc. For the sake of greed and avarice, when a limit is set for possessions, then due to the influence of greed, one engages in excessive transportation.  'Ati' (excessive) applies to each of the greed-related actions.  One gathers more than necessary, thinking that this grain etc. will bring a special profit.  When that profit is obtained and the item is sold, even if it was not originally collected, or if an additional amount is obtained through the sale, one feels excessive joy and sorrow due to the influence of greed.  Even when a special profit is obtained, one becomes excessively greedy due to the desire for more profit.  Due to the influence of greed, one loads excessive weight, which is 'Ati Bhar Vahana' (excessive weight transportation). These are the five deviations. || 16 ||

**The fruits of these five 'Anuvrata' (minor vows) without deviation are described as follows:**

Those who abide by the five 'Anuvrata' without deviation, attain the 'Suraloka' (heavenly realm), where 'Avadhi' (clairvoyance) with eight powers and a divine body are obtained. || 17 ||

'Phalanti' (bear fruit) means they yield results. Who are they? Those who abide by the five 'Anuvrata' are the ones who abide by the five 'Anuvrata'. What kind of 'Anuvrata'? Those without deviation, those without transgression. What do they attain? The 'Suraloka'. What is obtained in the 'Suraloka'? 'Avadhi' (clairvoyance). 'Ashta Guna' (eight powers) like 'Anima' (the power to become small) etc. And a divine body, free from the seven 'Dhatu' (elements). All these are obtained there. || 17 ||

**Here, one might doubt if anyone in this world has actually attained the fruits of practicing the 'Anuvrata' like non-violence, and if they are practicing it for the sake of the next world.**

To address this doubt, it is said:

Matanga, Dhandeva, and Varisheṇa, and after them, Nili and Jaya, have attained the highest level of worship. || 18 || 

Page #388:

Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar
From the vow of non-violence, even a Matanga (outcaste) and a Chandala (outcaste) can attain the highest excellence in worship.
Here is the story. In a beautiful country, there was a king named Mahabala in the city of Podanapura. On the eighth day of the Nandishvara festival, the king had declared a ban on killing any living being for eight days. But Balakumara, who was very fond of meat, did not see any human being in the royal garden. So he secretly killed a royal frog and prepared it to eat. When the king heard about the killing of the frog, he was very angry and started searching for the killer of the frog. The gardener of that garden saw him killing the frog on a tree. At night, he told his wife, and she told the king. In the morning, the gardener was questioned. He said, "My son is breaking my orders." The angry king ordered the Kottapala to cut Balakumara into nine pieces. Then, the men who were sent to bring the Matanga to the place of execution saw him and said, "My dear Matanga, the Matangya has gone to the village. Tell them that." Saying this, he hid himself in a corner of the house. When the Talaura questioned him, he said, "The Matangya has gone to the village today." The Talaura said, "That sinner, that wicked man, has gone to the village today. Because of killing the prince, he will get a lot of gold, jewels, etc." Hearing their words, the greedy Taiya, who was known as Hastasanya, showed them the way to the village and said again and again, "He has gone to the village." Then, they took him out of the house and handed him over to the prince for execution. He said, "I will not kill him on the fourteenth day." Then, the Talaura took him to the king and said, "O King, this prince will not kill him." The king said, "He was bitten by a snake and died. He was buried in the cremation ground. He was revived by the wind of all the medicines, sages, and enemies. For his sake, I took the vow of non-violence for fourteen days. Therefore, today...
1. Podanapura, K-G-Path. 2. Royal Garden, Kh-G-Path. 3. The mother was afraid, G-Path. 

Page #389:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three

"I do not kill," said the god, "let him do what he knows." Thinking that the untouchable Chandala's vow was a lie, the angry king bound both of them tightly and said, "These two are to be punished." There, even in the face of Matanga's imminent death, the vow's greatness, due to his non-violence vow, was manifested by the water deity. A throne, a jeweled pavilion, a divine drum, and other attendants were created in the water.  Hearing this, King Mahabala, filled with fear, worshipped him, sprinkled him with water from his own umbrella, and declared him "touchable" and "distinguished." This is the first Anuvrata.

Due to his Anuvrata of abstaining from falsehood, Dhandeva, the best among merchants, received great worship.

Here is his story:

In Jambudvipa, in the eastern Videha, in the city of Pushkalavati, in the city of  Pundarikinya, there were two merchants, Jindeva and Dhandeva, both with little wealth. Dhandeva was truthful. They agreed to share any profits equally, without witnesses, and then went to a distant land. They earned much wealth and returned to Pundarikinya, skillfully managing their affairs. There, Jindeva, seeking profit, did not give Dhandeva his share. He gave him a small amount, claiming it was appropriate. Then, in a public court, in front of his family, the merchants, and the king, Jindeva, relying on the agreement without witnesses, said, "I did not speak falsely about his share; I spoke truthfully." Dhandeva also spoke truthfully, saying, "It is indeed half of our earnings." Then, according to the king's law, their wealth was divided. Dhandeva was pure, the other was not. Then, everyone gave their wealth to Dhandeva, and he was worshipped and praised by all. This is the second Anuvrata.

Due to his Anuvrata of abstaining from stealing, Varishena received great worship. The qualities of stability, virtue, and non-violence are said to be visible in this third Anuvrata.

## Ratnakarandaka Shravakaachar

Then, after that, there was Neela Jay. And then, after them, as they are, so is the excellence of worship attained. There, Neela, the daughter of the merchant, attained excellence of worship, having taken the vow of non-violence towards all beings. 

Here is her story: In the country of Lota, in the town of Bhrigukachapa, there was a king named Vasupala. The merchant Jinadatta, with his wife Jinadatta, had a daughter named Neela, who was extremely beautiful. In the same place, there was another wealthy man named Samudradatta, with his wife Sagaradatta, and their son Sagaradatta. 

One day, during a grand festival, Sagaradatta saw Neela, adorned with all her ornaments, standing there, her body adorned with sandalwood paste. He said, "Is this some goddess?" Hearing this, his friend Priyadatta said, "This is Neela, the daughter of the merchant Jinadatta." 

Sagaradatta became completely infatuated with her and thought, "How can I obtain her?" He became weak with worry about her marriage. Hearing this, Samudradatta said, "My son, Jinadatta will not give his daughter to anyone other than a Jain. He will not give her in marriage." 

Then, they both became deceitful Shravakas and got married. After that, they both became Buddhists. Neela was also forbidden from going to her father's house. When this deception was revealed, Jinadatta said, "She is not my daughter. She must have fallen into a well or been taken away by Yama." 

Neela, though living in her father-in-law's house, was devoted to her husband, but she practiced the Jain religion in a separate house. Seeing this, and considering that due to association, hearing the words of the Dharmadevata, or in time, she would become a Buddhist, Samudradatta said to Neela, "Daughter, give food to the devotees of the Knowledgeable Ones for our sake." 

Then, she invited the devotees and, having prepared for them one by one, specially prepared food that was beneficial for life, she gave it to them to eat. After eating the food, they left, asking, "Where are the life-beneficial things?" They said, "Knowledgeable ones, know where they are. If you do not have knowledge, then you will vomit. The life-beneficial things are in your stomach." 

Then, they vomited, and the pieces of the life-beneficial things were seen. Then, the father-in-law's family became angry. Then, Sagaradatta's sister, out of anger, falsely accused Neela of adultery. This became known...

## Chapter Three

After that, she stood before the god, having gathered herself in the act of abandoning her body, saying, "My inclination is towards the liberation from faults, food, etc., and not towards anything else." Then, the city deity, disturbed, came to her at night and said, "Oh Great Ascetic! Do not abandon your life in this way. I will give you a dream of the king, the ministers, and the people of the city. The pegs of the city will be hammered in, and the Great Ascetic, with her left foot, will touch and lift them. And in the morning, they will touch your feet and say, 'You will lift them in this way,' and you will touch the pegs with your foot." Having said this, she showed the king and others the same dream. Then, the city deity, having hammered in the pegs of the city, stood there. In the morning, seeing the hammered pegs, the king and others, remembering the dream, caused the women of the city to be beaten with the pegs. Not a single woman was lifted by anyone. Afterwards, all of them were thrown and taken to her. By touching her feet, all the women were lifted from the pegs, became free from faults, and were worshipped by the king and others. Thus, she became the fourth in the vow.

## Chapter 51

Victory over the minor vow of non-possession, and the attainment of great worship.

## The Story

In the Kuru Jangala country, in the city of Hastinapur, in the Kuru dynasty, there was a king named Soma Prabha. His son, Jaya, was of limited possessions and his inclination was only towards his wife, Sulochana. Once, after hearing the story of the former Vidhyadhara, Jaya and Sulochana, who had come from their previous birth as the Vidhyadhara, Hiranya Dharma Prabhavati, went to Mount Meru to pay homage and devotion. After that, they went to Mount Kailash to worship the twenty-four Jinas established by Bharata. On that occasion, the celestial king, Saudharma Indra, praised Jaya for his vow of limited possessions in heaven. To test her, Rati Prabha Deva came there. Then, taking the form of a woman, she went to Jaya with four beautiful women and said, "Jaya, the king of the Vidhyadharas, who fought with you in Sulochana's Swayamvara, has a beautiful queen, young and full of knowledge, who is newly married. 

Page #392:
---------------------------
In the Ratnakaranḍaka, the story of the Śrāvaka is told.  A king named Jayena, hearing that a woman named Dhanashrī desired his kingdom and his life, said, "Do not speak thus, beautiful one!  Do not compare a woman of another man to my mother."  Even though she tried to seduce him, his mind did not waver.  He then revealed her true nature, praised her with fine clothes and other gifts, and sent her to heaven.  This is an example of the five great vows.  

The text then goes on to describe the faults of those who do not follow the five great vows, such as non-violence.  These include Dhanashrī, Satyaghoṣa, Tāpas, Āraksha, and the Śmashru-navnīta.  Dhanashrī, a wealthy merchant's wife, experienced much suffering due to her violence.  Satyaghoṣa, a priest, suffered due to his lies.  The Tāpas, an ascetic, suffered due to his theft.  The Āraksha, a guard, suffered due to his lack of livelihood.  The Śmashru-navnīta, a merchant, suffered due to his attachment to possessions.  These are all examples of the suffering that comes from not following the five great vows.  

The story of Dhanashrī is as follows:  In the country of Lāṭa, in the city of Bhṛgukakṣhapattana, there was a king named Lokapāla.  His minister, Dhanapāla, had a wife named Dhanashrī, who was constantly involved in killing living beings.  They had a daughter named Sundarī and a son named Guṇapāla.  Dhanashrī had a son named Kuṇḍala, whom she raised with great care.  After Dhanapāla died, Dhanashrī became even more involved in evil deeds.  When Guṇapāla grew up and became knowledgeable about the good and bad, Dhanashrī became suspicious of him.  She sent him to the forest to graze the cattle, saying, "You are getting married." 

Page #393:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three:

Those who said that Kunḍala was in a state of unrestrained violence, upon hearing this, Sundary told Guṇapāla, "Tonight, taking the cattle, go to the forest, and after sending you there, your mother will kill you with a dagger, so be careful." And Dhanashri, in the evening, told Guṇapāla, "Son, the dagger is a disfiguring weapon, so take the cattle and go to the forest." He took the cattle to the forest, covered a piece of wood with cloth, and hid himself. Kunḍala came and thinking it was Guṇapāla, struck the cloth-covered wood. Guṇapāla, seeing this, killed him with his sword. When Guṇapāla returned home, Dhanashri asked, "Where is Kunḍala?" He replied, "Kunḍala's story is written on this sword." Seeing the blood-stained arm, she killed him with the same sword. Seeing Dhanashri killing him, Sundary was killed with a pestle. When the commotion arose, the guards seized Dhanashri and brought her before the king. The king ordered her to be punished by being made to ride a donkey, having her nose and ears cut off, and other punishments. She died and went to hell, as is the fate of those who break their first vow. Satyaghoṣa, due to his untruthfulness, suffered much pain.

This is the story. In Jambudvipa, in the Bharata Kṣetra, in the city of Singhapura, there was a king named Singhāsena, his queen was Rāmadattā, and the priest was Śrībhūti. He was wearing a sacred thread and walking around. He said, "If I speak the truth, then this sacred thread will cut off my tongue." Thus, he was deceitful, and he got a second name, Satyaghoṣa. People trusted him and kept their valuables with him. He would give some of their valuables to others and keep some for himself. People were afraid to accuse him, and the king did not hear any accusations. Once, a merchant's son named Samudradattā came from Padmakhaṇḍapura, and keeping five priceless jewels with Satyaghoṣa, he went to the other shore to earn money. There, he earned money, but he was robbed, and his goods were scattered. 

Page #394:
---------------------------
In the Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra, a certain merchant from the seaport of Simhapura, desiring a ruby, approached Satyaghoṣa. Seeing him approaching like a beggar, Satyaghoṣa, in order to fulfill his purpose, told the people sitting nearby, "This man is a notorious thief. He has come here to steal the rubies. He will come, bow down, and say, 'O Satyaghoṣa, the priest! I have lost my wealth on a journey, and I have come to earn my livelihood. Therefore, please give me the rubies that I had entrusted to you. I need them to recover my lost wealth.' "

Hearing this, Satyaghoṣa, with deceit, told the people sitting nearby, "What I have said is true." They said, "You know this man is a thief. He will steal from us." Thus, they drove the merchant out of the house, fearing that he would steal.

The merchant, fearing for his life, went to the port and offered five rubies to Satyaghoṣa. Then, near the royal palace, he climbed a mango tree and spent six months there, offering prayers. Hearing this, Rāmadattā told King Simhasena, "Your Majesty, this man is not a thief." The king said, "Is it possible that Satyaghoṣa is a thief?" Rāmadattā replied, "Your Majesty, it is possible that he is a thief, because he always speaks in this way."

Hearing this, the king said, "If it is possible that Satyaghoṣa is a thief, then you should test him." Following the king's order, Rāmadattā asked Satyaghoṣa, who was coming to the palace to serve the king, "Why have you come at this late hour?" He replied, "My brother-in-law, a Brāhmaṇa, has arrived, and I am going to feed him. It is late because of the auspicious time." Rāmadattā said, "Wait a moment. I am very curious. Let us play dice." The king also arrived there and said, "Let us play."

Then, while playing dice, Rāmadattā, who was clever and cunning, whispered in Satyaghoṣa's ear, "The queen is standing behind you. Therefore, I am a thief."

## Chapter Three:

The princess sent a messenger to request the rubies. The messenger, a Brahmin woman, went and requested them. However, the Brahmin woman, having been previously forbidden, did not give them. The princess, upon her return, informed the Devikan that the Brahmin woman would not give them. Then, the Jitmudrika, with a token of recognition, was sent again. Still, the Brahmin woman did not give them. Then, the princess's maid, with a token of recognition, took the Yajnopaveeta (sacred thread) and showed it to the Brahmin woman. The Brahmin woman, frightened by the sight of the token and the Yajnopaveeta, gave the rubies to the princess. The princess then gave them to Ramadatta, who showed them to the king. The king, seeing many rubies, said to the Prahila, "Take your rubies, recognize them, and take them." The king took the rubies, and the king and Ramadatta accepted the son. Then, the king Satyaghoṣa asked, "Did you do this deed?" He replied, "O King, I did not do it. What reason would I have to do such a thing?" The king, very angry, gave him three punishments: "Eat three bowls of cow dung, or endure a fist blow, or give up all your wealth." The man, after considering, began to eat the cow dung. Unable to do so, he began to endure the fist blow. Unable to do so, he began to give up his wealth. Unable to do so, he began to eat cow dung again, then endure the fist blow. Thus, he experienced the three punishments and died. Due to his excessive greed, he was born as a snake in the royal treasury. Even there, he died and was reborn as a Darghisansari. This is the story of the second vow.

The ascetic, due to his theft, suffered much.

This is the story of the ascetic who, disguised as a Tapo (ascetic), lived in a cave in the Vatsya country, never touching the ground. He performed the Panchagni Sadhana (five-fire ritual) daily. He lived in Kausambi, having stolen from there. One day, hearing about the great gathering of people in the city, the king's Kottapala (chief guard) was told, "Hey...

## Chapter Three:

Early in the morning, they bound all of them and went. Then, someone said, "Oh, father! What is this that you are doing?" He replied, "What does a hungry person not do?" Thus, after his words in the morning, they bound his mouth and went. He, being bound, after they left, removed the binding from his mouth with his feet, devoured the children, and when they returned, again bound his mouth with his feet, becoming very emaciated and with an empty stomach, he remained. (3)

Then, while going through the city, I saw the fourth *Atikurkut*. In that city, a thief, assuming the form of an ascetic, carried a large stone on his head with his hands, and wandered through the city, day and night, saying, "I will strike the *Atikurkut* with this stone." He was called "The Striker" by all the devotees. He would look around in secluded places like pits, and seeing a lone person adorned with gold, he would strike him with the stone and take his wealth. (4)

Seeing these four *Atikurkuts*, I composed this verse:

A woman who touches a child, a Brahmin who harms grass,
A bird with a wooden beak in the forest, and a striker in the city.

Thus, after narrating this story, I became fearless. In the evening, I went to the vicinity of the Brahmin who was practicing *Shikya* asceticism. Even though he was being guarded by the ascetics' opponents, he became blind at night and fell there, remaining in one place. Those opponents, to test him at night, brought blades of grass, fingers, etc., near his eyes. He saw, but did not see. In the great night, in the cave, in the blind well, seeing the city's wealth being carried, seeing their eating and drinking, in the morning, he was being killed by the king, but was protected by the *Talara*. He then informed the *Shikya* ascetic about what he had seen at night.

The thief, being persuaded by the *Talara* with many pleas, died and went to hell, being the third *Vrata* of the *Atikurkut*.

The protector, due to the absence of *Abrahma* (non-violence), suffered pain.

## Chapter Three:

Holding a straw hut door with fire at his feet, he lay down at night and pondered: "With this ghee, I will become a wealthy merchant, then a king, then a great king, then a supreme king, and finally, a universal monarch. When I am lying on a bed in a seven-story palace, a beautiful woman will sit at my feet. Not knowing how to massage my feet, she will ask me, 'How do I massage your feet?' Out of love, I will kick her with my foot." Thinking this, he kicked the beautiful woman with his foot, which was filled with the desire to become a universal monarch. The beautiful woman fell down, and the ghee-soaked fire at the door flared up. Unable to escape the burning door, he was burned to death and went to hell. This is the consequence of the fifth vow without the measure of desire. || 18 ||

They say that these five minor vows, along with the abandonment of alcohol, meat, and honey, constitute eight fundamental virtues:

The five minor vows, along with the abandonment of alcohol, meat, and honey, are called the eight fundamental virtues of householders. || 20 ||

They say that there are eight fundamental virtues for householders. What are they? The eight fundamental virtues are the Jinas, who are the best of hearers. What are they? The five minor vows. Along with what? Along with the abandonment of alcohol, meat, and honey. || 20 ||

Having explained the five types of minor vows, they now explain the three types of virtuous vows:

... the vow of non-violence, the vow of non-stealing, and the vow of non-lying, as well as the measure of enjoyment and consumption. || 21 ||

They explain the virtuous vows. What are they? The virtuous vows. Who are they? The Aryas, who are worthy of being praised because of their virtues. They are the Tirthankaras, the gods, and so on. What is the vow of non-violence? The vow of non-violence. Not only this, but also the vow of... || 21 ||

## Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra

"Aṇḍavrata" is the restraint from the punishment of the meaning of the vow. Similarly, "Bhoga-upbhoga-parimāṇa" is the enjoyment of things like food, scent, and garlands, which are enjoyed again and again. "Upbhoga" is the enjoyment of things like clothes, ornaments, vehicles, and drinks. The "parimāṇa" of these two is the time limit, which can be for life.

Why are these three considered "guṇavratas"? Because they "anubṛṁhaṇa" - they increase the "guṇas". Which "guṇas"? The "aṣṭamūla-guṇas". ||21||

Describing the nature of "digvrata", it is said:

"Having calculated the "digvalaya", I will not go outside."

This "sankalpa" is for the removal of subtle sins and death. ||22||

What is "digvrata"? It is the "sankalpa". What is its form? It is in the form of "I will not go outside". What is done? "Digvalaya" is calculated, meaning the directions are defined. How? "Āmṛti" - until death. For what purpose? "Aṇupapa-vinivṛttyai" - for the removal of even subtle sins. ||22||

Regarding the calculation of "digvalaya", it is said:

"The boundaries are the sea, rivers, forests, mountains, villages, and yojanas." They say these are well-known boundaries for the ten directions. ||23||

They say these are boundaries. What are they? "Makarākara" etc. "Makarākara" is the sea, "sarit" are rivers like Ganga, "aṭavī" is the forest like Daṇḍakāraṇya, "giri" is the mountain like Sahya and Vindhya, "janapada" is the country like Vārāṭa and Vāpīṭaṭa, and "yojanas" are numbers like twenty, thirty, etc. What is special about these? They are well-known boundaries for the restraint of directions, both for the giver and the receiver. What are these boundaries for? For the ten directions, which are divided into ten parts. What is the purpose of these boundaries? For "pratisamhāre" - for the restraint of "I will not go beyond this point". ||23||

Thus, for those who observe "digvirati-vrata", what happens beyond the boundaries? 1. "Strījana-upasēvanādi" - sexual intercourse with women, etc. 2. "Jampatyādi" - jumping, etc. is observed.

## Chapter Three:  Those who maintain the Digvratas, abstaining from external minor sins, adopt the Anuvratas.

**24.** They adopt the Anuvratas. Which ones? The culmination of the five great vows. Who? Those who maintain (the Digvratas). Which ones? The Digvratas. Why do they adopt this culmination? Because of their abstention from minor sins, their avoidance of subtle, minor sins. Where? Externally. From what? From the established boundaries of the vow. **24.** Thus, He also states the ultimate reason for their culmination:

**25.**  They are characterized by the subtle nature of their rejection, their slowness, and their transformation into delusion of conduct. They are difficult to perceive due to their subtle nature and are considered for the great vow.  'Transformation into delusion of conduct' refers to the transformation into delusion of conduct in the form of emotions. 'Considered' means they are practiced. Why? For the sake of the great vow. What kind are they? 'Subtle nature' and 'difficult to perceive' means that even though they exist, they are difficult to perceive due to their subtle nature. Why are they difficult to perceive? They are 'slow' due to their extreme lack of urgency. Why are they slow? Because of the 'subtle nature of their rejection'. 'Rejection' refers to the coverings of rejection.  They are understood as material anger, pride, deceit, and greed.  These words are used in a limited sense, as they also exist in the form of names, like 'Bhima' etc.  Rejection is the restraint characterized by the avoidance of violence, etc., through the avoidance of violence, etc.  Those who cover this restraint are the coverings of rejection, material anger, etc.  When they arise, the soul is unable to perform the restraint of violence, etc.  Therefore, due to the subtle nature of material forms, etc., and the slow arising of anger, etc., the slowness of their emotional forms is established.

**26.**  Now, why are they considered for the great vow?  Because they become the very form of the great vow.  He says:

The abandonment of the later sins, such as violence, etc., through mind, speech, and body, through action, causation, and approval, is the great vow of the great ones. 

Page #402:
---------------------------
## Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra

"Tyāga" is the great vow (mahāvrata) again. What is the renunciation (tyāga)? It is of the "five" (pañcānām), namely, "violence and the rest" (hiṁsādīnām). What kind of "sins" (pāpānām)? Those that are the cause of the accumulation of sin (pāpoparjanahētubhūtānām). By what are they renounced (tyāga)? By "mind, speech, and body" (manovacaḥkāyaiḥ). By whom among these is the renunciation done? By "doing, causing to be done, and approving" (kṛtakāritānumodaiḥ). This is the meaning: renunciation of violence and the rest by mind, doing, causing to be done, and approving. Similarly, by speech and body. For whom among these is this renunciation a great vow (mahāvrata)? For those who are "great" (mahātām), those who have the qualities of carelessness and the rest (pramattādiguna sthānāvatinām), those who are of a special nature (viśiṣṭātmanām). || 26 ||

Now, the author describes the transgressions (aticārān) of the vow of non-direction (digvirativrata): transgression upwards, downwards, and sideways (ūrdhvādhastāttirgavyatipātāḥ), increase of territory (kṣetravṛddhiḥ), and forgetting (vismaranam).

The five transgressions (pañca manyante) of the vow of non-direction (digvirataratyāśā) are considered (abhyupgamante). Thus, due to ignorance (ajñānāt) or carelessness (pramādāt), transgression upwards, downwards, and sideways (ūrdhvādiśo'dhastādīśa stiyagdiśaśca vyatipātāḥ) are three special transgressions (viśeṣeṇatikramāṇi). Similarly, due to ignorance (ajñānāt) or carelessness (pramādāt), there is "increase of territory" (kṣetravṛddhiḥ), which is the determination of an excess of territory (kṣetrādhkyāvadhāraṇam). Similarly, there is "forgetting" (vismaranam) of the boundaries (mārȳādā) established by the vow of non-direction (digvirateḥ) for those who are "limited" (avadhīnām). || 27 ||

Now, the author explains the second vow of non-harmful conduct (anarthadaṇḍa), which is a vow of restraint (virati), which is a quality vow (guṇavrata):

"They know" (viduḥ) the vow of non-harmful conduct (anarthadaṇḍavrata). Who are they? "Those who are not ordinary among the vow-holders" (vratadharāṇāṇyaḥ), those who are not ordinary (apraṇyaḥ) among the vow-holders (vratadharāṇām), the Jinas (tīrthakaradevādyaḥ) and the rest, who are the main ones (pradhānabhūtāḥ). "Refraining" (viramaṇam) is the turning away (vyāvṛttiḥ). From what? From "those who are connected with sin" (sapapāyogaḥ), those who are connected with sin (pāpena saha yogaḥ sambandhaḥ pāpayogaḥ), those who are associated with sin (tena saha vartamānebhhyaḥ), from non-harmful conduct (anarthadaṇḍa) such as teaching sin (pāpopadeśādya). From what specific ones? From "those who are without purpose" (apārthikebhyaḥ), those who are without purpose (niṣprayojane bhyaḥ). How is there refraining from them? "From within the vow of non-direction" (abhyantaraṁ digavadheḥ), refraining from them in the same way as it is from within the vow of non-direction (digavadherabhyantaraṁ yathā bhavaty evaṁ tebhyo viramaṇam). Therefore, the vow of non-direction (digvirātatratādasya)

1. Now, the second vow of non-harmful conduct (anarthadaṇḍavrata) etc. (iti kha).

## Chapter Three: Distinction

**Distinction:**  Here, the restraint from teaching evil, etc., is external to the boundary, while the restraint from the non-virtuous punishments in the non-virtuous punishment restraint vow is internal to it. Now, what are those non-virtuous punishments from which there should be restraint? This is explained:

**63**
Five are the non-virtuous punishments: teaching evil, violence, taking, inattention, and bad listening.

They are called non-virtuous punishments by the holders of the non-virtuous punishments, like the Ganadhara Devas, because they are like punishments, being harmful to others through their evil mind, speech, and body. They do not hold them, hence they are called holders of the non-virtuous punishments. What are they? Non-virtuous punishments. How many? Five. How is it explained? "Teaching evil, etc." Teaching evil, violence, taking, inattention, and bad listening, these four, and heedless conduct, make five.

**29**

Now, the nature of teaching evil is explained:

**30**
The teaching of evil is to be remembered as the occurrence of stories about the suffering of animals, trade, violence, and undertaking, etc.

To be remembered, to be known. What? Teaching evil. Evil, the teaching that is the cause of earning evil. What kind? The occurrence of stories, the occurrence of stories about the suffering of animals, etc. What is special? The birth, the one that is born, the producer. Of whom? This is explained: "The suffering of animals, etc." The suffering of animals, like the taming of elephants, etc., trade, the work of merchants, buying and selling, etc., violence, the killing of living beings, undertaking, like agriculture, etc.

## Chapter 64:

**On the Conduct of the Shravaka**

**30.** The Jain scriptures state that the root of human suffering lies in **deceit** and **exploitation**.

**31.** **What is the meaning of "giving violence"?** The wise ones say that giving weapons like axes, swords, shovels, fire, horns, and chains is considered **giving violence**. 

**31.** **Who are these wise ones?** They are the **Ganadharas** and other **Devas**. **What is it?** It is **giving**. **To whom?** To those who are the **causes of violence**, the **instruments of violence**. **What are these causes?** They are **axes**, **swords**, **shovels**, **fire**, **weapons** like knives and clubs, **horns**, **poison**, **chains**, and so on.

**32.** **Now, let us explain the nature of "unwholesome thought".** The wise ones of the **Jina's teachings** state that **unwholesome thought** is the contemplation of **killing**, **binding**, **cutting**, **hatred**, and **lust** for another's spouse.

**32.** **Who are these wise ones?** They are the **discerning** ones. **Where?** In the **Jina's teachings**. **What is it?** It is **wholesome thought**, **contemplation**. **Of what?** Of **killing**, **binding**, **cutting**, and so on. **From what?** From **hatred**. **Not only from hatred, but also from lust**. **Of what?** Of **another's spouse**.

**33.** **Now, let us describe the nature of "unwholesome hearing".** Unwholesome hearing is the contamination of the mind by **falsehood**, **deceit**, **pride**, **hatred**, **lust**, **anger**, and **delusion**. 

**Note:**

* **Shravaka:** A lay follower of Jainism.
* **Ganadhara:** A disciple of Mahavira, the last Tirthankara.

## Chapter Three: 'Duḥśruti Becomes'

What is 'śruti'? It is hearing. Of which 'avadhīna' scriptures, what do those who 'kaluṣayataṃ' (pollute) do? What is that 'cetah'? It means a mind filled with anger, delusion, greed, and avarice. Who does this? It says, "Ārambhetyādi" - Ārambha (beginning), Kṛṣi (agriculture), etc., Sangha (association), Parigraha (acquisition), and the exposition of these two, Vārtā (business), Nīti (policy) are established. "Kṛṣiḥ Paśupālyaṃ Vāṇijyaṃ ca Vārtā" (Agriculture, animal husbandry, and commerce are business) - as it is stated. Sāhasa (courage) is also established in heroic tales as an extraordinary act. Mithyātvam (falsehood) is done by scriptures that contradict the truth, such as "Advaita Kṣaṇika" (non-dualistic momentary), etc. Dveṣa (hatred) is established by scriptures that speak of hatred, and Rāga (attachment) is established by scriptures that speak of subjugation. Mada (pride) is known from scriptures like "Brāhmaṇo Gurur" (The Brāhmaṇa is the teacher), etc. Madana (lust) is excellent, as it is derived from scriptures like "Ratiguṇa Vilāsa Patākā" (The flag of love, qualities, and enjoyment), etc. By doing these things, the hearing of scriptures becomes duḥśruti (bad hearing). ||33||

Now, describing the nature of carelessness, it says:

"Kṣiti Salila Dahan Pavana Ārambhaṃ Vipalaṃ Vanaspati Chhedaṃ |
Saraṇaṃ Sāraṇam Api Ca Pramāda Chayo Prabhāṣante || 34 ||"

'Prabhāṣante' - they establish. What? 'Pramāda Chayo'. What is that? It says, "Kṣitityādi". Kṣiti (earth), Salila (water), and Dahan (fire), their Ārambha (beginning) is characterized by digging the earth, pouring water, igniting fire, and creating wind. What is special? 'Vipalaṃ' - fruitless. Similarly, 'Vanaspati Chhedaṃ' - fruitless cutting of trees. Not only this, but 'Saraṇaṃ' - 'Sāraṇam Api Ca' - Saraṇa itself is fruitless wandering, Sāraṇa is another fruitless journey. ||34||

Thus, having established the Anartha Danda Virati Vrata (vow of abstaining from harmful actions and punishments), now it speaks of its transgressions:

"Kandarpa Kautkucyaṃ Maukharyaṃ Ati Prasādhanaṃ Pañca |
Asamīkṣya Ca Adhikaraṇaṃ Vyātītayo'nartha Danda Kṛt Virateḥ || 35 ||"

1. Even without a purpose, cutting trees, digging the ground, watering, and killing are considered carelessness. ||

## The Ratnakaranda Shravaka-chara:

**The transgressions of the Shravaka-chara are those that are committed by those who are free from the punishment of wrongdoing.**  Why? Because those who are free from the punishment of wrongdoing are those who do not commit the sin of giving bad advice, etc. How many are there? Five. How so? It is said:

* **Kandarpa:**  A playful use of words, mixed with laughter, with a focus on jesting, arising from desire.
* **Prahasa:**  Laughter, jesting, and playful actions.
* **Bhandi:**  A playful use of words, accompanied by playful bodily actions.
* **Maukhya:**  Boldness, excessive talkativeness.
* **Asamikshya-adhikaranam:**  The fifth is the undertaking of an action without considering its consequences. This means undertaking an action without considering its purpose, without careful deliberation, and without considering the consequences of the action.

**Now, to explain the nature of enjoyment and the measure of enjoyment, it is said:**

**The measure of enjoyment and the measure of the enjoyment of enjoyment is the enumeration of the objects of the senses.**  Even for those who are worthy, this enumeration is for the sake of reducing the intensity of their desires and attachments.

**What is the measure of enjoyment and the enjoyment of enjoyment?** It is the enumeration of the objects of the senses. **Of whom?** Of those who are worthy, who are capable of achieving their desired goals, or of those who are worthy and are bound by their attachments. **Why is this enumeration done?** It is done to reduce the intensity of their desires and attachments. **Of whom?** Of those who are attached to the objects of their senses, who are passionate about them, and who are consumed by their desires. **When?** When there is a limit to the amount of the objects of the senses.

**Now, one might wonder, what is enjoyment and what is the enjoyment of enjoyment, and what is the measure of this enjoyment?**  It is said:

**Enjoyment is that which is to be enjoyed and then abandoned. The enjoyment of enjoyment is that which is to be enjoyed again and again. The enjoyment of enjoyment is the objects of the five senses, such as food, clothing, etc.**

**There are five types of enjoyment:**

1. **Trasa-ghata:**  Enjoyment that causes fear and harm.
2. **Pramada:**  Enjoyment that leads to carelessness.
3. **Bahuvadhana:**  Enjoyment that leads to excessive attachment.
4. **Nishta:**  Enjoyment that leads to attachment to the object of enjoyment.
5. **Anupasavya:**  Enjoyment that is not conducive to spiritual progress.

**Honey and meat should always be avoided, as they lead to fear and harm.**  **Wine should be avoided, as it leads to confusion about what is right and wrong, and therefore should be avoided to prevent carelessness.** 

Page #407:
---------------------------
## Chapter Three

**67.** The objects of the five senses are 'Panchendriyaṇāmāya'.  'BhuKtva' (having enjoyed) should be abandoned, that enjoyment is like food, flowers, fragrance, and ointments.  'Upbhoga' (enjoyment) is that which is to be enjoyed again after having been enjoyed before, like clothes, ornaments, etc.  Clothing is a garment.  || 37 ||

He says that enjoyment in the form of liquor, etc., is also to be abandoned by those who observe the minor vows, because it is the cause of the killing of living beings.

**38.**  Honey, flesh, and liquor are to be abandoned for the sake of avoiding the killing of living beings.  Liquor is to be abandoned by those who have taken refuge in the feet of the Jinas.  What is to be abandoned?  'Kshaudra' is honey.  Similarly, 'Pishita' is flesh.  For what purpose?  'Trasahatipariharaṇārtha' - for the sake of avoiding the killing of living beings, the killing of those who have two senses, etc.  Similarly, 'Madya cha' (liquor) is to be abandoned.  For what purpose?  'Pramada pariharaṇaye' - for the sake of avoiding delusion, the absence of discrimination between mother and wife.  By whom is this to be abandoned?  'Sharaṇam upayātaiḥ' - by those who have taken refuge.  Who?  'Jina charanau' - by the Shravakas, meaning that it is to be abandoned by them.  || 38 ||

He says that this too is to be abandoned by them:

**39.**  'Avahēya' (to be abandoned) are radishes, ginger, and turmeric, which are of little fruit and cause much harm to many living beings.  'Avahēya' is to be abandoned.  What is it?  'Mūlaka' is radish.  Similarly, 'Shṛngavērāṇi' are ginger.  What kind?  'Ārdrāṇi' - uncooked.  Similarly, 'Navanīta nimbakusuma' is an example of all kinds of flowers.  'Kaitaka' is a kind of flower, 'Gudharā' is another, and so on.  All these are to be abandoned.  Why?  'Alpāphala bahuvidhātā' - because they have little fruit and cause much harm to many living beings.  They have little fruit and cause much harm, therefore they are to be abandoned.  || 39 ||

- He says that even if it is like this, it is to be abandoned: ... 1  Flowers like Ketki and Arjuna, which are the abode of many living beings, and ginger, radish, turmeric, neem flowers, etc., which are called 'anantakāya' (having infinite bodies), are to be avoided because they cause much harm and have little fruit.  It is better to avoid them. 

Page #408:
---------------------------
The **Ratnakaranḍaka** states that a Śrāvaka should abandon any practice that is considered undesirable, and also any practice that is not conducive to spiritual progress. This abandonment, motivated by a desire to avoid the undesirable and to pursue the conducive, constitutes a vow. (40)

"Undesirable" refers to practices that cause harm, such as stomach aches, and are not in accordance with one's nature. "Not conducive" refers to practices that are not beneficial for spiritual progress, such as consuming cow urine, curdled milk, conch powder, betel nut, saliva, urine, feces, phlegm, etc. These practices are considered unsuitable for those who are striving for liberation. (40)

This abandonment is motivated by a desire to avoid the undesirable and to pursue the conducive. This desire-driven avoidance is what constitutes a vow. (40)

There are two types of vows: **niyama** and **yama**. (41)

**Niyama** is a vow that is practiced for a limited period of time, while **yama** is a vow that is practiced for one's entire life. (41)

**Niyama** and **yama** are both established through the avoidance of **bhoga** and **upabhoga**. (41)

**Bhoga** refers to the enjoyment of material possessions, while **upabhoga** refers to the enjoyment of sensory experiences. (41)

**Niyama** is characterized by a limited period of time for the avoidance of **bhoga** and **upabhoga**. (41)

**Yama** is characterized by a lifelong avoidance of **bhoga** and **upabhoga**. (41)

The **Ratnakaranḍaka** provides examples of **niyama** in the context of food, transportation, sleep, bathing, purification, adornment, flowers, betel nut, clothing, jewelry, love, music, and singing. (42)

It is important to note that even desirable things, such as beautiful clothes, elaborate hairstyles, and ornate jewelry, should be abandoned if they are not conducive to spiritual progress. (42)

This is because a vow is not merely a matter of following rules, but rather a commitment to a higher purpose. (42)

## Chapter Three:

**69**

... Today, daytime, night, fortnight, month, or season. ... This is the rule of rejection by time limitation. ||43|| - Couple. The rule is. What is it? Rejection. By what? By time limitation. Showing the same time limitation, he says - Today, etc. Today, by the time limitation of the present moment, hour, etc., rejection. Similarly, daytime, etc. Night, or night. Fortnight, etc. Month, etc. Season, etc., two months. Season, etc., six months. Thus, rejection by time limitation. In what? He says - Food, etc. Food, and vehicle, like a chariot, and bed, like a couch, and bath, and sacred body-dye, and sacred body-dye, and sacred body-dye, like saffron, etc. This is an example, because the special characteristic of sacred body-dye is the removal of defects, and therefore medicinal body-dye, etc., is rejected. Flowers, etc., are the objects of these. Similarly, betel nut, and clothing, and cloth, and ornaments, like necklaces, and Cupid, and sexual service, and music, and singing, dancing, and instruments, and singing alone, without dancing and instruments, and in these objects, the rejection by time limitation, like today, etc., is the rule. ||42-43||

The excess of the measure of enjoyment and non-enjoyment is now described: Object, aversion, remembrance, excessive eagerness, thirst, experience. Five excesses of the measure of enjoyment and non-enjoyment are described. ||44|| - The measure of enjoyment and non-enjoyment, its excesses, five are described. What are they? He says - Object, etc. Object itself is poison for beings, because it causes burning, etc., and therefore aversion to them, the absence of the absence of aversion, aversion, meaning respect. The experience of objects is for the sake of counteracting the pain of objects, therefore, even when that counteraction has arisen, the respect, like talking, embracing, etc., is an excess, because it is the cause of excessive attachment. Remembrance 

Page #410:
---------------------------
7
In the Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra, even though there is a reaction to the experience of the three, there is still excessive conduct due to the objects being means of beauty (k) and pleasure, and due to imitation being the cause of excessive attachment. Excessive eagerness and excessive greed, even though there is a reaction to them, still repeatedly desire to experience them again. Excessive thirst is the desire to obtain excessive possessions, future enjoyment, and enjoyment. Excessive experience is when, even at the appointed time, one experiences enjoyment and enjoyment, one experiences it with excessive attachment, not with the reaction of pain, hence excessive conduct. || 44 ||
Thus ends the third chapter of the Upāsakādhyayanaṭīkā composed by Prabhācandra, based on the work of Samantabhadra Svāmī. || 3 || 

Page #411:
---------------------------
The fourth is the vow of education.
Now, to describe the form of the vow of education, it is said:
A limited area, or a Samayika, or a fast, or a vow of non-violence.
These four are the refined vows of education. || 1 ||
The refined vows have been explained. Which ones? The vows of education. How many? Four. Why? Because of the existence of four types, such as limited area, etc. The word "or" here indicates a combination of different types. The author himself will describe the characteristics of a limited area, etc. || 1 ||
There, the characteristics of a limited area are:
A limited area is when there is a restriction of time for a particular area.
It is the restriction of a large area for those who observe the minor vows every day. || 2 ||
A limited area is when there is a restriction of space, even within a limited area, for a fixed period of time. This is the vow of education called a limited area. What is this? Restriction. Of what? Of an area. What kind of area? A large area, a vast area. By what? By a restriction of time, such as a day, etc. How? Every day. Of whom? Of those who observe the minor vows, those who have small vows, meaning the lay followers. || 2 ||
Now, what is the limit of a limited area? It is said:
The wise ones remember the boundary of a limited area as being the houses, the villages, the fields, the rivers, and the places of pilgrimage. || 3 || 

Page #412:
---------------------------
## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar 

**66**

The ancient teachers like Ganadhardeva, who are well-versed in penance, remember the boundaries and explain them. In the word "boundaries", the sixth case ending (षष्ठी) is used, meaning "of whom". Whose boundaries are these? The boundaries are of houses, villages, and fields. The boundary of a village is a fort (कटक). Similarly, the boundary of a field, river, and a distance of seven yojanas is a forest (वन). These boundaries are for the **Deshavakashika** who has taken the vow of **Deshanivritti**.

**72**

Explaining the limits of time and wealth, it is said:

> "Year, season, solstice, month, four months, fortnight, and constellation - these are the limits of time for the **Deshavakashika**, as said by the wise." (4)

The wise, like Ganadhardeva, explain the time limit, the time boundary, for the **Deshavakashika**. What is it? It is said: "Year, etc." - meaning, "I should stay in this place for a year, or for a season, or for a month, or for four months, or for a fortnight, or until this constellation (as determined by the moon or the sun)." After fulfilling these conditions, what happens? It is said:

> "By abandoning the five great sins, other than the gross ones, beyond the boundaries, the **Deshavakashika** establishes the great vows." (5)

The great vows are established, meaning they are implemented. By whom? By the **Deshavakashika**, not only by the **Digviraati**, but also by the **Deshavakashika**. Why? Because of the abandonment of the five great sins, other than the gross ones. The five great sins are those that are characterized by violence, etc. The **Deshavakashika** abandons these sins completely. Who? The **Deshavakashika** who is beyond the boundaries. The boundaries are the "end-dharmas" (अन्ताधर्मा) like houses, etc., and the specific periods like a year, etc. Beyond these boundaries, in that part, the **Deshavakashika** now shows the transgressions. It is said:

> "Sending a message, bringing something, showing money, revealing a person, and throwing something - these are the five transgressions of the **Deshavakashika**." (6) 

Page #413:
---------------------------
## Chapter Four:

73
... Excesses, transgressions. Five are declared, stated. What are they? He says, "Sending" etc. In a delimited territory, for one who is situated there, to do this outside, this is the deployment, sending. Outside the delimited territory, for those who are doing work, such as digging, this is the word. Outside that territory, for the purpose of bringing this, this is the command, bringing. In the delimited territory, for one who is situated there, to do work outside the territory, for those who are doing work, this is the display of their own form, the manifestation of form. For them, the falling of clods of earth etc., the throwing of particles. ||6||. Thus, the teaching vow in the form of space and time has been explained. Now, to explain the Samayika form, he says:

"Liberation from the time, liberated, after the five, in their entirety.
Everywhere, the Samayikas praise the Samayika by name." ||7||

The Samayika name is clearly praised, stated. Who are they? The Samayikas, those who find the time, the arrival, they are the Samayikas, like the Ganadhara Devas. What is it? Liberation, release, avoidance, that is the Samayika. Whose liberation? Of the five evils, violence etc. How? Liberation from the time, liberation from the time as described, liberation from the time that is all-pervading, liberation from the time that is taken as a rule, until the end, that is the meaning. How is their liberation? In their entirety, completely, not again from the territory. Everywhere, in the other part of the territory, by this, the difference from the space and time vow is stated. ||7|| ... The word "time" that is stated here, to explain its meaning, he says:

"The binding of the hair on the head, the binding of the fist, the binding of the garment, the binding of the mud.
Those who know the time, the time-knowers, know this as the time." ||8||

The time-knowers, those who know the scriptures. They know the time. What is it? The binding of the hair on the head, the binding of the fist, the binding of the garment, the binding of the mud. The word "binding" is connected to each of these. They know the binding of the hair on the head, the time of binding. Similarly, the binding of the fist, the binding of the garment, the knot of the cloth, the binding of the mud. 

Page #414:
---------------------------
## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar

**8.** They know the time for the **Samayika** (voluntary observance) - the time for sitting with the body upright, the time for standing with the body upright, the time for sitting down, or the time for simply being in a seated position.

**9.**  Thus, in this time, the **Samayika** is a complete cessation of the five types of sins. It is said that this cessation should be increased progressively. How?

* The **Samayika** should be observed in solitude, free from distractions, in forests, in houses, or in temples, with a clear mind. 

* It should be observed and increased. What? The **Samayika**. Where? In solitude, a place free from women, animals, and the sick. How? Free from distractions, meaning free from mental agitation, pollution of the mind, or cold winds and other obstacles. In such solitude, where? In forests, in houses, and in temples, free from the noise of birds, mountains, and caves. By whom should it be observed? By one with a clear mind, a mind that is not distracted, or by one who has a clear mind and observes it with that mind.

**10.** In such places, how should it be observed? It is said:

* The **Samayika** should be observed with the cessation of worldly activities and mental distractions, and with the cessation of internal mental fluctuations. It should be observed with fasting or with one meal.

**11.** When should it be observed? It is said:

* The **Samayika** should be observed daily, diligently, and with mindfulness, as it is the cause for the completion of the five vows. 

Page #415:
---------------------------
## Chapter Four:

75
It should be understood and practiced. What? Samayika. When? Every day, not just on festival days. How? As prescribed, without transgressing the established form. How? Meaning, without being distracted by fire, army, or other obstacles. And with full attention, without being distracted by anything else. Why should it be understood in this way? Because it is the cause for the fulfillment of the five vows. For the five vows, including non-violence, etc., their fulfillment, their completeness, their being in the form of a great vow, is caused by the practice of Samayika as described. For during the time of Samayika practice, even the minor vows become great vows. Therefore, it is the cause. || 11 ||

Supporting this, the text says:

In Samayika, there are no attachments, no possessions at all.
Like a monk adorned with a robe, he then attains the state of a renunciant. || 12 ||

In Samayika, in the state of Samayika. There are none, they do not exist. What? Attachments, possessions. How? With beginnings, including agriculture, etc. How many? All, "external, internal, sentient, non-sentient, etc." From that very moment, he goes, he attains. What? The state of a renunciant, the state of being a renunciant. Who is this? A householder, a lay follower. When? In the state of Samayika. Like whom? Like a monk adorned with a robe, adorned with a robe, due to the influence of a calamity, and he, that monk, is like that. || 12 ||

Similarly, those who have accepted Samayika, what else do they do? The text says:

They endure cold, heat, bites, and calamities, and remain silent. Those who have accepted Samayika are steadfast in their practice, unwavering in their vows. || 13 ||

"Steadfast" means enduring. Who are they? Those who have accepted Samayika, those who have accepted Samayika. What are they distinguished by? They are unwavering in their vows, steadfast in their concentration, or they do not abandon their vows. Similarly, they remain silent, even in the face of suffering, not uttering a word, like a bee. Who endures? The text says, "cold, etc." Cold, heat, etc. 

Page #416:
---------------------------
## Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra:

**Verse 13:**

The suffering caused by the ten types of tormentors, and the endurance of that suffering, is not only for the sake of that suffering itself, but also for the sake of overcoming the afflictions, both human and divine, as well as those of the animal realm.

**Verse 14:**

Those who are observing the Samayika should contemplate the nature of samsara and liberation in this way: "I am dwelling in this existence, which is without refuge, inauspicious, impermanent, painful, and not the Self." ... "Liberation is the opposite of this," they should contemplate during the Samayika.

**Explanation:**

* **Existence:**  Without refuge (no protection from evil), inauspicious (caused by evil actions), impermanent (temporary), painful (source of suffering), and not the Self (not the true nature of the soul).
* **Liberation:** The opposite of existence, characterized by refuge, auspiciousness, permanence, happiness, and the true Self.

**Verse 15:**

The five transgressions of the Samayika are:

* **Misconduct of speech, body, and mind:**  These are the three types of misconduct.
* **Disregard:** Lack of enthusiasm.
* **Forgetfulness:** Lack of focus. 

**Explanation:**

These transgressions are described as "manifest" (vyajyante), meaning they are clearly evident and should be avoided.

**Further Explanation:**

The text then goes on to explain the nature of the vows of fasting and medication (proṣadhopavāsa), which are part of the Śrāvaka's practice. 

Page #417:
---------------------------
## Chapter Four:

The **proṣadha** fast should be known on the eighth day of the fortnight. 
The rejection of the four things to be used (**catur-abhyavahāryāṇām**) should be done with good intentions. (16)

The **proṣadha** fast should be known again. When? On the fourteenth day of the fortnight, not only on the eighth day. What is meant by the term **proṣadha** fast? Rejection. Of what? Of the four things to be used (**catur-abhyavahāryāṇām**). The four are food, drink, edibles, and lickables. These are to be used and eaten. What? The rejection of these on the eighth and fourteenth days. It says - always, at all times. With what? With the intention of fulfilling desires (**sadeccha**), not with the intention of earning money or other worldly things. (16)

What should be done by one who is fasting on the day of the fast? It says:
One should avoid the five sins, adornment, business, perfumes and flowers, singing and dancing, bathing, applying collyrium, and nasal drops. (17)

Having avoided these, what should be done on that day? It says:
One should drink the nectar of Dharma with thirst, and make others drink it. One should be devoted to knowledge and meditation, and be a true devotee. (18)

One who is fasting should drink the nectar of Dharma. Dharma is indeed the nectar, as it is the source of nourishment for all beings. One should drink it. With what? With the ears. How? With thirst, with desire, not out of compulsion. One should make others drink it. One who has understood the nature of Dharma should make others who have not understood it drink the nectar of Dharma. One should be devoted to knowledge and meditation. One should be devoted to knowledge, and be steadfast in the twelve **anuprekshā** meditations.

Now, describing the characteristics of Proshdha Upavasa, he says:

**Chaturahara Visarjanam Upavasa Proshdha Sakrid Bhukti. Sa Proshdha Upavasa Yad Uposhyarambha Acharati || 19 ||**

* The four types of food are: Asana, Pana, Khady, and Lehya. Asana is food like moong, Pana is drink like buttermilk, Khady is sweets like modak, and Lehya is sticky food like rab. The abandonment of these four is called Upavasa. 
* Proshdha is the practice of eating only once a day on the day of fasting. The one who performs the Upavasa and then starts eating only once a day on the day of Parana is called Proshdha Upavasa. || 19 ||

**Atha Ke Asya Atichara Ityaha:**

* Grahana Visarga Astarana Anyadrusht Amrusht Anudara Smara Ne, Yat Proshdha Upavasa Vyatilaghana Panchakam Taddidam || 20 ||

* The five transgressions of Proshdha Upavasa are: Grahana, Visarga, Astarana, Anyadrusht, and Amrusht. These are explained in the previous part. 
* Grahana, Visarga, and Astarana are three. How are they? Anyadrusht and Amrusht are those which are not seen or touched. Seen means seeing with the eyes whether there are living beings or not. Touch means cleaning with water or a cloth. These two are not present in those things which are not seen or touched. 
* In this, the one who is suffering from hunger takes things like food, water, flowers, and clothes, which are not seen or touched. 
* Similarly, the one who excretes urine or stool on the ground which is not seen or touched. 
* Similarly, the one who spreads a bed on a place which is not seen or touched.

There are three (types of) disrespect and two (types of) forgetfulness. Thus, disrespect due to hunger and forgetfulness due to being overwhelmed by many things are the characteristics of disrespect and forgetfulness. || 20 || Now, describing the nature of the vow of conduct (Vyayavritta) in terms of its characteristics, he says:
Giving (Dana) is conduct (Vyayavritta) for the sake of Dharma, for the one who has tapas as wealth, for the one who is a repository of virtues. It is an offering without expecting any return, without any expectation of service or assistance, with wealth. || 21 ||
Even giving food, etc., is called conduct (Vyayavritta). To whom is the giving? To the one who has tapas as wealth, for whom tapas is wealth. To whom specifically? To the one who is a repository of virtues, the one who is the abode of the right vision of virtues, etc. And to the one who is without a storehouse of wealth (bhavadravya). For what purpose? For the sake of Dharma, for the purpose of Dharma. What is the special characteristic of that giving? It is an offering without expecting any return, without any expectation of service or assistance. Service is a return, assistance is the use of mantras and tantras, etc., for the purpose of reciprocation. There is no expectation of these. That giving is with wealth, with wealth like the means of Dharma, etc. || 21 || Not only giving is called conduct (Vyayavritta), but also the removal of calamities, the carrying of the feet, and the affection for virtues.
Conduct (Vyayavritta) is any service that is done by the restrained ones. || 22 ||
Calamities are various kinds of calamities born from diseases, etc. The removal of these, the special removal, the alleviation, that is conduct (Vyayavritta). Similarly, the carrying of the feet, the massaging of the feet. Why? Because of affection for virtues, because of devotion, that is the meaning. Not because of transaction, or because of the expectation of visible results. Not only this is conduct (Vyayavritta), but also any service that is done by the restrained ones, from the whole country to the end of the vow, whatever the amount of service, whatever the amount of benefit, all that is called conduct (Vyayavritta). || 22 ||
Now, what is giving (Dana) called? To this, he says:
Giving is considered to be for the Aryas who have attained the nine virtues, who have the seven virtues, who are pure, who have abandoned the beginning of evil. || 23 || 

Page #420:

## Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar

**Giving** is to be done. What is it? **Understanding**, **respect**, and **honour**. To whom? To **Aryas**, **munis** with qualities like **right vision**. What kind of **Aryas**? Those who have **abandoned the five types of killing**. It is said:

> **"Khandani, peshani, chulli, udakumbha, pramarjani. Pancha suna grihasthasyaten moksam na gachchati."** (13)

**Khandani** (mortar), **peshani** (pestle), **chulli** (stove), **udakumbha** (water pot), **pramarjani** (broom). Those who have abandoned **suna** (killing) and **arambha** (farming) etc. are free from them. 

How should **understanding** be done? With **seven qualities**.

> **"Shraddha, tusti, bhakti, vijnana, alubdhata, kshama, satyam. Yasyaite sapta gunastam dataram prasansanti."**

With these **seven qualities**, the giver should give. By what? By **nine merits**.

> **"Padighamucchatthanam, padodayamaccanam cha panam cha. Manavapanakayasuddhi, esanasuddhi ya navavihang punnam."** (23)

By these **nine merits**, which are the causes of **merit**.

Showing the result of giving in this way, it is said:

> **"Grihakarmnaapi nichintam karma vimarti khalu grihaviamuktanam. Atithinaam pratipuja rudhiramalam dhavati vari."** (24)

**Vimarti** (destroys). **Khalu** (indeed). What is it? **Karma** in the form of **sin**. How is it? Even if it is **accumulated**, **nourished**, or **strong**. By what? By **grihakarma** (household work) with **careless actions**. Who is the **doer**? **Pratipuja** (giving) to **guests**. Who are they? Those who have **no fixed abode**. To support this meaning, an example is given: **"Rudhiramalam dhavati vari"** (blood stains are washed away by water). **Alam** (enough) word.

## Chapter Four

**81**

The meaning is this: Just as pure water washes away dirt and impurities, so too does charity wipe away sin. || 24 ||

Now, regarding the nine types of acceptance (like gifts, etc.), what are the fruits of each? This is explained:

- High lineage comes from prostration, enjoyment from charity, worship from devotion, and beautiful form from devotion. Fame comes from praise, and wealth from ascetics. || 25 ||

From prostration (to the worthy), one attains a high lineage. From charity, one attains enjoyment, which is characterized by purity of vision. From devotion, one attains worship everywhere, which is characterized by acceptance of gifts, etc. From devotion, one attains a beautiful form, which is characterized by special faith born from love for the qualities of the worthy. From praise, one attains fame everywhere, which is characterized by the ocean of knowledge, etc. || 25 ||

One might wonder how such a specific and great fruit can be attained from a small act of charity. To dispel this doubt, it is said:

- Even a small act of charity, given at the right time and to the right recipient, bears many fruits, like a banyan seed planted in the earth. || 26 ||

Even a small act of charity, given at the right time, to the right recipient, bears many fruits, beautiful in form, and characterized by enjoyment and possessions. How? It bears the fruit of shade and wealth. Where there is shade, there is greatness, and where there is greatness, there is wealth. To support this meaning, the example of the banyan seed is given: Just as a small banyan seed planted in fertile soil bears many fruits, so too does a small act of charity bear many fruits. How? It bears the fruit of shade and wealth. Shade protects from the sun, and its wealth is its abundance. || 26 ||

Such charity, which bears these fruits, is of four types:

- Charity in the form of food, medicine, tools, and shelter is said to be of four types, like a four-sided square. || 27 ||

## The Ratnakarandaśrāvakācāra on Giving (Vayyāvṛttya)

The Ratnakarandaśrāvakācāra discusses giving (Vayyāvṛttya) and explains how it is fourfold (caturātmatvena) and in four ways (caturprakāratvena). What are these? They are the four kinds of wise people (caturāsraḥ paṇḍitāḥ).  

The text then describes these four kinds of giving, starting with food (āhāre) and so on:

> Food (āhāras) includes things like food and drink (bhaktashanādi), and medicine (auṣadham) includes things that are beneficial (vyāvisphēṭakam). Giving both of these is considered giving. Not only these two, but also giving things like tools (upakarana) and shelter (āvāsa) is also considered giving. Tools (upakarana) include things like tools for knowledge (jñānopakaraṇādi), and shelter (āvāsa) includes things like a place to live (vasatikādi). || 27 ||

The text then explains what kind of giving is given by whom:

> The four kinds of giving (caturvikālpasya) are exemplified by Śrīṣeṇa, Vṛṣabha, Sena, Kauṇḍeśa, Śūkaratha, and Dṛṣṭānta. These are to be considered as examples of the four kinds of giving (caturvikālpasya). || 28 ||

The text then explains these examples:

> In the case of giving food (āhāradāna), Śrīṣeṇa is the example. His story is as follows: In the city of Ratnasamcayapura in the Malaya country, there was a king named Śrīṣeṇa, and his two queens were Simhananditā and Aninditā. Their sons were Indra and Upeṇḍra, respectively. In the same city, there was a Brāhmaṇa named Satyaki, his wife was Jambū, and their daughter was Satyabhāmā. In the city of Pāṭaliputra, there was a Brāhmaṇa named Rudrabhaṭṭa who taught the Vedas to students. His servant's son, Kapila, was very intelligent and learned the Vedas secretly. He became proficient in the Vedas, but Rudrabhaṭṭa was angry and expelled him from Pāṭaliputra. Kapila then put on the sacred thread (yajñopavīta) and went to Ratnasamcayapura, pretending to be a Brāhmaṇa. Satyaki saw him, and seeing that he was learned in the Vedas and handsome, thought that he would be a suitable husband for Satyabhāmā. So, she was given to him. But when the time for sexual intercourse came, Satyabhāmā saw that he was not of noble birth and thought that he would not be a good husband. She was filled with sorrow and remained silent. At this time, Rudrabhaṭṭa was on a pilgrimage and came to Ratnasamcayapura. Kapila bowed to him and took him to his own house, where he gave him food and other things. He told Satyabhāmā and everyone else that this was his father. One day, Satyabhāmā gave Rudrabhaṭṭa special food and a lot of gold, and she fell at his feet. 

(This is just a partial translation of the text. The full translation would be much longer.)

## Chapter Four

O Father! Even a speck of your virtue is not present in Kapila, so tell me the truth, is he your son or not? Then he said, "Daughter, he is the son of my servant." Hearing this, she became disgusted and thinking that she would be forced to approach me, she took refuge in the great goddess Singhanandita. She recognized her as her daughter. 

Thus, once King Srishena, with great devotion, gave a gift to the Muni, Arkkimitagati, according to the proper procedure. As a result of that gift, he was born in the realm of enjoyment with the king. Due to the approval of that, Satyabhama was also born there. That king, Srishena, because of the first cause of the gift, became Shantinatha Tirthankara in the lineage. This is the result of giving food.

The example of Vrishabhasena is for giving medicine. Her story is as follows: In the Janapada country, in the city of Kaveri, there was a king, Ugrasen, a wealthy merchant, his wife Dhanashri, and their daughter Vrishabhasena. Her nurse was named Rupavati. Once, Vrishabhasena saw a dog, afflicted with disease, fallen and lying in the bathwater, and then healthy. She thought, "Daughter, the reason for this health is the bathwater." Then, her nurse told her own mother, who was suffering from a twelve-year-old eye disease, to wash her eyes with that water for one day as a test. When her vision became bright, the nurse became famous in that city for curing all diseases. 

One day, the minister Ranapingala, with a large army, was sent by King Unasena to conquer Meghapingala. He entered that country and was afflicted with fever due to drinking poisoned water. He was brought to Rupavati, and she cured him with that water. Unasena, out of anger, also went there and was similarly afflicted with fever. He was brought to Rupavati and, hearing the story of the water, he requested that water. Then, the minister said to Dhanashri, "O merchant! How can the bathwater of your daughter be poured on the head of the king?" The merchant said, "If the king asks about the nature of the water, then the truth will be told, there is no fault in that." Thus, Rupavati cured Ugrasen with that water. Then, the king, being healthy, asked Rupavati about the greatness of the water. She told him the truth. Then... 

Page #424:
---------------------------
In the Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra, the king, Vyāhuta, was afraid of the Śreṣṭhi and summoned him to his presence. The king, with great respect, requested the Śreṣṭhi to marry his daughter, Vṛṣabha-senā. The Śreṣṭhi replied, "O King, if you perform an eight-day puja to the Jina images, release the birds from their cages, and free all the humans who are imprisoned, then I will give you my daughter." Ugra-sena performed all these acts and married Vṛṣabha-senā, making her the queen. She, along with her husband, enjoyed a life of freedom and pleasure.

At this time, a king named Pṛthvī-candra, who ruled over Vārāṇasī, was imprisoned due to his great strength. His queen, Nārāyaṇa-dattā, consulted with her ministers and arranged for a grand welcome for Vṛṣabha-senā in Vārāṇasī, hoping to secure Pṛthvī-candra's release. When some Brahmanas and others who had been invited to a feast in Vārāṇasī went to Kāverī-pattana, they told the beautiful Rūpavatī about the welcome given to Vṛṣabha-senā. Rūpavatī, angered, asked Vṛṣabha-senā, "Why did you arrange for such a grand welcome in Vārāṇasī?" Vṛṣabha-senā replied, "I did not arrange for it, but someone did it in my name. You should investigate and purify them." Rūpavatī sent her messengers to investigate and, having learned the truth, told everything to Vṛṣabha-senā. Vṛṣabha-senā then appealed to the king, and Pṛthvī-candra was released.

Pṛthvī-candra then commissioned a painting depicting Vṛṣabha-senā and Ugra-sena. Below their images, he painted his own image, bowing to them. He showed this painting to Vṛṣabha-senā and said, "O Queen, you are my mother. By your grace, my life has become fruitful." Ugra-sena, honoring her, said, "You should go to Megha-pingala." He then sent them to Vārāṇasī. Megha-pingala, upon hearing this, thought, "This Pṛthvī-candra is a dangerous man," and went to Ugra-sena, where he was greatly honored and made a vassal. Ugra-sena decreed that half of the tribute received from the kingdom would go to Megha-pingala and the other half to Vṛṣabha-senā.

Once, two precious blankets arrived, each with a name attached. They were given to them. One day, Megha-pingala...

## Chapter Four:

85

The story of the victory of the queen, Vrishabhasena, is like a dark cloud that brings rain. It happened that Vrishabhasena's cloak was used to cover the rain, and Meghapingala, who was serving in the court of King Ugrasena, came to the court. The king, seeing the cloak, was extremely angry and his eyes became red. Meghapingala, seeing the king's anger, knew that the king was angry with him and fled. Vrishabhasena, being angry with Ugrasena, was thrown into the sea to be killed. She made a vow that if she was saved from this calamity, she would perform austerities. Then, due to the power of her vow, the water deities saved her from the sea and restored her throne. Hearing this, the king, filled with remorse, went to bring her back. On his way, he saw a sage named Gunadhara in the forest. Vrishabhasena bowed to him and asked about her past life. The sage told her that in her previous life, she was a Brahmin girl named Nagashri. She worked as a cleaner in the royal palace. One afternoon, a sage named Munidatta was lying in a pit in the palace courtyard, performing austerities. Vrishabhasena, seeing him, angrily said, "The king from the fort will come here soon, get up, get up, I am cleaning the floor, it's time for the wedding." But the sage continued his austerities in silence. Vrishabhasena then filled the pit with dirt and cleaned the floor. In the morning, the king came to the palace and while playing, he saw the dirt and the pit. He dug it up and removed the sage. Vrishabhasena, filled with remorse, developed an interest in Dharma. She took great care of the sage and gave him special medicines and food to alleviate his suffering. Then, she died and was reborn as Vrishabhasena, the daughter of a wealthy merchant. Due to the merit of giving medicine, she was born with a healthy body. Due to filling the pit with dirt, she was born with a blemish. Hearing this, Vrishabhasena freed herself and became an Aryika near the sage. This was the result of giving medicine.

The story of Kaundesha is an example of giving knowledge. This story... In the village of Kurumari, there was a cowherd named Govinda. He took out an ancient book from a cave and, with devotion, offered it to the sage Padmaninda. With that book, in the forest...

1. Kurumari - G, Kumari - Kh. 

Page #426:
---------------------------
## The Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra

Some former Bhattarakas, after performing worship and having a commentary written, placed it in a tree hollow and departed. Govinda, from childhood, had always seen it and performed worship to it, even to the tree hollow. This Govinda, after dying, was reborn as the son of a village headman in the same place. Seeing the Padmanandi Muni, he remembered his past life. Taking up austerities, he became a great Muni named Koṇḍeśa, a knower of the scriptures. This is the fruit of giving scriptures.

The example of a pig is given for giving shelter. In the country of Kathāmalava, in the village of Ghaṭa, there was a potter named Devila and a barber named Dhemilla. They built a temple for the purpose of providing shelter to travelers. Once, Devila first gave shelter to a Muni there, and later Dhemilla took in a wandering ascetic. The Muni, driven out by Dhemilla and the wandering ascetic, stayed at the foot of a tree at night, enduring bites from mosquitoes and cold. In the morning, Devila and Dhemilla fought with each other because of this and died, being reborn as a boar and a tiger in the Vindhya mountains. The boar lived in a cave, and one day, the Samādhi-gupta-trigupta Muni came and stayed in the same cave. Seeing them, they remembered their past lives. The boar, who was Devila in his past life, heard the Dharma and took up vows. At that time, smelling the scent of a human, the tiger came there to eat the Muni. The boar stood at the entrance of the cave to protect them. They fought with each other and died. The boar, having died with the intention of protecting the Muni and with good intentions, was reborn as a great god in the Saudharma heaven. The tiger, having died with the intention of eating the Muni and with fierce intentions, went to hell. This is the fruit of giving shelter. || 28 ||

Just as four types of gifts should be given to those who are in need, so also the method of worship should be performed.

## Chapter Four: Serving the Feet of the Supreme Lord Eliminates All Suffering

**Verse 29:** One should constantly serve the feet of the **Devaadhidev**, the one who is more worthy of worship than all the Devas (Indra and others). This service is the **Kamaduhi** (fulfiller of desires) and **Kamadahini** (destroyer of desires).

**Explanation:**  Serving the feet of the **Devaadhidev** is a **Kamaduhi** (fulfiller of desires) and **Kamadahini** (destroyer of desires). It is a **paricharan** (service) and **puja** (worship) that eliminates all suffering.

**Verse 30:** The great **Mahatmas** (noble souls) have spoken about the great power of serving the feet of the **Arhat**.

**Explanation:** A frog, filled with joy, spoke in the city of Rajagriha, saying, "The **Arhat**'s feet are worthy of service. This service has great power." He spoke this to the **Mahatmas** (noble souls) while holding a single flower.

**Story:** In the city of Rajagriha in the Magadha country, there was a king named Shrenik and a wealthy merchant named Nagadatta. Nagadatta, due to his deceitful nature, was reborn as a frog in the courtyard well of his own house. One day, he saw his wife, the wealthy merchant Bhavadatta, and remembering his past life, he went to her and croaked. She repeatedly chased him away, but he kept returning and croaking. She then thought, "Perhaps this is someone dear to me."

She consulted the wise **Suvrata Muni**, who, after hearing the story, took the frog home and treated him with great respect. King Shrenik, upon hearing that the **Vardhamana Swami** had arrived at Mount Vaibhara, ordered the beating of drums of joy and went with great pomp to pay his respects. As the king's wife and the household went to offer their respects, the frog picked up a lotus flower from the courtyard well and offered it as a **puja**.

---------------------------
## Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra

A man, while going to Hastināpura, accidentally crushed a rat with his foot and died. Due to the merit he had accumulated through his devotion to worship, he was born as Mahārdikadeva in the Saudharma heaven.  He remembered his past life through his knowledge of the past and, marking his crown with the sign of a frog, came to pay homage to Vardhamāna Svāmi. He was seen by Śroṇika. Then, Gautama Svāmi asked him about the reason for the frog mark on his crown. He then narrated his past life story. Hearing this, all the people were inspired to perform acts of worship with even greater devotion. || 30 ||

Now, the five transgressions of the Vaiyāvṛtya, which is the act of offering food to a monk, are: disrespect, forgetfulness, and envy. || 31 ||

These five transgressions of the Vaiyāvṛtya are mentioned in the first half of the Ārya.  They are as follows:

* **Haritapidhananidhāna:**  Offering food covered with a green lotus leaf or similar.
* **Anādarah:**  Lack of respect for the one who offers the food.
* **Asmaran:**  Forgetting to offer food to the monk at the appropriate time, or forgetting whether one has offered food or not.
* **Matsaratvam:**  Envy towards the giver and their generosity. || 31 ||

This is the fourth chapter of the Upāsakādhyayanaṭīkā, composed by Prabhācandra, a commentary on the work of Samantabhadra Svāmi.

---------------------------
## Sallekhana - The Fifth Pratikrama

**-dot-88-30**  It is said that Sallekhana should be performed like the Sagari and Anuvrata vows.

**1.**  The noble ones call Sallekhana the liberation of the body, performed in the face of incurable disease, famine, old age, or when one is unable to defend oneself against harm from animals, humans, or gods. This qualification applies to each of famine, old age, and disease. Why is this liberation performed? It is for the sake of Dharma, for the worship of the three jewels, not for the sake of killing another being or any other such act.

**1.**  In Sallekhana, one should strive with utmost effort according to the noble rules. Therefore, it is said:

**2.**  The scriptures praise the fruit of the penance, which is the renunciation of action at the end of life. Therefore, one should strive with all one's might to attain death in meditation.

**2.**  The scriptures praise the fruit of the penance, which is the renunciation of action at the end of life. Therefore, one should strive with all one's might to attain death in meditation.

**3.**  One who strives in this way should abandon love, hatred, attachment, and possessions, and with a pure mind, should forgive one's family and friends with kind words.

**1.**  What is the nature of this vow and when should it be performed?  

Page #430:
---------------------------
All the faults committed, caused, and approved of should be examined and renounced without any attachment. One should adopt the great vows, which are permanent until death and complete. (4)

One should forgive oneself, one's loved ones, and one's family with kind words. What should one do? One should abandon and renounce. Whom? Attachment to love and kindness, attachment to hatred and unkindness. Attachment to family, children, wife, etc., the feeling of "mine" and "this is mine," external and internal possessions. One should renounce all of this and become pure of mind and clear of heart, and then forgive. In the same way, one should adopt and establish within oneself. What is that? The great vows. What kind? Permanent until death, complete in all five aspects. What should one do? Examine. What is that? The faults. What are those? All that is committed, caused, and approved of. For example, one has committed the fault of violence, etc., caused it by being the reason, and approved of it by mentally praising it when done by another. One should examine all of this without any attachment, free from the ten faults of examination, as it should be. There are ten faults of examination. It is said:

"Akappayi, aṇumaṇiy, jandihen, bāndaram ca, suhemam ca,
Channāṁ saddāṁ ulayam, bahujanaṁ ancatta, tassevi." (1)

Thus, after examining in this way, one should adopt the great vows and do this, as it is said:

"One should abandon sorrow, fear, dejection, attachment, defilement, and aversion.
One should awaken one's strength and enthusiasm, and make the mind happy with the nectar of the scriptures." (5)

One should make the mind happy. With what? With the words of the scriptures. What kind? Like nectar, like the nectar that quenches the thirst of the suffering and pain of the world. What should one do? Abandon. What is that? Sorrow, etc. Sorrow is the grief over the loss of a loved one, their qualities, etc. Fear is the fear of the hells, etc., caused by hunger, thirst, etc., or pain. Dejection is sadness, grief, or distress. Attachment is affection. Defilement is attachment to something, passion and aversion. Not only the aforementioned, but also aversion, lack of interest. One should not only do this, but also awaken and manifest. What? Strength and enthusiasm, the strength to perform the vows. (5) 

Page #431:
---------------------------
## Chapter Five:

Now, describing the process of giving up food for one who is performing Sallekhana, it is said:

**6.** Gradually increase the intake of liquid food, starting with oily substances. Then, gradually replace the oily food with dry food.

**Explanation:**

* **Oily food:** This refers to milk and other similar liquids, which should be increased and consumed fully.
* **Giving up:** This means abandoning the solid food, which is in the form of small bites.
* **Gradually:** This refers to the process of gradually reducing the intake of solid food, starting with the first meal of the day and then progressively decreasing it.
* **Dry food:** This refers to gruel, water, or pure water, which should be consumed after giving up the oily food.
* **Gradually:** This means gradually replacing the oily food with dry food.
* **Oily food:** This refers to even oily drinks.
* **Gradually:** This means gradually reducing the intake of oily drinks.
* **Dry food:** This refers to gruel, water, or pure water, which should be consumed after giving up the oily food.
* **Gradually:** This means gradually replacing the oily food with dry food.

**7.** After giving up dry food, one should also give up food altogether, as per one's capacity. With all effort, one should abandon the five-fold attachment to the body.

**Explanation:**

* **Giving up dry food:** This means giving up dry food, as per one's capacity, gradually reducing the intake.
* **Giving up food:** This means fasting, which should be done as per one's capacity.
* **With all effort:** This means with all effort in all aspects of the vow, restraint, conduct, meditation, and concentration.
* **Five-fold attachment to the body:** This refers to the attachment to the body, which is characterized by the five senses.

**8.** Now, the transgressions of Sallekhana are described:

The five transgressions of Sallekhana, as instructed by the Jinas, are: fear of life and death, remembrance of friends, and the desire for future enjoyment.

**Explanation:**

* **Fear of life and death:** This refers to the fear of life and death, both in this world and the next.
* **Remembrance of friends:** This refers to the remembrance of friends from childhood and other stages of life.
* **Desire for future enjoyment:** This refers to the desire for future enjoyment, such as wealth, pleasure, and other worldly possessions.

These five transgressions are named after their respective characteristics. They are instructed by the Jinas, the Tirthankaras, and are described in the scriptures.

What fruit does one attain by performing Sallekhana, free from such transgressions? It is said:

> He drinks the ocean of happiness, free from all sorrows, having drunk the pure Dharma. ||9||

Does the one who performs Sallekhana drink, taste, or experience something? What is it? It is liberation, Nirvana. What is its special characteristic? It is the ocean of happiness, the sea of bliss. Then, it is said that he will be in that state forever:

## Chapter Five

**Pralahada** (joy), **ananta-saukhya** (infinite bliss), **trpti** (satisfaction), **vishaya-anakaanksha** (absence of desire for objects), **shuddhi** (purity), **davy-bhav-swaroop-karma-mal-rahitata** (absence of karmic impurities in the form of material desires), these are the qualities that connect one to the Self. Those who possess these qualities are called **tathokta** (thus spoken of). They are also **nir-atishya** (without excess), meaning they are free from excessive qualities like knowledge and other virtues. They are also **niravadhya** (without limitations), meaning they are free from any time-bound limitations. Those who possess these qualities reside in **nihsreyasa** (liberation). **Sukha** (happiness) is the form of **nihsreyasa**. Or, they reside in **nihsreyasa** in the same way that they experience **sukha**. || 11 ||

Since **siddhas** (liberated souls) may experience a change in their knowledge and other qualities over an infinite period of time, one may wonder how they can be considered **nir-atishya** and **niravadhya**. To address this doubt, the text says:

Even after a hundred **kalpas** (aeons) have passed, no change is observed in the **shivas** (liberated souls). Even if there were a **utpat** (cosmic disturbance) capable of causing confusion in the three worlds, || 12 ||

No change is observed, and it cannot be measured. What is this **vikriya** (change)? It is a **vikar** (transformation) or a change in the inherent nature. Who are these **shivas**? They are the **siddhas**. When does this happen? Even after a hundred **kalpas** have passed. One might think that due to a **utpat**, they might experience change. To this, the text says: Even if there were a **utpat**, no change is observed in them. What kind of **utpat** is this? It is a **trilok-sambhranti-karan-patu** (capable of causing confusion in the three worlds), meaning it is capable of causing confusion and upheaval in the three worlds. || 12 ||

Since they remain unchanged in their nature, what do they do? The text says:

Having attained **nihsreyasa**, they adorn the **trailokya-shikhamani-shri** (the jewel of the crown of the three worlds). They are radiant with a **nishkitta-kalika-chhavi** (form that is free from time-bound limitations) like the **chami-kar** (golden ornament). || 13 ||

Having attained **nihsreyasa**, they adorn the **trailokya-shikhamani-shri**, the jewel of the crown of the three worlds. What makes them special? The text says: They are **nishkitta** etc., meaning they are free from **kitta** (time) and **kalika** (limitations). Their form is free from these limitations, and they are radiant like **chami-kar** (golden ornament) due to their pure and luminous nature. || 13 ||

Thus, having explained the characteristics of **nihsreyasa** and its fruits, the text now explains the characteristics of **abhyudaya** (spiritual progress) and its fruits.

**Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra**

The righteous Dharma bears fruit in the form of an extraordinary and wondrous elevation, which is characterized by the attainment of Indra and other celestial beings.

**Now, the question arises: How many stages are there for a Śrāvaka who practices the great vows?**

**The Tirthankaras have declared eleven stages for a Śrāvaka, in which his qualities are progressively developed, building upon his previous qualities.**

## Chapter Five

**95**

Here, the term "special" is used. It is explained by the phrase "disenchanted with worldly existence, body, and enjoyment." This indicates that the specialness arises from the slight portion of vows. This is further explained: "Those who are devoted to the path of truth, the vows of truth, the path, the way, the eight fundamental virtues, such as abstinence from alcohol, are the ones who are devoted to the path. Those who take refuge in the five great gurus, the five supreme beings, their feet, the means of protection from destruction, are the ones who take refuge." || 16 ||

Now, the author describes the perfection of vows, virtues, and qualities in a devotee: "He who observes the five minor vows, the seven virtues, and the complete vow of non-transgression, is considered a true devotee by the devotees." || 17 ||

"He who possesses the vows is considered a devotee." Of whom? Of the devotees like Ganadhara Deva and others. Who is he? He who observes the five minor vows without any transgression. What are they? It means he observes all five minor vows without any transgression. He not only observes these but also the seven virtues, which are characterized by three types of virtuous vows and four types of disciplinary vows. || 17 ||

Now, describing the qualities of a devotee who possesses the virtue of Samayika, the author says: "He who performs four cycles of three, four prostrations, is established, born as such, a Samayika, who sits twice, is pure in three yogas, and salutes three times." || 18 ||

"Samayika" means he practices according to the previously explained method, thus possessing the virtue of Samayika. What is his special quality? He performs four cycles of three. For each act of bodily renunciation, there are three cycles of "Namo Arihantanam Thosaame" at the beginning and end. Thus, for each act of bodily renunciation, there are four cycles. Similarly, he performs four prostrations, one for each beginning and end. He is established, possessing the virtue of bodily renunciation. He is born as such, free from external and internal attachments and anxieties. He sits twice, meaning he sits down at the beginning and end while performing the worship of the gods. He is pure in three yogas, meaning his mind, speech, and body are pure, free from any impure actions. He salutes, meaning he performs the salutation. How? Three times a day. || 18 ||

Now, describing the vow of fasting and the virtue of Proshdha in a devotee, the author says: 

Page #436:
---------------------------
## Ratnakaranḍaka Śrāvakācāra:

**Verse 19:**

The one who observes the fast of **proṣadhana** (a Jain fast) with the rules of **proṣadhana** is called a **proṣadhanaśana**.  

**Explanation:**

The **proṣadhanaśana** is one who observes the fast of **proṣadhana**.  The rules of **proṣadhana** are essential, and one who follows them is called a **proṣadhanaśana**.  These rules include observing the fast on the four days of the **parva** (festival) and on the fourteenth and eighth days of the two fortnights.  This is done every month, without hiding one's own strength.  The **proṣadhanaśana** is also characterized by being focused on the **pranadhipati** (the object of devotion) and engaged in auspicious meditation.

**Verse 20:**

The one who does not eat roots, fruits, vegetables, branches, sprouts, stalks, tubers, flowers, or seeds is called a **saccittavirata** (one who has restrained the mind) and is an embodiment of compassion.

**Explanation:**

The **śrāvaka** (Jain lay follower) who is a **saccittavirata** does not eat these things.  These are all uncooked foods.  The **saccittavirata** is characterized by being an embodiment of compassion, having a compassionate heart.

**Verse 21:**

The one who does not eat food, drink, eatables, or lickables at night is called a **rātribhuctivirata** (one who has restrained from eating at night) and has a compassionate heart for all beings.

**Explanation:**

The **śrāvaka** who is a **rātribhuctivirata** does not eat at night.  This includes food like rice, drinks like grape juice, eatables like sweets, and lickables like candy.  The **rātribhuctivirata** is characterized by having a compassionate heart for all beings.

## Chapter Five:

Now, describing the virtue of *Brahmacharya* (celibacy) in a Shravaka, the text says:

**"He who, seeing the body, full of impurities, originating from impurities, decaying, foul-smelling, and repulsive, renounces the body, is a Brahmachari." (22)**

**Explanation:**

* **"Ananga"** refers to the body.
* **"Mala"** signifies semen and blood, the root cause of impurities.
* **"Malayoni"** denotes the origin of impurities, their unclean and impure nature.
* **"Galmala"** refers to the decaying impurities, like urine, feces, and sweat.
* **"Putigandi"** means foul-smelling.
* **"Bibhats"** signifies the repulsive nature of the body, causing aversion in those who see it.

**Therefore, a Brahmachari is one who renounces the body, seeing its inherent impurities and repulsiveness.**

Now, describing the virtue of *Aaram Bhavinivritti* (renunciation of worldly pursuits) in a Shravaka, the text says:

**"He who renounces all worldly pursuits, especially those involving service, agriculture, and commerce, due to the cause of violence against life, is one who has renounced worldly pursuits." (23)**

**Explanation:**

* **"Vyuparamati"** means to renounce worldly pursuits.
* **"Aaram"** refers to the beginning or origin of these pursuits.
* **"Seva, Krishi, Vanijya"** represent service, agriculture, and commerce, respectively.
* **"Pranatipatha Heto"** signifies the cause of violence against life.

**Therefore, a Shravaka who renounces worldly pursuits, especially those involving service, agriculture, and commerce, due to the cause of violence against life, is one who has renounced worldly pursuits.**

This renunciation extends to activities like bathing, giving charity, and performing rituals, as these can indirectly lead to violence against life. The Shravaka avoids these activities because they can cause harm to living beings.

Now, describing the virtue of *Parigrah Nivritti* (renunciation of attachment) in a Shravaka, the text says:

**"He who renounces the sense of 'mine' in the ten external objects, and remains detached, content, and free from attachment, is one who has renounced attachment." (24)**

**Explanation:**

* **"Bahyeshu Dasu Vastushu"** refers to the ten external objects of sense perception.
* **"Mamattvam Utsrijya"** means to renounce the sense of 'mine' in these objects.
* **"Nirmamatvaratah"** signifies being detached and free from attachment.
* **"Khastha"** means content and satisfied.
* **"Parichitta Parigrah Adviratah"** denotes being free from attachment to possessions.

**Therefore, a Shravaka who renounces the sense of 'mine' in the ten external objects, and remains detached, content, and free from attachment, is one who has renounced attachment.** 

Page #438:
---------------------------
## The Ratnakaranḍaka on the Conduct of Śrāvakas

The Śrāvakas, with their minds free from attachment, are known to be free from the attachment of possessions. Why? Because they are healthy and free from delusion. They are content with what they have, having renounced the desire for possessions. They are also free from attachment. How? By renouncing and abandoning. What? The delusion of "mine". Where? In the ten external objects. This is the tenfold classification of external objects:

* **Field:** Land for cultivation, like a farm.
* **Building:** Houses and other structures.
* **Wealth:** Gold and other precious metals.
* **Grain:** Rice and other cereals.
* **Two-legged:** Servants and maids.
* **Four-legged:** Cows and other animals.
* **Bed:** Cots and other sleeping arrangements.
* **Seat:** Mats and other seating arrangements.
* **Vehicle:** Palanquins and other modes of transport.
* **Clothing:** Cotton, silk, and other fabrics.
* **Utensils:** Sandalwood, red ochre, brass, copper, and other materials.

Now, describing the characteristics of a Śrāvaka who has renounced permission and restraint, the text says:

> "He who does not have permission for the beginning of possessions, worldly actions, or anything else, is considered to be free from permission and restraint."

He is considered to be free from permission and restraint because he clearly does not have permission. What is permission? It is acceptance. Where? In the beginning, like in agriculture. The word "or" indicates that it applies to all cases. In possessions, like grain, servants, and maids. In worldly actions, like marriage. What is a "samdhi"? It is a mind free from attachment, a mind free from the delusion of "mine".

Now, showing the characteristics of a Śrāvaka who possesses the qualities of renunciation, the text says:

> "He who has renounced his home and gone to the forest of the monks, has taken vows from the mouth of the guru, eats by begging, practices austerities, and is a wearer of a single piece of cloth."

The Śrāvaka who possesses the qualities of renunciation is a wearer of a single piece of cloth, meaning he wears only a loincloth and is a follower of the Ārya Linga. 

Page #439:
---------------------------
## Chapter Five

Thus, one who eats alms is called a "bhaikṣyāśana". What does he do? He performs austerities, he practices tapas. What does he do? He accepts, he takes. What? The vows. Where? At the feet of the guru, near the guru. What does he do? He goes, he travels. Where? To the forest of the munis, to the solitary hermitage. From where? From the home. || 26 ||

Even if one who performs austerities is ignorant of the scriptures, and thinks that he will become a knower of the good, then he is wrong. He should be certain that the dharma is the friend of the soul, and the evil is the enemy of the soul. 

If one knows the time, then he will surely become a knower of the good. || 27 || If one knows the time, if one knows the scriptures, then he will surely, certainly, become a knower of the good, an excellent knower. What does he do? He is certain. How? He says, "Evil, etc." - Evil is the enemy, the foe of the soul, because it causes many harms. Dharma is the friend of the soul, because it causes many benefits. Thus, he is certain. || 27 ||

Now, showing the fruit of the one who practices the meaning of the scriptures, he says -

By whom, by himself, is the soul brought to the state of having a treasure chest of jewels, of knowledge, of vision, and of action? He attains the fulfillment of all desires, like a bride in her own wedding, in the three worlds. || 28 || By whom, by the noble one, by himself, the soul, the word here refers to the soul, is brought, is attained. Who? He says, "Free, etc." - The stain, the fault, of those who are free from stain, of knowledge, of vision, and of action, of knowledge, of vision, and of conduct, their treasure chest, that noble one, he attains, he reaches. What is that? The fulfillment of all desires, the fulfillment of dharma, artha, kama, and moksha, the fulfillment of all desires. By whom does he attain it? Like a bride in her own wedding, like a woman in her own choice. Where? In the three worlds, in the three realms. || 28 ||

He also says that the treasure chest of jewels, which is the perfect state of being, grows for me, and it should grow for everyone.

May the land of happiness make the lover happy, like a beloved woman, may the pure-minded one enjoy me, like a mother her son. 

Page #440:

## 100
**Ratnakarandaka Shravaka Achar**

This is a woman, adorned with virtues, who is the perfect wife, a beholder of the lotus-like feet of the Jinas, and a bringer of fortune. || 29 || May she bring me happiness and make me happy. Who is she? She is Dristi Lakshmi, the wealth of right vision. What is her special quality? It is said, "Jina" and so on. The feet of the Jinas, the destroyers of karma, the lords of the Ganadharas, the Tirthankaras, are worthy of worship. She beholds those feet with faith. This is her virtue. This is the meaning: Lakshmi is one who beholds the lotus, while Dristi Lakshmi is one who beholds the meaning of the words of the Jinas. What is her nature? She is a land of happiness, a place where happiness arises. How? Just as a woman is a land of love for a lover, and brings him happiness, so too may Dristi Lakshmi bring me happiness. May she nourish and protect me, like a mother to her child. What is her special quality? A mother of pure virtue protects her child, while a mother of impure virtue, a wicked woman, does not. Dristi Lakshmi, adorned with the eight virtues, the three jewels, the teachings, the vows, and the seven limbs, may she nourish me. May she purify me, free from all blemishes and stains. What is she like? She is a woman of a good family, adorned with virtues. This is the meaning: Just as a woman of a good family, adorned with virtues, purifies and brings glory, so too does Dristi Lakshmi, adorned with the eight virtues, purify me. || 29 ||

**4004**

By whom the darkness of ignorance is destroyed, all the thoughts of the worthy soul are revealed by the rays of right knowledge, the path of the ocean is made manifest, that is the glorious Ratnakarandaka, the sun that dries up the ocean of samsara, may that Samantabhadra Muni, the glorious moon, the Jina, live long. || 1 ||

Thus ends the fifth chapter of the Samantabhadra Swami's Upasaka Adhyayana Tika, composed by Prabha Chandra.
