In the Jain tradition, Maryadapurushotam Ram is considered one of the 63 Shalaka Purushas. One of his names was also Padma. This name is more prevalent in Jain Puranas and Charitakavyas. Jain poets have presented Ram's character in various languages like Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, etc., under names like Paumachariyam, Paumachariyu, Padma Purana, Padmacharit, etc. Acharya Ravishena's (7th century) present work, Padma Purana, is considered one of the most excellent character-based epics in Sanskrit. Even though it is a Purana, this work is so extraordinary in terms of poetic art, psychoanalysis, character portrayal, etc., that it cannot be compared to any other Purana Kavya. The poetic beauty in it is so profound that this poetic stream, emanating from the mental snow-capped mountains as the poet's inner voice, seems to be the Mandakini itself. From the perspective of subject matter, the poet has depicted the Vidhyadharaloka, Anjana-Pavananjay, Hanuman, Sukoshal, etc., along with the main plot, which has increased the interest of the work so much that one does not feel like stopping after starting to read it once. Edited by Purana-paragami Dr. (Pan.) Pannalal Jain Sahityacharya with a preface, appendix, etc., and translated into Hindi, this work has been published in three volumes by Bharatiya Gyanpeeth. This is another new edition of the work, keeping in mind the expectation and need of scholars, researchers, and self-study enthusiasts.

**Topic:** Narada arrives at Sita's palace. Sita was looking at her reflection in the mirror. Seeing Narada's reflection in the mirror, Sita was terrified. Hearing the commotion between Narada and the women of the inner palace, the gatekeepers tried to stop him. But Narada somehow escaped and flew to Mount Kailash through the sky. There, he planned to take revenge on Sita and created her portrait. He took it and left it in the garden of the king of Rathnupur, a city located on Mount Vijayadh. Bhamandal was captivated by the portrait. Narada introduced the portrait, which further increased Bhamandal's infatuation. With the consent of King Chandragati, a Vidyadhara named Chapalaveg, taking the form of a horse, abducted King Janak from Mithila and brought him to Rathnupur. King Janak was pleased to see the grandeur of the place. The Vidyadharas proposed to King Janak to give Sita to Bhamandal, but King Janak firmly replied that he had already decided to give her to Dasharatha's son, Rama. Hearing the Vidyadharas' criticism of the earth-dwellers, King Janak gave a sharp reply. Finally, it was decided that "If Rama can string the Vajravarta bow, he can take Sita, otherwise Bhamandal will take her."

## Padmapurana

**Chapter Thirty**

The father returned to Mithila. A Swayamvara was held in Mithila, and Rama strung the bow and received the garland of jewels. Lakshmana also strung another bow and received eighteen maidens. Bharat married Lok-Sundari, the daughter of Kanak, the brother of King Janak.

**Chapter Thirty**

King Dasharatha, after the coronation of the Lord, sent Gandhodak (perfumed water) to all the queens.  A  senior Kanchuki (attendant) took it to Queen Suprabha, so he arrived late.  Young maidservants took it to the other queens, so they arrived quickly.  Suprabha, feeling insulted, asked for poison to kill herself.  The Kanchuki arrived with the poison, but at that moment, King Dasharatha arrived.  While the king and the other queens tried to console her, the old Kanchuki arrived with the Gandhodak.

Suprabha, pleased, applied the Gandhodak to her head.  King Dasharatha asked the Kanchuki the reason for the delay, and he explained it was due to his old age.  Seeing his frail condition, the king felt detached.  At that time, a Muni named Sarvabhutahit arrived in the Mahendrodya garden of Ayodhya.

**Chapter Thirty**

The Vidhyadhar had hidden the truth from Bhamandal, so he was distraught seeing the delay in meeting Sita.  Finally, one day, he confessed to his father and rebuked his friend Vasantdhwaj.  There, the Vidhyadhar revealed everything.  Bhamandal was enraged and, with the intention of abducting Sita, marched towards Ayodhya with his army.  When he saw the beautiful city of Vidagd, he remembered his past life and fainted.  Upon regaining consciousness, he felt great disgust for his evil thoughts.  He told the Chandrayan Vidhyadhar, "In my previous life, I was the king of this place, Kundalmandit.  Due to the influence of Dharma, I was born as the son of King Janak.  I was abducted as soon as I was born.  I grew up here with you.  The Sita for whom I am going mad is my own sister."  Finally, Bhamandal, along with his seven followers, went to the Sarvabhutahit Muni in the Mahendrodya garden of Ayodhya.  The Chandrayan Vidhyadhar expressed his desire to take initiation.  Bhamandal's lamentations were heard by Sita, who woke up.  Everyone met at the Sarvabhutahit Muni.  Sita met her brother.  King Dasharatha informed King Janak.  King Janak, with his family, arrived and met his abducted son, experiencing immense joy.  King Janak handed over his kingdom to his brother Kanak and left with Bhamandal to conquer the world.

**Chapter Thirty-One**

Sarvabhutahit Muni described the previous lives of Dasharatha.

Hearing about his past lives, King Dasharatha's already detached heart became even more detached.  He declared his decision to the ministers and announced Rama's coronation.  When the time came, Kaikeyi, Bharat's mother, demanded her previously promised boon and asked for the kingdom for Bharat.  King Dasharatha was in a dilemma.  He revealed his predicament to Rama.

**73-78**  Ram, after leaving his father, goes to his mother Aparajita (Kaushalya) and, after consoling her, prepares to go to the forest. Sita and Lakshman accompany him. Ram, Lakshman, and Sita, along with many people from the kingdom, leave the city. As the sun sets, they stop at the Shri Jin Mandir outside the city. Dasharatha's other wives plead with him to bring Ram and Lakshman back, but Dasharatha, with his detached heart, does not consider it appropriate to get involved in this world anymore.

**76-85**  On the 32nd day, Ram, Lakshman, and Sita, while everyone else was asleep in the outer courtyard, leave the temple through the western gate and head south in the middle of the night. Upon waking, many people chase after them and accompany them for some distance. Finally, Ram and Lakshman cross a terrifying river called Pariyatra in the middle of the forest, but the ministers and other citizens could not cross it. As a result, many returned home, and some took diksha (initiation). After this, King Dasharatha took diksha from the Muni Raja, who was dedicated to the welfare of all beings. Kaushalya and Sumitra were very sad without their husband and son. Seeing their sorrowful state, Kekaya, Bharat's mother, tells Bharat to go and bring Ram and Lakshman back. She says she will follow him. Later, Bharat sees Ram and Lakshman on the bank of a lake in a dense forest. They all reunite. Kekaya and Bharat plead with Ram to return, but their efforts are in vain. Ram does not return. Bharat, disheartened, returns and takes up the responsibility of ruling the kingdom. He vows to the Dyuti Bhattarak that he will take Muni diksha upon seeing Ram. Dyuti Bhattarak gives everyone a true discourse on Dharma.

**86-100**  On the 33rd day, Ram and Lakshman, after crossing the Chitrakoot forest, reach the land of Avanti. Seeing a desolate land, they ask a poor man who has come there about the reason. He tells them the story of King Vajrakarn of Dasangapur. He then describes the arrogance of Singhodar. He narrates the conflict between Singhodar and Vajrakarn and explains that Singhodar, in anger, has made this fertile land desolate.

**101-113**  Ram and Lakshman move forward, seeking food. King Vajrakarn, attracted by Lakshman's beauty, offers him the finest food. Lakshman brings all of it to Ram. Ram is deeply touched by Vajrakarn's hospitality and sends Lakshman to protect him. Lakshman, becoming Bharat's servant, sets Singhodar straight and defeats him, protecting Vajrakarn. Finally, Ram and Lakshman, after bringing about friendship between Vajrakarn and Singhodar, move forward.

**Chapter Thirty-Four**

Rama is residing in the forest, and Lakshmana goes to the edge of a lake to fetch water. There, a prince, mounted on an elephant, calls out to Lakshmana through his servants and expresses his affection for him. When Lakshmana says that he must first send food to his brother, the prince summons the finest food and, through the chief gatekeeper, invites Rama and Sita to his pavilion. Lakshmana was already there, and Sita and Rama also arrived. After hosting them all, the prince revealed his true form. Despite being a woman, she had been living in the guise of a man. When asked, she told her story: "My father, Balikhilya, has been imprisoned by a Mlechchha king since before my birth. In his absence, I have been ruling the kingdom in the guise of a man. My name is Kalyanamala." Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita comforted her. Later, they subdued the Mlechchha king and freed Balikhilya from his bonds.

**Chapter Thirty-Five**

While wandering through the forest, Sita becomes tired. Her mouth dries up from thirst. Rama and Lakshmana comfort her and take her to a nearby village, where they stay in the renowned ashram of Kapil Brahmana. Sita drinks cool water offered by the Brahmana's wife, and her heart is calmed. However, at that moment, Kapil Brahmana arrives, carrying a load of firewood on his head. Seeing them staying in his ashram, he becomes enraged at his wife and insults them, forcing them to leave. Lakshmana, agitated, is calmed by Rama, and they go to rest under a banyan tree in the forest. Dark clouds gather in the sky, and a heavy downpour begins. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita are drenched in the rain, helpless. The Yakshapati, recognizing them as Balabhadra and Narayana through his divine knowledge, creates a city and shelters them there. Suddenly, Kapil Brahmana arrives near the city, embraces Jainism, and, captivated by Rama's generosity, goes to their court with his wife. Seeing Lakshmana, he tries to flee in fear, but after being comforted, he sits down and praises Rama. Rama bestows upon him immense wealth and prosperity. Feeling remorse for his past actions, the Brahmana bows his head in shame. Finally, he entrusts the burden of household life to his wife and takes Jain initiation.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**

When the rainy season ends, Rama leaves the Yaksha-built Rampuri. The Yaksha king asks for forgiveness. Crossing the Mahavana, Rama reaches the plains near Vaijayantapur. They spend the night under a tree. The king of Vaijayantapur, Prithividhara, and his queen, Indrani, had a daughter named Vanamala, who had been in love with Lakshmana from the beginning. However, upon hearing of their forest journey, King Prithividhara decided to marry her off to another prince. Seeing this, Vanamala, filled with suicidal thoughts, went to the forest with her companions under the pretext of worshipping the forest goddess. After everyone else fell asleep, she prepared to hang herself from the branches of a northern tree. Lakshmana, hiding nearby, saved her life.

**Chapter 37**

Rama is seated in the assembly hall of King Prithividhar. At that time, a messenger from King Ativirya arrives with a letter for King Prithividhar. The letter states that Ativirya is going on a campaign against King Bharata and requests immediate assistance. Upon Rama's inquiry, the messenger explains the reason for the campaign against Bharata. After receiving Rama's signal, King Prithividhar assures the messenger and sends him off. After mutual discussion, Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and the sons of Prithividhar set out towards Ativirya's capital. Upon reaching there, they decided upon a course of action. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, disguised as dancers, entered Ativirya's court. They captivated him with their unparalleled music and skillful dance. Seeing the spectacle, a dancer reprimanded Ativirya, stating that his campaign against Bharata would lead to his death. She advised him to pay homage to Bharata if he wished to live. Hearing this reprimand and praise for Bharata, Ativirya, filled with pride, raised his sword to kill the dancers. Lakshmana swiftly snatched the sword and used it to subdue Ativirya, striking fear into the hearts of all the kings present. Witnessing this extraordinary power of the dancers, the assembled kings fled. Rama and Lakshmana brought the bound Ativirya before Sita. Seeing his sorrowful state, Sita was moved with compassion and had him released. Ativirya renounced all worldly possessions and embraced Jain initiation. Rama and Lakshmana, like night clouds, moved forward, protecting Bharata in an unseen manner.

**Chapter 38**

Rama performed the coronation of Ativirya's son, Vijayaratha. Upon hearing of Ativirya's transformation into a monk, Bharata went to seek his blessings. He apologized for his actions and praised the monk. Bharata was unaware of the dancers' true identity and was immersed in a sea of wonder. Assuring Vanamala, Rama and Lakshmana moved forward. They stopped outside the city of Kshemanjalipur. After a meal, Lakshmana, following Rama's command, entered the city. He encountered the powerful King Shatrudaman and won over his daughter, Jinpadma. King Shatrudaman, along with his army, went to meet Rama and Sita. Seeing the approaching army, they were initially surprised, but upon learning the truth, they were relieved. Lakshmana married Jinpadma.

**Chapter 39**

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita journeyed to the city of Vansasthadyuti. They encountered fleeing citizens who informed them of a terrifying sound emanating from a mountain. Rama followed the sound. They met the monks Deshabhushan and Kulbhushan and helped them overcome the affliction caused by the fire-god Agniprabha. The monks attained perfect knowledge. The monks narrated the story of Udit and Mudit, sons of Amritaswar, messengers of King Vijayaparbhat and Queen Dharini of Padmininagari, along with their past lives. They also described the past lives of the monks Deshabhushan and Kulbhushan.

Hearing the name of Ravana, the Vidhyadharas were terrified. At Rama's strong insistence, the Vanaras were ready to help, saying that the Muni Indra had said that Ravana's death would be at the hands of one who could lift a mountain of a million stones.

## The Padma Purana, Chapter 26: The Story of Janaka

**The Acharya, Shrimadaravisha, narrates the Padma Purana, also known as the Padmacharita.**

**Hear now, O Shrenika, the story of Janaka's connection.** I will relate the tale, so pay close attention. ||1||

Janaka had a beautiful wife named Videha. A celestial being, for a long time, awaited the birth of her child. ||2||

Hearing this, Shrenika asked, "O Lord, why did that celestial being protect Videha's womb? I wish to know, please tell me." ||3||

Gautama Swami replied, "In the city of Chakrapura, there lived a king named Chakradhvaja. His wife was named Manavini." ||4||

From their union, a daughter named Chittotstava was born. She adorned the guru's house, the Chaatshaala, writing alphabets on pieces of clay. ||5||

In the same guru's house, the king's priest, Dhumkesha, had a son named Pingala, born to his wife Swaha. ||6||

Chittotstava and Pingala's hearts were captivated by each other, preventing them from attaining knowledge. This is fitting, for knowledge and Dharma are attained only by those with a steady mind. ||7||

The Acharya says, "First, there is a union, a meeting of man and woman. From this union arises affection, from affection arises desire, from desire arises trust, and from trust arises love. Thus, love arises from these five causes. Just as the five sins, like violence, bind one to karma, so too, love arises from these five causes, binding beings in a deep bond." ||8-9||

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that when Pingala, filled with the desire for Chittotsava, came to know her true nature, he abducted her. Just as infamy steals away fame, so too did Pingala steal away Chittotsava. ||10|| When he took her to a distant land, her relatives came to know of it. Just as delusion steals away the path to liberation, so too did carelessness lead to the abduction of the maiden. ||11|| Pingala, the abductor, was delighted with the maiden, but being poor, he did not shine in her presence, just as a greedy man devoid of Dharma does not shine due to his lust. ||12|| Pingala, carrying the maiden, reached a fortified city inaccessible to foreigners. He built a hut outside the city, where other poor people lived, and stayed there. ||13|| He was devoid of knowledge and wisdom, and immersed in the ocean of poverty. Therefore, he protected his wife by collecting straw and wood. ||14|| In the same city lived King Kundalamandit, the son of King Prakash Singh and Queen Pravaravali, who was feared by enemy nations. ||15|| One day, while he was out of the city, he saw Chittotsava. Upon seeing her, he was struck by the five arrows of love and became extremely distressed. ||16|| He secretly sent a messenger to Chittotsava, who brought her to the royal palace at night, just as earlier, King Sumukh's messenger had brought Kamalamela to his palace. ||17|| Just as Nalakubara, filled with love, enjoyed the company of Urvashi, so too did Kundalamandit, filled with affection, enjoy the company of Chittotsava. ||18||
Later, when Pingala, exhausted, returned home, he did not see his wide-eyed wife and was immersed in the ocean of sorrow. ||19|| Gautam Swami says, what more can be said? He was filled with the sorrow of separation and, like a man on a wheel, was restless and could not find happiness anywhere. ||20|| Then, the Brahmin, whose wife had been abducted, went to the king and said, "O King! Someone has stolen my wife." ||21|| The king is the refuge of all, especially women and men who are afraid, poor, and distressed. ||22||
When Pingala fully understood the nature of Chittotsava's desire, he took her away to a secluded place. Just as infamy steals away fame, so too did Pingala steal away Chittotsava. ||10|| When he took her to a distant land, her relatives came to know of it. Just as delusion steals away the path to liberation, so too did carelessness lead to the abduction of the maiden. ||11|| Pingala, the abductor, was delighted with the maiden, but being poor, he did not shine in her presence, just as a greedy man devoid of Dharma does not shine due to his lust. ||12|| Pingala, carrying the maiden, reached a fortified city inaccessible to foreigners. He built a hut outside the city, where other poor people lived, and stayed there. ||13|| He was devoid of knowledge and wisdom, and immersed in the ocean of poverty. Therefore, he protected his wife by collecting straw and wood. ||14|| In the same city lived King Kundalamandit, the son of King Prakash Singh and Queen Pravaravali, who was feared by enemy nations. ||15|| One day, while he was out of the city, he saw Chittotsava. Upon seeing her, he was struck by the five arrows of love and became extremely distressed. ||16|| He secretly sent a messenger to Chittotsava, who brought her to the royal palace at night, just as earlier, King Sumukh's messenger had brought Kamalamela to his palace. ||17|| Just as Nalakubara, filled with love, enjoyed the company of Urvashi, so too did Kundalamandit, filled with affection, enjoy the company of Chittotsava. ||18||
Later, when Pingala, exhausted, returned home, he did not see his wide-eyed wife and was immersed in the ocean of sorrow. ||19|| Gautam Swami says, what more can be said? He was filled with the sorrow of separation and, like a man on a wheel, was restless and could not find happiness anywhere. ||20|| Then, the Brahmin, whose wife had been abducted, went to the king and said, "O King! Someone has stolen my wife." ||21|| The king is the refuge of all, especially women and men who are afraid, poor, and distressed. ||22||

The twenty-sixth chapter. The king, summoning the cunning minister, said, "Do not delay, find his wife quickly." ||23|| One of the ministers, with his eyes full of deceit, said, "O King! The travelers saw her on the road to Paudanpur." ||24|| She was standing among the group of Aryikas, ready to perform austerities. O Brahmin! Go quickly and bring her back. Why are you crying here?" ||25|| When she is adorned with a youthful body, full of the qualities of excellent women, and capable of captivating young men, what is this time for her to perform austerities?" ||26|| Upon hearing this, the Brahmin got up, tightened his belt, and ran with great speed, like a horse freed from its bonds. ||27|| He searched for her in the temples and groves of Paudanpur. When he did not find her, he quickly returned to Vidaghapur. ||28|| By the king's order, cruel men seized him, choked him, threatened him, and beat him with sticks and stones, driving him far away. ||29|| He experienced displacement, great hardship, humiliation, and death. He traveled a long distance. ||30|| Without his beloved, he found no pleasure anywhere. He withered day and night, like a snake fallen into fire. ||31|| He saw the vast lotus forest like a raging fire, and even entering the lake, he burned with the fire of separation. ||32|| Thus, with a heart filled with sorrow, he wandered over the earth. He saw the Digambara Acharya, Aryagupta, standing at the gate of the city. Approaching him, he folded his hands, bowed his head, and joyfully listened to the true nature of Dharma. ||33-34|| Having heard Dharma from the Muni, he attained supreme detachment and, with a peaceful mind, praised the teachings of the Jinas. ||35|| "Oh! This path, shown by the Jinas, is of the highest virtue. I was lost in darkness, and this path has risen for me like the sun." ||36|| 

Page #22:
---------------------------

I take refuge in the teachings of the Jinas, which destroy all sins. I will now pacify this body, which is burnt by the fire of separation. || 37 || Having attained this feeling, and being approved by the Guru, he renounced all possessions and took the Digambara vows. || 38 || Although he wandered the earth, free from all attachments, he was sometimes troubled by thoughts of worldly pleasures. || 39 || He lived in rivers, mountains, forts, cremation grounds, and forests, performing the supreme austerities that dried up his body. || 40 || His mind did not become troubled during the dark rainy season, nor did his body tremble in the winter from the mud of snow. || 41 || He was not even slightly scorched by the rays of the sun. He always remembered the virtuous, for what is difficult for love? || 42 || Even though his body was burning with the fire of separation, he repeatedly quenched it with the showers of the Jina's words. || 43 || His body, due to the constant remembrance of his beloved and the intense austerities, became like a half-burnt tree, dark in color. || 44 || 

Now, I will tell you the story of Kundalamandita. Listen! Just as a string of jewels is made up of different jewels, so too is a story made up of different stories. || 45 || This story took place when King Anaranya was ruling his kingdom. Listen to this story, which is told in sequence. || 46 || Kundalamandita, relying on his fortified city, constantly harassed Anaranya's land, just as a wicked person violates the rules of his family. || 47 || Just as a wicked person destroys virtues, he destroyed many of Anaranya's lands. And just as a yogi controls his passions, he controlled many of Anaranya's vassals. || 48 || Although he was small, Anaranya was unable to capture him. What could the king of the deer do to the mouse who lived in the mountain cave? || 49 ||

---------------------------
## The Twenty-Sixth Chapter

He, consumed by thoughts of defeat, withered day and night. He even neglected his bodily needs, performing them with indifference. ||50||

Then, one day, his commander, Balachandra, addressed him, "My lord, why do you appear so constantly distressed?" ||51||

"My dear Balachandra, my greatest cause for worry is Kundalamandit," replied Anaranya. ||52||

"My king, I vow that I will not return to your presence until I have subdued that wicked Kundalamandit. This is my solemn vow," declared Balachandra. ||53||

Thus, vowing before the king, the commander, filled with anger, prepared to march with his four-fold army. ||54||

Kundalamandit, his mind consumed by frivolous pleasures, abandoned all other pursuits. His ministers and other core supporters had all deserted him. He was oblivious to the world around him, his efforts focused solely on a woman. Balachandra, like a hunter, easily captured him. ||55-56||

The clever Balachandra, seizing control of his army and kingdom, banished him from the land and returned to Anaranya. ||57||

Anaranya, his kingdom restored to peace and prosperity by his loyal servant, experienced immense joy and contentment. ||58||

Kundalamandit, stripped of his kingdom, was left with only his body. He wandered the earth on foot, perpetually sorrowful and filled with regret. ||59||

One day, while wandering, he reached the hermitage of the Digambar monks. He bowed his head in reverence to the Acharya Maharaj and earnestly inquired about the nature of Dharma. ||60||

"It is indeed true," replied the Acharya, "that those who are afflicted with sorrow, poverty, bereft of loved ones, and burdened by illness, often turn their minds towards Dharma." ||61||

Kundalamandit then asked, "O revered one, what is the Dharma for one who lacks the strength to take monastic vows and is consumed by worldly attachments?" ||62|| 

Page #24:
---------------------------
## Padma Purana:

**How can a householder who is devoted to the four vows be freed from sins? I wish to know this, please be pleased and explain it to me.** ||13||

**The Guru said: Compassion for living beings is considered Dharma. Those who are self-deprecating and insulting are freed from sins.** ||6||

**If you desire pure Dharma, do not consume flesh, which is a terrible cause of violence and arises from semen and blood.** ||65||

**The sinful man who fills his belly with the flesh of creatures who fear death, surely goes to hell.** ||66||

**Shaving the head, bathing, and wearing various ornaments, etc., do not protect the flesh-eater.** ||67||

**Bathing in holy places, giving charity, and fasting, etc., do not save the flesh-eater from hell.** ||68||

**All beings of all species are our relatives from past lives. Therefore, one should understand that the flesh-eater eats his own brothers and sisters.** ||69||

**The man who kills birds, fish, and animals, and acts against them, is more cruel than even the honey-eating animal, and attains a more terrible state.** ||70||

**Flesh is not born from trees, nor does it emerge from the earth, nor is it born from water like a lotus, nor is it produced from any other excellent substance like medicine. But wicked men produce flesh by killing birds, fish, animals, etc., who cherish their lives. Therefore, compassionate men never eat it.** ||71-72||

**How painful it is that wicked men eat the cow, whose milk nourishes their bodies, and who is like a mother!** ||73||

**The wicked man who eats flesh has eaten his mother, father, son, friends, and brothers.** ||74||

**From here, there are seven earths below Mount Meru. Among them, in the earth called Ratnaprabha, dwell the Bhavanavasi Devas. Those who perform austerities with kshaya (attachment) are born there. These Bhavanavasi Devas are the lowest among the Devas, being filled with evil deeds.** ||75-76||

**Is there no Dharma for a householder?** ||62||

**Or, how can a householder who is devoted to the four vows be freed from sins? I wish to know this, please be pleased and explain it to me.** ||63||

**Then the Muni Raja said the following: Compassion for living beings is Dharma, and by self-deprecating and insulting oneself, one is freed from sins.** ||64|| 

Page #25:
---------------------------
The twenty-sixth chapter speaks of the six terrible earths below this earth, where the hellish beings experience the fruits of their sinful karma. ||7|| These hellish beings are ugly, their voices are dreadful, they are filled with darkness, and their bodies are the cause of unbearable suffering. ||78|| Among these earths is the terrible hell called Kumbhipaka, the terrifying river Vaitarani, and the Salmali tree with sharp thorns. ||79|| There are forests covered with sword-leaves, mountains like razor blades, and sharp iron spikes like burning fire, constantly present. ||80|| Those who eat honey and meat, and those who kill living beings, experience intense suffering in these hells constantly. ||81|| There is not even a space the size of a fingernail where the suffering hellish beings can find even a moment's rest. ||82|| Thinking, "We will hide here," the hellish beings flee, but they are killed by other merciless hellish beings and evil gods. ||83|| Just as fish burning in a fire of twisted embers make a dull sound, so too do the hellish beings make a dull sound when they fall into the fire. If, out of fear of the fire, they somehow escape and reach the water of the Vaitarani river, they are burned even more by the extremely salty waves. ||84-85|| If, desiring shade, they quickly flee to the forest of sword-leaves, they are cut to pieces by falling wheels, swords, clubs, and other weapons. ||86|| Those whose noses, ears, shoulders, and thighs, etc., have been cut off, and who vomit blood as if raining, are put into Kumbhipaka, meaning they are cooked in a pot or other container. ||87|| Those who make cruel sounds are thrown into cruel mills, and then they are dropped onto sharp mountains, breaking them into pieces, causing them to make a dull sound. ||88|| They are placed on very tall, dark trees, and their heads are beaten with large maces. ||89|| When those who are thirsty for water ask for it, they are given copper-colored dust, which burns their bodies and causes them great suffering. ||90|| 

Page #26:
---------------------------
The scriptures say that even if they say they are not thirsty, they are forcibly fed the molten metal by the tormentors, their mouths being torn open. ||9|| The wicked tormentors throw them down on the ground, climb on their chests, and crush them with their feet, uttering cruel words. ||12|| The throats of those tormented ones are burnt, their hearts burn, and their intestines come out, their bellies being ripped open. ||13|| Who can describe the suffering they experience from the tormentors of the hell, who make them fight each other? ||94|| Knowing this great suffering in hell, the wise should abstain from eating meat. ||95|| 
In the meantime, Kundal, whose mind was filled with fear, said, "O Lord, what is the fate of those who observe the Anuvrata?" ||96|| The Guru said, "I will tell you the merit of those who do not eat meat and observe the vow with great firmness, especially those who have attained Samyagdrsti." ||97|| Even if a wise person is poor and does not observe fasts, etc., but refrains from eating meat, he will attain a good destiny. ||98|| And a person who is virtuous, devoted to the teachings of the Jinas, and observes the Anuvrata, is born in the heavens like Saudharma, etc. ||99|| Non-violence is said to be the best root of Dharma. It is only for those who abstain from eating meat that this pure non-violence flourishes. ||100|| Even if a person is greedy, a barbarian, or a Chandala, if he is compassionate and refrains from eating honey and meat, he is freed from sin. ||101|| Such a being, freed from sin, starts accumulating merit, and due to the influence of that merit, he becomes a god or a good human being. ||102|| If a person with Samyagdrsti observes the Anuvrata, he will surely attain the supreme pleasures of the gods. ||103|| 

Page #27:
---------------------------
## The Twentieth Chapter

Hearing the words of the Acharya, Kundalamandita, being of weak fortune, was unable to even perform the Anuvrata. || 104 || 

Prostrating to his Guru with his head, he renounced meat and honey, and embraced the proper vision of the Sharanagata. || 105 || 

After paying homage to the Guru and the Digambaras, he left that country, filled with thoughts. || 106 || 

His maternal brother, a man of great prowess like Yama, will surely be my support in this calamity. I will become a king again and surely conquer my enemy. || 107 || 

Carrying this hope, he set out, sorrowful, towards the south. || 108 || 

As he journeyed, burdened with fatigue and other sorrows, diseases arose in his body, due to the ripening of past karmas. || 109 || 

His joints began to break, and his vital organs were torn apart. Death, the refuge of all the world, approached him. || 110 || 

At the moment Kundalamandita released his life, the Chittottsava, who had become a deva in heaven, fell from heaven due to the depletion of his remaining merit. || 111 || 

By fate, both these beings were born in the womb of Videha, the queen of King Janaka. Oh, Shrenika! See the strange workings of karma! || 112 || 

In the meantime, that Pingala Brahmin, having died well, became a powerful Asura named Mahakala, due to the power of his austerities. || 113 || 

As soon as he was born, he remembered his past life through his knowledge of the future, and considered the fruits of Dharma. He also wondered where Chittottsava had been born, and he knew all this through his knowledge of the future. || 114 || 

Then, after a while, he thought, "What do I have to do with that wicked one? Where is that Kundalamandita who caused me to fall into the ocean of separation and made me suffer?" || 115 || 

He knew through his knowledge of the future that Kundalamandita was in the womb of King Janaka's wife, along with the being of Chittottsava. || 116 || 

He thought, "What is the purpose of this Devi, who is carrying two beings in her womb, and is now dead?" || 117 || 

Page #28:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that the sin, adorned with a Kundala, is firmly established. I will bring upon him the suffering that is most appropriate for him. ||11|| Thinking thus, the Asura, due to the influence of his past karma, became very wealthy and, rubbing his hands together, protected the fetus. ||119|| Knowing this, Gautama Swami says, "O King! It is not right to cause suffering to anyone, for in due time, that suffering will return to oneself." ||120|| ... Then, in due time, Queen Videha gave birth to a son and a daughter, a pair of children. As soon as they were born, the Asura abducted the son. ||121|| He first thought, "I will crush this Kundala-adorned creature on a stone and kill him." Then, after a while, he began to think. ||122|| "Fie on the thoughts I have had! How can a wise man do an act that increases the cycle of birth and death?" ||123|| In a previous life, when I was a Shraman, free from all beginnings and carrying the burden of tapas, I did not even harm a blade of grass. ||124|| By the grace of my Guru, I have attained such purity of Dharma. How can I now commit such a sin? ||125|| Even a small amount of accumulated sin grows immensely, causing the being immersed in the ocean of Samsara to burn with suffering for a long time. ||126|| But for one whose mind is free from guilt, who is compassionate, and who keeps his actions in check, the jewel of liberation is held in his hand. ||127|| Thinking thus, compassion arose in his heart, and he abandoned the thought of killing the child. He adorned him with Kundalas, holders of radiant rays, in his ears. ||128|| Then, the Deva imparted the Parnaldhvi Vidya to the child, left him in a safe place, and went to his desired destination. ||129||

---------------------------
The twenty-sixth chapter.

At night, Chandragati, the Vidyadhara, was in his garden when he saw the child falling from the sky, a vessel of happiness.  [130]

"Is this a falling star, or a piece of lightning?" he wondered. As he flew up into the sky, he saw the auspicious child. [131]

With great joy, he took the child and placed him between the thighs of the sleeping Queen Pushpavati, who lay on a luxurious bed. [132]

"Wake up, wake up, beautiful one!" he called out in a loud voice. "Look, you have given birth to a beautiful child!" [133]

Awakened by the touch of her husband and the joy of the moment, the Queen quickly rose from her bed, her eyes darting about. [134]

As soon as she saw the beautiful child, his radiant light dispelled the last vestiges of her sleep. [135]

Overwhelmed with wonder, the beautiful Queen asked, "Who is the mother of this child, who has been born to a woman of such great merit?" [136]

"My dear," Chandragati replied, "this is your own son. Have faith, do not doubt. Who could be more blessed than you?" [137]

"My love," she said, "I am barren. How could I have a son? I have been tricked by fate, deceived. Why are you deceiving me further?" [138]

"My dear," he said, "do not be afraid. Perhaps, through the workings of karma, a woman can conceive even without knowing it." [139]

"Very well," she said, "but tell me, why are his ear ornaments so extraordinary? Where in this human world could such precious jewels be found?" [140]

"My dear," Chandragati replied, "what is the point of such speculation? Listen to the truth. I found this child falling from the sky." [141]

"This is your son, born into a noble family, and I approve of him. His signs indicate that he is destined for greatness." [142]

"Even though you have endured great hardship and carried the burden of pregnancy, the fruit of your labor is now here. You have been blessed, my love." [143] 

Page #30:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that a son who does not perform the duties of a son, even though born from the womb, is considered as good as childless or an enemy.  (144)  Oh, virtuous wife! You have no son, therefore, this child will be your son. What is the purpose of going inside this beautiful object? (145)  Saying this, the queen went to the delivery room.  At dawn, the news of her son's birth was spread throughout the kingdom with great joy. (146)  Then, a birth celebration was held in the city of Rathnupura.  All the relatives and friends gathered, filled with wonder. (147)  Since the child was surrounded by a circle of radiant, jeweled earrings, his parents named him Bhamandala. (148)  This child, who charmed everyone with his playful antics and moved like a bee among the lotus hands of the entire inner palace, was entrusted to the care of a wet nurse for his upbringing. (149)  Meanwhile, Queen Videha, lamenting like a cuckoo bird, grieved over the loss of her son, plunging all her relatives into an ocean of sorrow. (150)  She wailed like one struck by a wheel, "Alas, my child! What cruel person has taken you away?" (151)  How could the hands of that wicked sinner have dared to touch you, an innocent child who had just been born? It seems his heart is made of stone. (152)  Just as the sun sets in the west, leaving behind twilight, so too my unfortunate son has set, leaving me with this daughter, like twilight. (153)  Surely, in a past life, I must have caused the separation of a child from his mother, and now this karma is bearing its fruit.  For no action can occur without a seed. (154)  Why didn't that wicked thief of a son simply kill me? Instead, he has inflicted upon me this unbearable pain, leaving me half-dead. (155)  Seeing the queen wailing loudly in this way, King Janaka approached her and comforted her, saying, "My dear, do not grieve excessively. Your son is alive.  He has been taken away by someone, but you will surely see him alive." (157)

## The Twentieth Canto

It is gone, and surely you will see it again, alive.  What is the use of crying in vain, dear, for what is seen, then unseen, and then seen again, due to the influence of past karma? || 158 ||

I am sending this letter to your well-wisher, King Dasharatha, for your health. || 159 ||

He and I will both search for your son, covering the entire earth with clever spies. || 160 ||

Thus comforting his beloved, he gave the letter to his friend.  Filled with excessive grief, he read the letter. || 161 ||

They searched for the child, but they did not find him.  Then, with their grief subdued, the relatives sat in great distress. || 162 ||

There was no man or woman whose eyes were not filled with tears due to the grief over the child. || 163 ||

If there was anything that helped them forget their grief, it was Janaki, who was very beautiful and possessed auspicious childish qualities. || 164 ||

**Malini Vritta**

She, who is the delight of women, is constantly growing in the lap of her mother.  She adorns the group of directions with the brilliance of her vast beauty.  She appears like Lakshmi, who has obtained many lotuses.  Her neck is beautiful, her face is white with pure laughter, and her eyes are like lotuses. || 165 ||

The treasure of virtues, which produces happiness for all devotees, is born in her in great abundance.  Therefore, she, who is very beautiful and adorned with excellent qualities, is called Sita, because she is equal to the earth. || 166 ||

Her face has conquered the moon, her hands are like the shade of leaves, and her hair is like the brilliance of white gems. || 167 ||

**nama**

Then the king of Magadha, astonished by the beautiful story, asked the Ganadhara, with renewed respect, "What great virtue did King Janaka see in Rama, that he decided to give him his daughter?"

The Ganadhara, whose teeth shone twice as bright due to the touch of his hands, spoke words that brought joy to the heart. "Listen, O King, I will tell you about Rama, who performed actions without any blemish. The wise King Janaka decided to give him his daughter for this reason."

"To the south of the Vijayaardha mountain and to the north of Mount Kailasa, there are many countries, separated by intervening lands. Among them is a country called Ardhavavar, where people are unrestrained and disrespectful, full of deceitful people and teeming with terrible Mlechchhas."

"In this country, there is a city called Mayuramala, resembling the city of Yama. In this city, a king named Antarangatam ruled."

"From east to west, there were thousands of Mlechchhas, like pigeons, parrots, Kambojas, and Mankanas. They were protected by many kinds of fierce armies, equipped with various weapons. They worshipped Antarangatam with great devotion, along with all their resources."

"These Mlechchhas, devoid of compassion, came to destroy the Aryan countries, their movements swift and fierce."

"Then, these Mlechchhas, like locusts, prepared to invade King Janaka's country."

"King Janaka quickly sent his warriors to Ayodhya. They reached King Dasharatha and informed him of Antarangatam's arrival. They said, 'O King, King Janaka, who loves his people, informs you that the earth is covered by the wheel of the Pauliinda, a foreign king.'" 

Page #34:
---------------------------
The Aryavarta has been devastated by the Mlechchas, the world is filled with their tyranny. They are determined to make all the people of one caste.  ||14|| When the people are being destroyed, what is the purpose of our lives? Think about it, what should we do? Where should we go? ||15|| Should we stay with our friends in some fort, or should we seek refuge in the mountains like Nandi, Kalinda, or Vipula? ||16|| Or should we go to Nikunjgiri with all our army and stop the approaching enemy army? ||17|| Or is it too difficult to save this bewildered people, filled with the righteous, cows, and Shravakas, even if we have to give up our lives? ||18|| Therefore, O King! I tell you, since you protect the earth, this kingdom is yours. And O Great One! You are the lord of the world. ||19|| All the Shravakas and other righteous people worship you with devotion. They perform five types of Yajnas with old grains like rice, which are devoid of the power to sprout. ||20|| The Nirgrantha Munis, endowed with the qualities of liberation, forbearance, etc., are devoted to meditation and perform the highest austerities, which are the means to liberation. ||21|| Great offerings and abhishekas are performed in the temples of the Jinas, who have destroyed their karmas. ||22|| When the people are protected, all this is protected. And when all this is protected, the kings achieve the three goals of Dharma, Artha, and Kama in this world and the next. ||23|| A king who is the owner of a vast treasury and who happily protects the earth, and who does not get discouraged even when defeated by the enemy's army, and who protects those who are free from violence and who give donations in Yajnas, such a king gets back his enjoyments. ||24-25|| On this earth, humans have the right to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. These rights are obtained by humans who are protected by the kings. How else can they be obtained? ||26|| People find happiness in the shadow of the king's strong arms. The wise ascetics meditate on their own selves, free from any attachment. ||27||

The Twenty-Seventh Chapter

The people who take refuge in a country live happily and the learned residents of the ashram remain free from anxiety. ||27|| The king receives one-sixth of the merit of the austerities performed by the holy men who take refuge in his country. ||28||

Hearing all this, King Dasharatha immediately summoned Rama and was eager to give him the kingdom. ||29|| The ministers, all excited, came together, accompanied by elephants and horses, the sound of loud drums filling the air. ||30|| The valiant warriors, their bodies shining, arrived, carrying golden pitchers filled with water and their weapons strapped to their waists. ||31|| Women, adorned in beautiful attire and with the sound of their anklets ringing, arrived carrying chests filled with clothes and ornaments. ||32|| Seeing all this preparation, Rama asked, "What is this?" King Dasharatha replied, "My son, you will rule this earth." ||33|| "A hostile army has arrived here, one that is invincible even to the gods. I will go and conquer them for the welfare of the people." ||34|| Then, Rama, with lotus-like eyes, said to King Dasharatha, "Father, why are you angry in this situation?" ||35|| "What can be achieved by those wicked, speechless, animal-like beings, for whose sake you are going to battle?" ||36|| "Even the best elephants are not disturbed by the opposition of mice, nor does the sun strive to burn cotton." ||37|| "It is appropriate for me to go there. Please give me your command." Hearing this, the king, his body filled with joy, embraced Rama and said, ||38|| "My dear Rama, you are still a child, your body is delicate, and your eyes are like lotuses. How can you conquer them? I do not believe it." ||39|| Rama replied, "Even a small fire, born just now, can burn a vast forest. What is the use of the big ones? ||40|| A young sun alone destroys the great darkness and the brilliance of the stars. What is the use of its power?" ||41||

In the Puranas, King Dasharatha, his hair standing on end with joy, was once again filled with both immense delight and sorrow, tears streaming down his face. ||42|| This is the nature of Kshatriyas, whose very essence is to renounce their possessions and be ever ready to embark on battle or even sacrifice their lives. ||43|| He pondered, "As long as life remains, even if a creature experiences the greatest suffering, it does not readily embrace death." ||44|| While lost in these thoughts, his sons, Rama and Lakshmana, bowed at their father's lotus feet and stepped outside. ||45|| They were masters of all weapons, proficient in all scriptures, adorned with every auspicious mark, and their very sight brought joy to all. ||46|| Accompanied by their four-fold army, brimming with glory, and radiating their own brilliance, they mounted their chariots and set out. ||47|| King Janaka, accompanied by his brother, had already departed. There were only two yojanas between him and the enemy army. ||48|| Like celestial bodies entering a cloud formation, the valiant warriors of King Janaka, unable to bear the enemy's roar, charged into the Mlechchha horde. ||49|| A terrifying battle ensued, sending shivers down the spines of all, with a vast array of weapons and a clash of Aryan and Mlechchha warriors. ||50|| Seeing his brother Kanaka in dire straits, King Janaka, filled with rage, urged his formidable elephant corps forward. ||51|| The Mlechchha army, vast and fearsome, repeatedly broke through and surrounded King Janaka from all sides. ||52|| At that moment, Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana, arrived on the scene. Their beautiful eyes beheld the enemy's immense and terrifying army. ||53|| Upon seeing Rama's white umbrella, the enemy army crumbled like darkness dissipating before the full moon. ||54|| Rama reassured Janaka, whose armor had been shattered by a barrage of arrows, just as Dharma, the life force of the universe, sustains all beings. ||55|| 

Page #37:

## Chapter 19

The distressed creature is given reassurance. || 55 ||

Ramachandra, mounted on a chariot drawn by swift horses, his body shining with armor, adorned with garlands and earrings, || 56 || with a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other, his banner bearing the mark of a lion, a large umbrella waving over his head, his mind as steadfast as the earth, || 57 || entered the vast army playfully, like a beloved of the people, shining like the sun with its rays, surrounded by valiant warriors. || 58 ||

Filled with joy, Rama protected his father Janaka and his brother Kanaka, as per the rules, and destroyed the enemy army as an elephant destroys a banana grove. || 59 ||

Just as a cloud driven by the wind pours rain on the ocean, Lakshmana showered the enemy ranks with arrows that reached their ears. || 60 ||

He rained down extremely sharp chakra, shakti, kanaka, shula, krakacha, and vajradanda weapons. || 61 ||

Just as trees are cut down by falling axes, the aforementioned weapons, released from the arms of Saumitri, fell here and there, cutting the bodies of the Mlechchas. || 62 ||

In this army of the Shabaras, many warriors had their chests pierced by arrows, and thousands fell with their arms and necks severed. || 63 ||

Although the army of the enemies of the people turned back from Lakshmana, he continued to pursue them from behind. || 64 ||

Seeing Saumitri, the king of the deer, whom no one could stop, the Mlechcha tigers, like lions, were filled with fear from all sides. || 65 ||

At that time, those Mlechchas were making a terrifying sound with the roar of large drums, holding many bows, swords, and chakra weapons, standing in rows in groups. || 66 ||

Some Mlechchas were wearing red turbans, some were holding knives, and some were wearing bodies of various colors. || 67 ||

Some were as black as ground collyrium, some were as bright as dry leaves, some were like mud, and some were like copper in color. || 68 ||

Most of them had gems tied in their waistbands, wore garments of leaves, their bodies were smeared with various metals, and they had made garlands of flowers. || 69 ||

1. Shula krakacha etc. || 2. Mlechcha dehanni krityante etc. || 3. Nyapatyante || 4. Shushka etc. || 

Page #38:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Their teeth were like dice, their bellies like large pots, and they were adorned like blooming Kutaja trees amidst the army. ||70|| Others were fierce Savaras, wielding fearsome weapons, with thick thighs, arms, and shoulders, appearing like proud Asuras. ||71|| They were merciless, eaters of animal flesh, foolish, eager for the slaughter of living beings. From birth, they were perpetrators of thousands of sins. ||72|| Their flags bore the marks of boars, buffaloes, tigers, wolves, and vultures. Their vassals were also terrifying, adorned with various vehicles, cloths, and umbrellas. ||73|| They were accompanied by swift foot soldiers, who had caused darkness in many battles, were as fierce as ocean waves, and made various terrifying sounds. ||74|| The Savara-like clouds, filled with anger, surrounded the Lakshmana-like mountain, driven by their vassal-like wind. ||75|| Just as a mighty elephant charges to destroy a herd of bulls, Lakshmana rushed to destroy them all. ||76|| As Lakshmana ran, they were thrown into disarray, crushed by their own people, and fell to the earth. Many warriors, their bodies mangled by fear, fled in all directions. ||77||
Then, the king, the inner-most, stopped the army and stood facing Lakshmana with all his forces. ||78|| As soon as he arrived, he engaged in a fierce battle and broke Lakshmana's bow with arrows raining down continuously. ||79|| Lakshmana was disarmed, his chariot destroyed, just as he was about to draw his sword. Seeing this, Rama, with the speed of the wind, drove his chariot forward. ||80|| Another chariot was quickly brought for Lakshmana, and Rama, like fire consuming a forest, set the enemy army ablaze. ||81|| He pierced many with showers of arrows, cut down many with golden tomahawks, and with his chakra, he severed the heads of many, causing their lips to curl. ||82||

## Twenty-Seventh Chapter

The army of the Mlechchas, filled with fear, was destroyed, their standards, umbrellas, bows and arrows scattered everywhere.  ||83||

Just as a virtuous person destroys the Kshayas in a moment, so too did Rama, who was free from all blemishes, destroy all the Mlechchas in the blink of an eye. ||84||

The Mlechcha king, who had come with an army as vast as the ocean, fled with only ten horses, filled with fear. ||85||

Thinking, "What is the use of killing these defeated and impotent men?", Rama, having accomplished his task, returned happily with Lakshmana. ||86||

The Mlechchas, filled with fear, abandoned their desire for victory and sought refuge in the Sahya and Vindhya mountains, making peace. ||87||

Just as snakes are afraid of Garuda, so too were the Mlechchas afraid of Rama. They subsisted on roots, fruits, and tubers, abandoning all their evil ways. ||88||

Then, Rama, whose body remained peaceful in battle, went to see his father, Janaka, along with his younger brother, Lakshmana, while Lakshmana, whose body remained peaceful in battle, went to see his father, Janaka, along with his younger brother, Kanaka. ||89||

The entire populace, filled with supreme joy and wonder, engaged in merrymaking. The whole earth shone with splendor, like the age of righteousness. ||90||

Just as the sky is adorned with stars free from the covering of snow, so too is the world adorned with men devoted to Dharma, Artha, and Kama. ||91||

Gautama Swami said to the king, "O King! It was because of this great virtue that King Janaka, pleased, decided to give his daughter, Janaki, the beauty of the world, to Rama." ||92||

Padma Purana
Upajati Vrittam
What is the use of speaking much on this subject? O Shrenik! It is certain that the karma of men is the cause of their association or separation from noble persons. ||93||
That great soul, Ramachandra, endowed with extraordinary qualities and blessed with supreme glory, was shining throughout the world, just as the sun shines with its rays. ||94||
Thus ends the twenty-seventh chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which describes the defeat of the Mlechchas. ||27||

## Chapter Twenty-Eight

Seeing such a feat, Narada was filled with great wonder. He could not find contentment anywhere without the story of Rama. ||1||

He had heard that King Janaka, renowned throughout the world, wished to give his daughter Sita to Rama. ||2||

Upon hearing this news, he thought, "Let me see this girl, what kind of auspicious qualities does she possess, that she is destined for Rama?" ||3||

With this thought, Narada arrived at Sita's palace at a time when she was alone, holding a lotus bud near her breast, contemplating, "Is this like my beloved?" ||4||

Narada, whose heart was pure and who longed to see Sita, ascended to her palace at that moment. ||5||

Seeing Narada's form, reflected in the mirror, adorned with matted hair and a fearsome crown, Sita was overwhelmed with fear. ||6||

"Mother! Who is this coming here?" she exclaimed, her voice trembling, and rushed into her inner chambers. ||7||

Narada, filled with curiosity, followed her, but the women guarding the entrance forcefully stopped him. ||8||

While a great quarrel ensued between Narada and the women, the sound reached the men, armed with swords and bows. ||9||

"Seize him! Seize him! Who is he? Who is he?" they shouted. Seeing these men, their lips clenched, armed and ready to kill, Narada was filled with extreme fear. His body trembled violently, and his hair stood on end. Somehow, he flew up into the sky and landed on Mount Kailasa. ||10-11||

He thought, "Alas! I have been in great distress. I have escaped as if I have been reborn. Just as a bird, struck by fire, escapes from a great storm..." ||12||

The twenty-eighth parva observes silence, smiles, and speaks frequently. He suddenly gets up, walks aimlessly, and returns. ||26|| Then, like one possessed by a spirit, his actions were similar. The wise understood the reason for his anxiety. ||27|| They said to each other, "Who painted this maiden? Where is this painting kept in this house? It seems to be the work of Narada." ||28|| Then, hearing that the young man was deeply troubled by his actions, Narada, without hesitation, appeared before his relatives. ||29|| They greeted him with respect, offered him worship, and bowed down. "O sage, tell us, where did you see this maiden? What kind of being is she?" ||30|| "Is she a Naga princess, a celestial being, or a mortal woman who has come to this world? Have you seen her somehow?" ||31|| Narada, bearing utmost humility, said, bowing his head in wonder, "There is a city called Mithila, extremely beautiful, in this middle world. In it, there lives a king named Janaka, the son of Indraketu. ||33|| His beloved, who binds his heart, is named Videha. Their daughter, the essence of their lineage, is named Sita." ||34|| Having informed them thus, he said to the young man, "O child, do not be disheartened. This maiden is attainable for you." ||35|| "You are in this state just by seeing her form. Who can describe her gestures and illusions?" ||36|| "It is no wonder that she has captivated your heart. She can even captivate the minds of sages who are firmly established in meditation on Dharma." ||37|| "I have only depicted her form in the painting. Her beauty is inherent in her, not found elsewhere." ||38|| "She stands like a wave in the ocean of radiance born from her youthful bloom, supported by her breasts like pitchers." ||39||

Hearing this news, Chandragati, the Vidyadhara, was troubled. He came to his wife and spoke to his son thus: "Son, be calm and perform all your duties, including eating. I accept the girl who resides in your heart."

28

Consoling his son, Chandragati spoke to his wife in private, bearing joy, sorrow, and wonder: "My dear, how can we, the Vidyadharas, associate with the earth-dwellers, abandoning the incomparable daughters of our own kind?"

29

"Furthermore, how can we go to the home of an earth-dweller? Even if we beg, what will be the glory of our faces if he doesn't give us his daughter?"

30

"Therefore, I will bring the girl's father here by some means. There is no other way."

31

"My lord, you know what is right and wrong. But I must say that your words are pleasing to my heart."

32

Then the king, with great respect, called his servant, Chapalavega, and informed him of the whole matter.

33

Pleased with the king's command, Chapalavega quickly went towards Mithila, like a young, joyful swan going towards a fragrant lotus.

34

Descending from the sky, he assumed the form of a beautiful horse, ready to frighten the cows, buffaloes, horses, and elephants.

35

Wherever he went to cause destruction, a loud cry of distress arose. King Janaka heard the horse's actions from the crowd.

36

Not only did he hear, but filled with joy, anxiety, and curiosity, he went out of the city to see the horse's actions. He saw the horse, young and full of vigor.

37

The horse was very tall, captivating the mind, with excellent qualities shining on his body. He had a great swirl on his right side, his face and belly were lean, he was very strong, and he was striking the earth with the front part of his hooves. 

Page #46:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it was as if a drum was being beaten. Ordinary people were unable to mount it, and its reins trembled. ||66|| Then, filled with pure joy, King Janaka repeatedly asked the people present, "Let it be known, whose horse has become unbound?" ||67|| Then, the Brahmanas, whose minds were eager to speak kindly, said, "O King! There is no other horse equal to this one." ||68|| "Let this matter be known, among all the kings of the earth, there is no horse like this. Or, O King! Have you ever seen such a horse in all this time?" ||69|| "We know that even in the chariot of the Sun, there is no horse that can be compared to this one." ||70|| "It seems that this horse was created by the Creator, with the intention of bestowing it upon you, who have performed great austerities. So, O Lord! Accept it." ||71|| Then, that humble horse was led away, tied with two ropes, to the stable. At that time, its body was wet with saffron paste, and beautiful fly whisks were waving over it. ||72|| "One month has passed since the day this horse was captured and brought here. It has been continuously served with appropriate care." ||73|| In the meantime, a forest worker, bowing down, informed King Janaka, "O Lord! See how elephants are captured in our country." ||74|| Then, King Janaka, filled with joy, mounted his magnificent elephant and set out. The forest worker guided him along the way. Thus, King Janaka entered a large forest. ||75|| There, he saw a magnificent elephant standing on the other side of a lake, in a difficult place. He said to his charioteer, "Bring a swift horse quickly." ||76|| No sooner were the words spoken than the magical horse, whose body was trembling, was brought and stood before King Janaka. King Janaka had not yet mounted it when the horse took him up into the sky. ||77|| Seeing this, those who were suddenly terrified and whose minds were filled with wonder, 

Page #47:
---------------------------
The twenty-eighth chapter: Then, crossing many rivers, mountains, countries, and forests, the horse, which could not be stopped even by the mind, went forward. ||79|| Not far from there, he saw a tall, shining palace. Attracted by it, he climbed up a large tree and clung to its branch. ||80|| Descending from the tree, he rested for a while, filled with wonder. Then, walking on foot, he went a short distance. ||81|| He saw a very tall, golden-colored fort, with a gate adorned with the finest jewels. ||82|| He saw many kinds of trees, entwined with creepers, laden with fruits and flowers, and adorned with various birds. ||83|| He also saw palaces, resembling clouds at dusk, situated in a circle, as if they were diligently serving the king of palaces, the royal palace. ||84|| Then, holding his sword in his right hand, he entered the gate, fearless like a lion. ||85|| There, he saw many kinds of flowers blooming everywhere, stairs made of jewels and gold, and pools of water as clear as crystal. ||86|| He also saw large, fragrant mandapas of jasmine, with their leaves swaying and bees humming a sweet melody. ||87|| Then, with his wide, beautiful eyes, he looked through the dense network of Madhavi creepers and saw a beautiful temple, adorned with pearl-like lattices, with windows made of jewels, supported by thousands of golden pillars, filled with various forms, shining like the peak of Mount Meru, and with a foundation as strong as a diamond. ||88-90|| Seeing it, he thought: 

Page #48:

Padmapurana
Is this the abode of the Nagendra, risen from the netherworld? Or is it the abode of Indra, stolen by the Daityas? Or is it the abode of the Nagendra, risen from the netherworld, whose parts were broken by the rays of the sun for some reason? ||12||
Oh, how much I have been benefited by that good horse! I have never seen such a beautiful temple before. ||13||
Thinking thus, King Janaka entered that beautiful temple and saw the Jina. ||14||
The Jina was as white as the flame of a fire, his face was like the full moon, he was seated on a lotus seat, he was very tall, he was wearing a crown of matted hair, he was adorned with eight auspicious signs, he was worshipped with golden lotuses, his radiance was enhanced by various jewels, and he was seated on a high throne. ||15-16||
Then, King Janaka, whose body was trembling with excitement, folded his hands and bowed his head, and with great devotion, he prostrated himself before the Jina. His devotion was so great that he fainted. ||17||
After regaining consciousness, he offered a beautiful and well-composed praise. Then, he sat down, filled with wonder. ||18||
Meanwhile, the Vidyaadhara named Chapalavega, who had taken the form of a horse and abducted Janaka, was very happy at his success. He quickly gathered all his magic and, becoming a sword-wielding Vidyaadhara, reached the city of Rathnapur. ||19||
He bowed to his master and said, "King Janaka has been brought here and has been lodged in the Jina temple, which is surrounded by a beautiful forest." ||20||
Hearing of Janaka's arrival, Chandragati was overjoyed. Then, Chandragati, who was generous and had many vehicles, along with his close associates, went to the Jina temple, riding in a chariot called Manora, carrying the best of offerings. ||21-22||
Seeing that great and brilliant army, with its loud trumpets and conch shells, Janaka was somewhat frightened. ||23||
Then, he saw among those men, vehicles of various kinds, such as lions, elephants, tigers, snakes, and swans. ||24|| 

Page #49:
---------------------------
The twenty-eighth chapter. Surely these people are Vidya-bhṛtas, I have heard that they dwell on the peak of Vijayagiri. ||105|| In the midst of this army, seated in his own aerial chariot, a certain Vidya-dhara king shines with supreme brilliance. ||106|| Thus, while the king was absorbed in thought, the foremost of the Daityas, filled with joy and with a bowed form, arrived at the Caitya-bhavana. ||107|| Seeing the Daitya king, whose presence was both terrifying and peaceful, Janaka stood still, meditating on something, in the midst of his throne. ||108|| With devotion, he also offered the best worship to the moon-chariot, and bowing down according to the proper procedure, he uttered the highest praise of the Jinas. ||109|| Placing a Vīṇā, whose sound was most pleasing, on his lap, he sang the praises of the Jinas, filled with great devotion. ||110||

In the four-line verse, he said: "O noble ones! Always bow down to the Jina-indra, who is the bestower of blessings on the three worlds, whose praise is sung by those whose minds are fixed on the method of performing the highest worship, who is bowed down to by the host of Indra and the other gods, and who is the possessor of inexhaustible and imperishable happiness. ||111|| O virtuous ones! Always bow down with your mind, your words, and your head to the Lord Ṛṣabha, who is endowed with excellent fortune, who is the bestower of blessings, who is the best, who is imperishable, who is possessed of supreme knowledge, and by bowing down to whom all sins are destroyed. ||112|| Bow down to the Jina-vara, who is supremely excellent, who has destroyed sin, who has attained the supreme state of liberation, whose feet are worshipped by all the gods and demons, and who has conquered the great enemy, anger. ||113|| I, with a devoted mind, bow down to the Jina-indra, whose body is marked by excellent signs, who has made the whole assembly of men bow down, and whose worship destroys all sins. ||114||

1. Vidya-dhara. 2. In the midst of this army, seated in his own aerial chariot. 3. Filled with joy. 4. With a bowed form. 5. Vīṇā.

In the Padma Purana,
The Daitya king sings, "He who possesses unparalleled virtues, whose form is beyond comparison, who has destroyed all evil, who is capable of removing the dense veil of sin in the Kali Yuga, and who is supremely pure, is worthy of our prostrations." (115)
Hearing this, King Janaka, who had a beautiful form, emerged from beneath the throne of the Jina, leaving behind his fear. (116)
Seeing him, Chandragati, whose mind was somewhat disturbed, asked, "Who are you, residing in this desolate place, amidst the Jina temple?" (117)
"Are you the lord of the Naga Kumaras, or the king of the Vidyadharas? Tell me, my friend, from where have you come, and what is your name?" (118)
"I am Janaka, from the city of Mithila. I was brought here by a magical horse, the king of the sky." (119)
Hearing this, both their hearts were filled with joy, and they greeted each other with folded hands, sitting down as friends. (120)
After staying for a while, they shared their stories with each other, and honored each other. Thus, they gained mutual trust. (121)
Then, interrupting the conversation, Chandragati said, "I am fortunate to have seen you, the king of Mithila." (122)
"O King, I have heard from many people that you have a daughter with auspicious signs." (123)
"Please give her to my son, Bhamandala. I consider myself supremely fortunate to be connected with you." (124)
King Janaka replied, "O King of the Vidyadharas, all this could have been, but she has already been promised to Rama, the eldest son of King Dasharatha. I am helpless." (125)
Chandragati, his friend, asked, "Why has she been promised to Rama?" Janaka replied, "If you are curious, listen." (126)

My Mithilapuri, filled with wealth, grain, cows, buffaloes, and countless jewels, was attacked by wicked, half-demon-like Mlechchas. ||127|| They oppressed all the people, stole their wealth, and destroyed the religious rituals and observances of the great-souled Shravakas. ||128|| Then, a great battle ensued, and Rama, protecting me and my younger brother, defeated all those Mlechchas, who were invincible even to the gods. ||129|| Rama's younger brother, Lakshmana, is also a great warrior, equal to Indra in power, and always follows Rama's commands with great humility. ||130|| If those two brothers had not defeated that army of Mlechchas, then this entire earth would have been filled with them. ||131|| Those Mlechchas were devoid of wisdom, like diseases that afflict people, or like terrible calamities, extremely frightening and poisonous. ||132|| Having obtained those two sons, full of virtues and loving their people, King Dasharatha enjoyed the pleasures of his kingdom like Indra. ||133|| In his kingdom, now ruled by wise and valiant kings, even the wind cannot take anything from the prosperous people, let alone other humans. ||134|| Thinking about how to repay them for their kindness, I am filled with anxiety, and I cannot sleep, neither at night nor during the day. ||135|| There is no one equal to Rama, who protected my life, let alone someone who could repay him for his kindness. ||136|| Overwhelmed by his great kindness, and unable to repay him, I consider myself like a blade of grass, engrossed in the pursuit of worldly pleasures. ||137|| Seeing my daughter, Shubha, full of youthful beauty, my sorrow lessened, even in the midst of my grief. ||138|| I resolved to give her to Rama, the most powerful of men, and like a boat, she carried me across the ocean of sorrow. ||139|| Then, the Vidyadharas, with faces shrouded in darkness, said, "Oh, how unbecoming it is for a human being to have such a mind!" ||140||

## The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

The Tirthankaras, the Chakravartis, the Narayanas, and the Balabhadra, who are worthy of worship by the three worlds, are born in this land. How can this land be considered despicable? ||15||

O Vidhyadharas! Tell me, have you ever seen, even in your dreams, the attainment of the five auspicious signs by men in your land? ||155||

Those who were born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, who considered the world as insignificant as a cow dung, who never saw another's umbrella, who were rich in great jewels, whose generosity was praised by Indra, and who were oceans of virtues, many such accomplished kings have been on earth. ||156-157||

In the same Ikshvaku dynasty, King Dasharatha was born to the great King Anaranya and Queen Sumangala. ||158||

He who can sacrifice his life for the welfare of the world, all people follow his commands as if they were the commands of the serpent king. ||159||

He has four queens, all radiant with beauty and virtues, who are like the great goddesses of fortune, well-adorned and of excellent character. ||160||

Not only that, he has five hundred wives, whose faces surpass the moon, and who captivate his heart with their actions. ||161||

He has a son named Padma (Rama), whose body is embraced by Lakshmi, who has surpassed the sun in brilliance, the moon in fame, Mount Meru in steadfastness, and Indra in beauty, who can even conquer the Chakravarti Mahapadma in valor, and who is adorned with the best of ornaments. ||162-163||

His younger brother is Lakshmana, whose body is the abode of Lakshmi, and whose bow makes enemies flee in terror. ||164||

Vidhyadharas fly in the sky, but even crows fly in the sky. What is special about them? One should focus on virtues, that is, consider virtues. What is the essence of magic? ||165||

What about you? Even men born on earth make Indras humble, and when they bow, they have to rub their heads on the ground. ||166||

After Janaka said this, the Vidhyadharas, after consulting among themselves in private, said...

Padma Purana
You are making a vain noise by saying "Padma is excellent, Lakshmana is excellent." If you have any doubt in my words, then be certain of this. ||168||
O King! Listen to my words. This is the bow called Vajravartta, and this is the bow called Sagaraavartta. These two bows are protected by the gods. ||169||
If Rama and Lakshmana are able to string these bows, then we will know their strength. What is the use of saying more? ||170||
Rama can string the Vajravartta bow and take the girl. If they are unable to string the said bow, then you will see that we will forcibly bring her here. ||171||
After saying "Alright", Janaka accepted the challenge of the Vidyadharas, but seeing those difficult bows, he felt some anxiety in his mind. ||172||
Then, after offering worship and praise to the Jinaendras with devotion, the two bows were also worshipped with gada, hala, and other weapons. ||173||
Those valiant Vidyadharas, along with those bows and King Janaka, set out towards Mithila, and Chandragati Vidyadhara also set out towards Rathnapur. ||174||
Then, King Janaka entered his palace, which was beautifully decorated and filled with people celebrating auspicious occasions. The citizens had a good view of Janaka as he entered. ||175||
The Vidyadharas, who were filled with immense pride, stayed outside the city, having built an armory and surrounded it. ||176||
Janaka, whose body was filled with sorrow and grief, ate a little food and then lay down on his bed, overwhelmed with worry. He had no enthusiasm. ||177||
Although he was being fanned by excellent women, who were full of humility and grace, with chamaras like the rays of the moon, he was letting out very uneven, hot, and long breaths. Seeing his condition, Queen Videha, who was filled with various emotions, said, ||178-179||
"O beloved! Where did you go, and did you see a woman there, whose separation has brought you to this state?" ||180||
1. Opposition. 2. Anxiety in the mind. 3. This is the name of Janaka's wife. 4. Who was seen by him.

## The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

"She is a common woman, devoid of the qualities of a wife. This is why she does not show compassion to you, who are burning with love." (181)

"Oh, Lord! Please tell me the place where I can bring her to you. Your sorrow is causing me and all beings great pain." (182)

"With such great fortune, why does she not desire you? This is why you are so restless." (183)

"Rise and perform all the actions befitting a king. If you have a body, you will have many desired women." (184)

Hearing this, the king said to his beloved, who was dearer to him than life itself, "My heart is troubled for another reason. Why are you causing her such distress?" (185)

"Oh, Goddess! You are speaking without knowing the circumstances that have led me to this state." (186)

"I was taken to the Vijayachal mountain by that magical horse. There, the king of the Vidyadharas released me on this condition: if Rama can string the Vajravarta bow, then this maiden will be his; otherwise, she will be my son's." (187-188)

"Due to the influence of my karma, or perhaps out of fear, I, this unfortunate soul, accepted that condition." (189)

"That bow, along with another bow called the Samudravarta, has been brought by the fierce Vidyadharas and is stationed outside the city." (190)

"That bow is like a blazing thunderbolt, and its brilliance makes it difficult to look at. Therefore, I believe that even Indra would not be able to string it." (191)

"It seems like the wrathful Yama himself. Even without being drawn, it makes a sound, and even without a string, it is terrifying." (192)

"If Rama cannot string that bow, then the Vidyadharas will surely take my daughter away, just as birds snatch meat from the mouth of a jackal." (193)

In the Padma Purana, 

Upon hearing this, Videha's eyes filled with tears, and she suddenly remembered her abducted child. || 195 || She was afflicted by the sorrow of the past and the future, and like a cuckoo, she cried out, her eyes pouring forth tears. || 196 || With a mind overwhelmed, she lamented, her words dissolving the hearts of her relatives. || 197 || "O Lord, what great wrong have I done to the divine, that he is not satisfied with my son and now seeks to take my daughter?" || 198 || "This little girl is the sole support of my love and yours, and she is the beloved of my brothers, relatives, and family." || 199 || "I, a sinner, have not yet found an end to one sorrow, and another has come to stand before me." || 200 || 

Seeing Videha immersed in a whirlpool of sorrow and weeping pitifully, the king, himself overwhelmed with grief, controlled his tears and said, "My dear, your weeping is in vain. It is the karma earned in a previous life that makes the entire world dance. This is the greatest dance master." || 201-202 || "Or perhaps, while I was careless, some wicked person abducted the child. But now I am vigilant. Let's see who is capable of taking my daughter!" || 203 || "My dear, I asked you, adhering to the principle of consulting with loved ones. I know this will bring happiness." || 204 || 

Consoled by these meaningful words of her husband, Videha, with great difficulty, subdued her grief. || 205 || 

Then, on the outskirts of the palace where the bow was kept, a vast arena was constructed, and all the kings of the earth were invited for the Swayamvara. || 206 || A messenger was sent to Kosala, and Rama and his brothers, along with their parents, arrived and were honored by King Janaka. || 207 ||

The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

Then, on the beautiful terrace of the palace, Sita, the most beautiful, sat surrounded by seven hundred other maidens, with valiant warriors guarding her. ||208|| On all sides of the palace, all the chieftains stood, performing various playful acts, adorned with great splendor. ||209||

Then, standing before her, Kanchuki, well-versed in many scriptures, and holding a golden staff in his hand, spoke in a loud voice, saying, "O Princess! Behold, this lotus-eyed one, Padma (Rama), the eldest son of King Dasharatha, the ruler of Ayodhya. ||210-211|| This is Lakshmana, his younger brother, blessed with fortune and radiant with splendor. This is Bharata, the mighty-armed one, and this is Shatrughna, known for his beautiful deeds. ||212|| With these sons, whose hearts are oceans of virtues, King Dasharatha rules the earth, having destroyed all the seeds of fear from it. ||213|| This is Harivahana, wise and radiant like a cloud, this is the handsome Chitra-ratha, and this is the powerful Durmukha. ||214|| This is Shrisanjay, this is Jay, this is Bhanu, this is Suprabha, this is Mandara, this is Budha, this is Vishala, this is Shridhara, this is Vira, this is Bandhu, this is Bhadrabala, and this is Shikhi, the peacock prince. ||215|| These, and many other princes are present here. All of them are mighty, adorned with great splendor, born of pure lineage, possessing a radiance like the moon, filled with enthusiasm, adorned with virtues like ornaments, endowed with great wealth, and skilled in various sciences. ||216-217|| This is his elephant, as big as a mountain, this is his tall horse, this is his spacious chariot, and this is his wonder-working warrior. ||218|| This is the lord of Sankashyapura, this is the ruler of Randhra-pura, this is the king of Gavidhmad, this is the lord of Nandnika. ||219|| This is the ruler of Surapura, this is the king of Kundapura, this is the king of Magadha, and this is the lord of Kampilya. ||220|| This king is born of the Ikshvaku dynasty, this is born of the Hari-vamsa, this is the delight of the Kuru clan, and this is King Bhoj. ||221||

Thus, these great men, adorned with such descriptions, are present here. This test has been arranged for your sake. ||222|| 

Page #58:
---------------------------
## Chapter 40

The Padma Purana states that the man who can string this Vajravart bow is the most excellent man, and he shall be chosen by you, O Kumari! (223)

Those who were proud and boasted about themselves, adorned with beautiful ornaments, were brought to the Vajravart bow by the attendant. (224)

As the bow approached the princes, it released fire, resembling a flash of lightning, with hissing serpents. (225)

Some princes, blinded by the flames of the bow, covered their eyes with their hands and quickly retreated. (226)

Others, seeing the serpents, stood still, their bodies trembling, their eyes closed. (227)

Some were overcome with fever and fell to the ground, some lost their voices, some fled quickly, and some fainted. (228)

Some were blown away by the serpents' breath like dry leaves, some became stiff, and some were left with their pride extinguished. (229)

Some said, "If we can return to our own place, we will give alms to living beings. O God, give me two feet, give me the strength to run away!" (230)

Others said, "If we survive, we will serve other women. What use is this beautiful one?" (231)

Some said, "Surely some wicked person has used this great illusion to kill the kings." (232)

Others said, "What use do we have for lust? We will spend our time in celibacy like the virtuous." (233)

Then, those who desired the excellent bow, like rutting elephants, approached it with slow, heavy steps. (234)

The virtuous Rama, with his beautiful ornaments, approached the bow, gentle and respectful like a student to his teacher. (235) 

Page #59:
---------------------------
The twenty-eighth festival was then celebrated with great enthusiasm. Rama, having donned his armor, lifted his bow and let out a mighty roar.  The peacocks, mistaking the sound for the roar of thunderclouds, danced with joy, spreading their feathers in a wide circle. The sun, like a blazing wheel, shone brightly, and the sky seemed to be filled with golden dust. The gods in the heavens cried out, "Well done! Well done!" and many celestial beings danced, showering flowers. 

Then Rama, with a mighty effort, drew back the bow, which had been made by the celestial smith, Atni, and which resonated with a sound that filled the entire universe. It was as if the bow was a wheel, spinning and turning. All the people, their senses overwhelmed, their minds filled with fear, felt as if they were caught in a whirlwind. Sita, her eyes shining brighter than a lotus petal stirred by the wind, gazed at Rama, her gaze like the arrow of Cupid. Her body trembled with excitement, and she wore a beautiful garland. With a shy smile, she approached Rama. 

Standing beside Sita, Rama shone with such beauty that anyone who tried to compare him to anything else would be considered lacking in taste. He was truly incomparable. Having removed the bowstring, Rama sat down with Sita, his demeanor filled with humility. Sita, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement, felt a strange sense of wonder as she looked at Rama's face. 

At that moment, Lakshmana, with a mighty roar, drew back his bow, Sagara-avarta, which sounded like a raging sea. The celestial beings, seeing Lakshmana aiming his arrow, cried out, "Oh, no! Oh, no!" and showered him with flowers.  Rama, having drawn his bow, which was as strong as the celestial smith's hammer, and which resonated with a mighty sound, stood beside Sita, his demeanor filled with humility.

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, Chandravardhana, the Vidyaadhara, gave eighteen daughters to Vikranta, who was also a Vidyaadhara, as they were not yet mature. ||250|| The Vidyaadharas, filled with fear, returned and told the news, upon which Chandragati, the Vidyaadhara, was filled with worry. ||251|| Seeing this news, Bharat, who was filled with wonder and had a change of heart, began to grieve for himself. ||252|| He thought, "We both have the same lineage and the same father. But these two, Rama and Lakshmana, have attained such wonders, while I, due to my lack of merit, have not." ||253|| "Or perhaps, why should I be consumed by the desire for another's wealth? Surely, I did not perform good deeds in my previous life." ||254|| "A woman whose radiance is like the petals of a lotus, as bright as Lakshmi herself, can only be obtained by a man of great merit." ||255|| Kekaya, who was skilled in all arts and possessed great knowledge, knowing her son's actions, spoke sweetly to King Dasharatha, saying, "O King, I see Bharat's mind filled with sorrow. Therefore, do something so that he does not become detached." ||256-257|| "Here, there is a king named Kanaka, the younger brother of Janaka. He has a daughter named Lokasundari, born to his queen, Suprabha." ||258|| "Announce a Swayamvara again and arrange for her to be given to Bharat, so that he does not entertain any other thoughts." ||259|| Saying, "Very well," King Dasharatha conveyed this message to the wise King Kanaka. ||260|| King Kanaka, saying, "As you command," immediately summoned the kings who had gone to their homes the previous day. ||261|| Then, amidst the kings seated in their respective places, Bharat, who was shining like the moon amidst the stars, was adorned with garlands of flowers. Kanaki, the daughter of Kanaka, who was radiant like gold, chose Bharat, just as Subhadra chose him. ||262-263|| 

Page #61:
---------------------------
The twenty-eighth chapter reveals the extreme disparity in the karma of the Shrenikas. For, though enlightened, Bharat was again captivated by a woman. ||26|| All the kings, ashamed, went to their respective places, engaging in idle talk among their kin. ||265|| As the saying goes, "As the deed is done, so is the fruit enjoyed." One who sows barley cannot reap rice. ||266|| In Mithila, adorned with banners, toranas, and garlands, with wide, flower-filled market streets, and homes filled with the sounds of conch shells and trumpets, the wedding of the two took place with great celebration. ||267-268|| At that time, the people were so filled with wealth that the word "give" (dehi) was completely lost, as if swallowed by a great deluge. ||269|| The kings, with noble minds, who remained to witness the wedding ceremony, received the highest honor and returned to their respective homes. ||270|| 

Then, those whose fame spread throughout the world, who were immersed in the ocean of supreme beauty, who had offered their parents joy-filled wealth, whose bodies were adorned with exquisite jewels, whose armies were busy with various types of mounts, and whose trumpets sounded like the vast ocean, the sons and daughters-in-law of Dasharatha, entered Ayodhya with great splendor. ||271-272|| At that time, to see the daughters-in-law with their beautiful bodies, all the townspeople, abandoning their work, rushed to the royal road with great eagerness. ||273||

1. With wide, flower-filled market streets. ||267||
2. With wealth. ||269||
3. Who are the brides and who are the grooms? ||272|| 

Page #62:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, the sons of Dasharatha, who had honored all people and whose bodies were humbled by the praise of their vast virtues, were dwelling in their palaces, enjoying great happiness. ||27||

Gautama Swami says, "O noble ones! Knowing that the fruit of good deeds is good and the fruit of bad deeds is bad, perform that commendable action which is praised by the wise, so that you may become more radiant than the sun." ||275||

Thus ends the twenty-eighth chapter of the Padma Charita, narrated by the sage Ravishena Acharya, which describes the acquisition of the Ratna Mala by Rama and Lakshmana in their Swayamvara. ||28||

## The Thirty-First Chapter

From the eighth day of the month of Ashadha, the king, eager to perform the glorification of the Jinas, began the preparations. [1]

All his beloved wives, sons, and relatives were also eager to perform the tasks related to the Jina images. [2]

Some, with great reverence, ground five-colored powders for making mandalas, while others, skilled in various creations, strung garlands. [3]

Some perfumed the water, others irrigated the earth, and some ground various kinds of fragrant substances. [4]

Some adorned the doors of the Jina temple with beautiful clothes, while others decorated the walls with the essence of various metals. [5]

Thus, the devotees, filled with devotion and joy, earned great merit by performing the worship of the Jina. [6]

Then, the king, having gathered all the best materials, performed the abhisheka of the Jinas, accompanied by the resounding sound of trumpets. [7]

After observing an eight-day fast, he performed the supreme abhisheka and offered grand worship with natural and artificial flowers. [8]

Just as Indra, along with the gods, performs the worship of the Jinas in the Nandishvara island, so too did King Dasharatha perform the worship with his entire family. [9]

After the queens returned home, the wise King Dasharatha sent the holy, peace-giving fragrant water to all. [10]

The young women quickly brought the fragrant water to the three queens, and they, with great faith, quickly applied it to their foreheads to destroy their sins. [11]

But, for Supribha, it was sent through the hands of an old woman, so it did not reach her quickly. Therefore, she was filled with great anger and sorrow. [12]

She thought, "This king's wisdom is not right, as he did not honor me by sending the fragrant water." [13] 

Page #64:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, what is the king's fault?  Perhaps in my previous life, I did not accumulate enough merit, which is why I have been subjected to such disdain.  [14] These three are virtuous and blessed with great fortune, for whom the king has lovingly sent pure and excellent scented water. [15]  For my heart, which is burned by humiliation, death is the only refuge I see now.  My suffering cannot be alleviated in any other way. [16]  Thinking this, he said to a storekeeper named Visakha, "O Bhadra, you must not tell this to anyone." [17]  I am in dire need of poison.  Therefore, if you have devotion to me, bring it quickly. [18]  The storekeeper, deeply apprehensive about the poison, delayed while searching for it.  Meanwhile, Suprabha went to her bedchamber and lay down, her body limp. [19]  The king arrived and, seeing his three beloveds without Suprabha, searched for her and quickly reached her side. [20]  He saw Suprabha, the enchantress, lying on the bed, her body covered in clothes, as if she were an Indra-dhanush (rainbow). [21]  At that moment, the storekeeper arrived and said, "O Devi, take this poison."  The king, having arrived there, heard these words. [22]  Hearing this, the king said, "O Devi, what is this?  You fool, what have you started?"  Saying this, the king pushed the storekeeper away and sat down on Suprabha's bed. [23]  Knowing that the king had arrived, Suprabha, ashamed, rose quickly and wanted to sit on the ground, but he took her in his lap. [24]  The king said, "My beloved, why have you become so angry that you are indifferent even to your own life, which is most dear to me?" [25]  The pain of death is greater than all other pains.  So tell me, what is the pain that has caused you to make death its remedy? [26]  O beloved, you are the very essence of my heart.  Therefore, O beautiful one, quickly tell me the reason so that I can remedy it. [27]  I have heard about the causes of good and bad destinies from the Jina scriptures.  Even so, your opinion is like this, which is a great darkness. [28]

## Padma Purana:

*

"The letters, brought with great difficulty to the mouth, were established in the heart. They were placed on the lips, but many of them vanished there." ||43|| "He kept spitting, moving his lips again and again, and touching his heart with the hand that had been brought with great difficulty." ||44|| "Behind his head, there were white hairs like the rays of the moon, and his beard, like a white chamara, was moving gently." ||45|| "His bones were covered with a skin as thin as a fly's wing, and his red eyes were covered by white eyebrows." ||46|| "His restless body was enveloped by a network of clearly visible veins. He had the appearance of an unfinished clay toy. He was wearing clothes with great difficulty, and his cheeks, as if struck by frost, were trembling. He was trying to speak, but his tongue was stumbling and moving with difficulty to the palate and other places. If he managed to utter even a single letter, he considered it a great celebration. He wanted to speak some letters, but instead, he uttered others. He was releasing the broken letters, which were very difficult to pronounce, like worn-out thorns, with great effort." ||47-50||

"O master, compassionate to your servants! What is my fault, old man, that you, the god adorned with the jewel of knowledge, have become angry?" ||51|| "My arms were once like the trunk of an elephant, my body was very strong and tall. My chest was broad, my shoulders were like the pillars used to tie elephants, and my body was shaped like the peak of Mount Meru. It was the powerful cause of many wonderful deeds." ||52-53|| "O god! My hands were once capable of crushing strong doors, and the kick of my foot could break even a mountain. I used to cross high and low ground with speed. O master! I used to reach my desired destination quickly, like a royal swan." ||54-55|| "O king! My vision was so strong that..." ||56||

He placed his knees on the ground and his hands in a gesture of supplication, and spoke with great difficulty. ||42|| 

Page #67:
---------------------------
The Twenty-First Chapter

My body, adorned with beautiful ornaments, was like a *Aalan* (a type of tree), attracting the eyes and minds of women.  (57)

I was pampered with the finest pleasures, thanks to the grace of your father. But now, like a treacherous friend, it has betrayed me. (58)

My hand, which once held the power to vanquish enemies, now holds a stick for support. (59)

My back is bent like a bow drawn by a valiant warrior, and my head hangs low, as if crushed by the foot of Yama (the god of death). (60)

The sounds of my voice, once clear and resonant, have faded away. It seems as if the heat of the *Ushmavarna* (sounds like 'sh', 's', 'h') has consumed them, leaving me unable to bear the heat. (61)

If I don't hold onto this stick, my life's lifeline, this decaying body will fall to the ground. (62)

My body is growing weak, my strength waning, and my enthusiasm fading. Oh King, it is a wonder that I can still breathe with this body. (63)

Oh Lord, this body, ravaged by old age, is now beyond my control. How can I even think of external things? (64)

My senses, once sharp and powerful, are now dull and sluggish. My mind has become inert. (65)

I try to move my feet, but they stumble and fall. I see the entire earth as dark and gloomy. (66)

This royal lineage has been passed down through generations. Even in this state, I cannot abandon it. (67)

My body is like a ripe fruit, ready to be consumed by Yama, the devourer of life. (68)

Oh Master, I do not fear death as much as I fear the loss of your service. (69)

Why should I hesitate, with this body in such a state? My life depends on your command. (70)

I was so strong, I considered even the king as insignificant as a blade of grass. (56) 

Page #68:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, you, O Lord, knowing my body to be subject to old age, should not be angry. Be patient and joyful. ||7|| Hearing these words, the king, adorned with earrings, placed his hand on his cheek and pondered. ||72|| This body, like a water bubble, is fleeting. Youth, like the light of twilight, is full of illusions. ||73|| For the sake of this body, which is as swift as lightning, humans undertake many actions, which are ultimately the cause of suffering. ||74|| These pleasures are like the glances of a drunken woman, deceitful, like the fangs of a snake, terrifying, and like fire, they increase suffering. ||75|| The suffering that comes from pursuing these fleeting and difficult-to-obtain objects appears as happiness to the foolish. ||76|| These objects of desire, though initially alluring, are like the fruits of a poisonous tree. It is strange that people desire them. ||77|| Those who are virtuous, enthusiastic, and have attained supreme enlightenment, seeing these objects as poison, engage in austerities. ||78|| When will I abandon these objects, escape from the prison of attachment, and practice the austerities prescribed by the Jinas, which are the cause of liberation? ||79|| The earth has been ruled with ease, the appropriate pleasures have been enjoyed, and valiant sons have been born. What else is there to wait for? ||80|| It is our ancestral tradition that our valiant descendants, renouncing worldly attachments, entrust the kingdom to their sons and enter the forest to practice austerities. ||81|| The king, though he pondered in this way and his attachment to pleasures weakened, still remained attached to his home due to the influence of his past actions. ||82|| For whatever is to be obtained, by whom, where, when, and how much, is obtained at that time, in that place, by that person, and in that way. There is no doubt about it. ||83|| 

Page #69:
---------------------------
The twenty-first chapter is named "Sarvabhutahito" after the Muni Sarvabhutahito, who possessed the knowledge of the mind's subtle workings. While traveling, he arrived in Ayodhya with his large, compassionate Sangha, who were dedicated to the welfare of all beings.  

Like a father caring for his children, he rested his weary Sangha on the banks of the Sarayu River. Some of the Munis, following the instructions of the Acharya, sought solitude in dense forests, some in caves, some in empty houses, some in Jain temples, and some in the hollows of trees, all diligently engaged in their austerities. 

The Acharya, desiring solitude, went to the northwest corner of the city, to a beautiful and spacious garden called Mahendrodya, entering it like an elephant with its herd. This garden, suitable for austerities, was filled with large trees and was inaccessible to animals, women, and eunuchs. It was free from hateful people and devoid of microscopic creatures.  

Underneath a large Nag tree, whose branches spread far and wide, the Acharya sat on a beautiful, vast, pure, and level stone platform. He was radiant like the sun, deep, pleasing to behold, and generous of heart. He had come there to exhaust his karmas through the rainy season. 

Then came the rainy season, a terrifying sight for travelers, with its flashing lightning and the thunderous roar of clouds in all directions. It seemed as if it were scolding the sun, which had been causing suffering to people, and the heavy downpour had driven away the fearsome darkness. 

The earth appeared as if it had donned a fine garment, and the great rivers, carrying their waves, began to rise, eroding the banks. The travelers, experiencing tremors, were filled with confusion.  Despite the torrential rain, the Jain people remained steadfast in their devotion. 

Page #70:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, the sages who walked on earth and those who had attained the power to fly in the sky, all observed numerous vows. Gautama Swami says, "Oh King of Magadha, may these sages protect you." ||98||

Then, as the morning dawned, King Dasharatha, awakened by the sound of the conch shell and the resounding beat of the drums, rose like the sun. ||99||

The roosters, who separate couples, crowed loudly, and the cranes and swans in the lakes and rivers also made their calls. ||100||

Attracted by the melodious sounds of the drums, the panavas, and the veenas, a large crowd gathered at the Jain temples. ||101||

Just as a man, filled with shame, leaves his beloved, so too did the people, whose eyes were spinning and whose entire bodies were flushed red, abandon their sleep. ||102||

The lamps had turned pale, and the moon had lost its brilliance. The lotuses were in bloom, and the night-blooming jasmine had closed. ||103||

Just as the debaters are defeated by the words of a knower of the Jain scriptures, so too were all the planets defeated, that is, hidden, by the rays of the sun. ||104||

Thus, as the extremely pure morning dawned, King Dasharatha performed his bodily duties and worshipped the venerable Jina. Then, mounted on a beautiful elephant adorned with a fine cloth, he set out to pay his respects to the sage. Thousands of kings, radiating with a divine glow, served him. ||105-106||

In this way, King Dasharatha, adorned with an umbrella, went to the Mahendrodya garden, paying homage to the sages and Jain temples along the way. ||107||

Gautama Swami says, "Oh King, the glory of King Dasharatha, which brought joy to the people, cannot be described even in a year." ||108||

The sage, a treasure trove of virtues, had just arrived in the country, and the news reached the king's ears. ||109||

Then, dismounting from his elephant, the king, adorned with infinite splendor and filled with great joy, entered the garden. ||110||

After that, with devotion, he offered a garland of flowers at the sage's feet and bowed his head in reverence to the teacher of all beings. ||111|| 

Page #71:
---------------------------
The thirty-ninth chapter, entitled "Dasaratha's Renunciation and the Arrival of the All-Being Benefactor," from the Padmacharita, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, is as follows:

The king listened to the story related to the principles, the biographies of past and future great souls, the world, substances, epochs, the state of the Kulakaras, various lineages, all beings and other objects, and the Puranas with great reverence. After listening, he bowed to the Lord of the Sangha, the All-Being Benefactor, and entered the city.

Then, giving space to the ministers and kings for a moment, that is, conversing with them, the king, filled with wonder after hearing the story of the qualities of the Jina kings, entered the inner palace. There, the king, adorned with great splendor and the glory of the Lord of beings, performed the rituals of bathing, etc., with great joy.

Then, he stayed in the inner palace, delighting in the company of those women who were endowed with excellent radiance, who possessed faces as beautiful as the moon, who were adorned with captivating glances that captivated both eyes and hearts, who were like Lakshmi, and who were imbued with utmost humility, the lotus-like women, like the sun.

Thus ends the thirty-ninth chapter of the Padmacharita, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, renowned by the name of Arsha, which describes the renunciation of King Dasaratha and the arrival of the All-Being Benefactor.

## The Thirtieth Chapter

Then, time passed by, and King Bhamandala, overwhelmed with grief, saw the sky, clear and bright like a polished sword.  [1]

The lotus, water lily, and other aquatic flowers bloomed, intoxicating the senses, and the water became as pure as the hearts of the saints. [2]

Autumn arrived, its presence marked by the blooming white lotuses, and the rainbow vanished, leaving the earth free of mud. [3]

Clouds, devoid of lightning and as white as cotton, appeared here and there, like fragments of a larger whole. [4]

The night, a new bride, adorned with the crimson glow of twilight on her lips, wore the moon's light as her radiant garment, and the moon itself as her crown. [5]

The ponds, adorned with the graceful shadows of the swans and the calls of the intoxicated cranes, were filled with the beauty of roaming geese. [6]

For Bhamandala, consumed by thoughts of Sita, even the beauty of autumn felt like a burning fire. [7]

His body consumed by longing, Bhamandala, overcoming his shyness, spoke to his dearest friend, Vasantdhvaj, in front of his father. [8]

"You are slow and deliberate, taking your time with everything. I have spent countless nights in sorrow, my heart consumed by Sita, yet you remain unmoved." [9]

"I am drowning in a sea of hope, filled with turbulent waves of worry. Why, my friend, do you not offer me any support?" [10]

Hearing these words, filled with anguish, the wise men were struck with despair. [11]

Seeing them, consumed by grief and withered like elephants, Bhamandala lowered his head, ashamed, for a moment. [12]

The Thirtieth Chapter

Then Brihatketu, the Vidyadhara, said, "Why is this being concealed? It should be revealed so that the Kumar may be disillusioned." (13)

Then they all told him the story in detail, their words faltering as they spoke of the Chandrayana. (14)

"We brought the girl's father here and earnestly requested her hand, but he said he had already promised her to Rama." (15)

"He defeated us all in a battle of words, and we decided to hold a contest of archery. Whoever could string the Dhanur Ratna would win the girl." (16)

"We set this condition because we thought Rama would not be able to string it, and you would win the girl. But the Dhanur Ratna, like a piece of meat offered to a hungry lion, was easily strung by Rama, who is blessed by virtue. Thus, the virtuous girl became Rama's wife in the Swayamvara." (17)

"She was a captivating woman, her heart-stealing words and youthful beauty filling her form. Her face was like the young moon, she was as beautiful as Lakshmi, and she was filled with love." (18-19)

"Those bows, Sagara Avarta and Vajra Avarta, were not like the bows of today. They were ancient, adorned with weapons like maces and ploughs, and were protected by the gods. Even the Garuda, the serpents, and the demons could not look at them. Yet, Rama and Lakshmana strung them, and Rama won the beautiful girl of the three worlds." (20-21)

"Even the gods could not forcibly take her now, and we, who are powerless without those bows, are even less able." (22)

"If you ask why she was not taken before Rama's Swayamvara, the answer is that Madhu, the king who is Ravana's father-in-law, is Janaka's friend. How could we have taken her while he was alive?" (23)

"Therefore, knowing all this, Kumar, be at peace. You are very virtuous, and even Indra cannot change what is destined to be." (24)

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, upon hearing about the Swayamvara, Bhamandala was filled with shame and sorrow. He was consumed by grief and fell into deep contemplation.  ||25||

"This life as a Vidyadhara is meaningless, for I have not been able to obtain my beloved like a common mortal." ||26||

Filled with jealousy and anger, he laughed and addressed the assembly, "What is the use of being a Vidyadhara when you are afraid even of earth-dwellers? ||27||

I will conquer the earth-dwellers and bring that excellent maiden myself. I will also subdue the Yakshas who have stolen the legacy of the bow." ||28||

Having said this, he boarded his celestial chariot, fully prepared, and ascended into the sky. From there, he looked upon the earth, filled with cities and forests. ||29||

Then, his gaze fell upon the country of Vidagdha, adorned with numerous mountains, and upon the beautiful city of his previous birth. ||30||

"Have I seen this city before?" he wondered, and upon remembering his past life, he fainted. ||31||

His ministers, filled with anxiety, brought him to his father. Women sprinkled his body with sandalwood paste and revived him. ||32||

The women exchanged glances and laughed, saying, "O Prince, your cowardice is unbecoming. ||33||

You are wise, yet you have fallen into delusion without even considering the purpose of your earthly sojourn, in the presence of your teachers." ||34||

"There are many daughters of Vidyadhara kings, who possess even greater radiance than the goddesses. Seek them out. O handsome one, do not bring upon yourself such unnecessary slander." ||35||

Bhamandala, his face drooping with shame and sorrow, replied, "Alas, I am cursed! I have been consumed by intense infatuation and have thought wrongly. ||36||

Even the most lowly of men would not engage in such an act. Oh, how my evil deeds have led me astray!" ||37||

"I have shared the same womb with her. Now, with the fading of my evil deeds, I have somehow recognized her." ||38||

Overwhelmed with grief, Chandragati, filled with immense wonder, took Bhamandala in his arms, kissed him, and asked, "…." ||39||

The Thirtieth Chapter

"Son, why did you say such a thing?"
He said, "Father, listen to my story. In my previous birth, I was a king in this very city, known for his cunning. I was a destroyer of other countries, a warrior with a decorated army. I was famous throughout the land, always eager for war. I was the protector of my people, endowed with great wealth and power. 

In that life, I took the wife of a Brahmin by evil deeds. I deceived him and he went away, deeply distressed. Then, the commander of my army took away all my possessions, leaving me with only my body. Wandering the earth, I became extremely poor and eventually reached the hermitage of the monks. 

There, I received the pure and holy religion of the great Jinas, the worshiped ones of the three worlds, the omniscient, the great souls. I took the vow of non-violence, pure and simple, under the guidance of my teacher, who was like a brother to me. I was of limited strength, so I could not take on more vows. 

Oh, the great power of the Jina's teachings! Even though I was a great sinner, I did not fall into hell. Through the refuge of the Jina's teachings, and through my vows and discipline, my soul entered the womb of the queen of Videha, along with another being. 

The queen of Videha gave birth to a son and a daughter, happily. But just as a vulture snatches a piece of meat, someone took the son away. That person took the child to the sky, higher than the stars. It was the same person whose wife I had taken in my previous life. 

He said, "I will kill him," but then he showed mercy, adorned him with earrings, and gently released him from the sky. At that time, you were in the garden, and you saw him falling from the sky. You caught him in the night and, out of compassion, gave him to your queen. 

By your grace, I grew up in the queen's lap. I became a scholar of the highest order, skilled in all the arts. 

Having said this, he fell silent. The people present were amazed, their heads shaking, uttering sounds of wonder." 

Page #76:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 

Hearing this most wondrous tale, Chandragati, realizing the tree of worldly dharma to be barren and the bondage of existence, 
abandoned the thought of mere existence, firmly resolved to perform his duty, attained supreme enlightenment and a rare state of awakening. 
He relinquished his kingdom to his son, as per the rules, and with great haste, went to the feet of the Muni, Sarvabhutahita, for the welfare of all beings. 

The Lord Sarvabhutahita, renowned throughout the world, with a multitude of rays of virtues, was a bringer of happiness to the worthy beings. 

Bowing down to him, worshipping him, and praising him with devotion, Chandragati, with folded hands raised to his head, said, "O Lord, I am weary of worldly life and desire to receive the Jain initiation from your grace and perform austerities."

"So be it," said the Muni. The drums were sounded, the Bhamandala performed its supreme function with devotion. 
The finest women sang with the accompaniment of flutes, a multitude of musical instruments roared along with cymbals. 
The sound of the crowd, "The glorious son of King Janaka, Jayanta, is victorious," echoed and reverberated. 

The sound, emanating from the garden, was so powerful that it deprived all the people of Ayodhya of their sleep. 
The Jains were overjoyed hearing this auspicious sound, while the people of false beliefs were filled with sorrow. 

Hearing the sound, Sita awoke as if sprinkled with nectar, her whole body trembled, and her left eye twitched. 
She thought, "Who is this Janaka whose son is victorious? This very high sound is heard again and again." 

"King Janaka is the elder brother of Kanaka and my father. My brother was taken away as soon as he was born, could this be him?" 

Page #77:
---------------------------
## The Thirty-Third Chapter

With her mind overflowing with brotherly affection, Sita, with a choked voice, began to weep. ||69||

Then Rama, with his beautiful form, spoke in sweet words, "Vaidehi, why are you grieving with sorrow for your brother?" ||70||

"If he is indeed your brother, we will know tomorrow, there is no doubt. Or if it is someone else, what is the use of grieving, O learned one?" ||71||

"Wise people do not grieve for what has passed, for the dead, for what has been taken, for what has gone out, or for what has been lost." ||72||

"O beloved, grief is for the cowardly and the ignorant. The valiant and the wise never grieve." ||73||

Thus, as the couple conversed, night passed quickly, as if by mercy, and the auspicious sounds of dawn began. ||74||

Then King Dasharatha, after attending to his personal affairs with respect, departed from the city with his sons and wives. ||75||

He was accompanied by hundreds of vassals. He was amazed as he saw the vast army of celestial beings spread out everywhere. ||76||

He saw a place, built by the celestial beings, equal to the city of Indra, with high ramparts and towers, in a moment. ||77||

It was adorned with flags and arches, and decorated with jewels. He entered that garden, filled with virtuous people. ||78||

There, he bowed and praised his Guru, the best of the virtuous, and witnessed the initiation ceremony of the celestial chariot, named Chandragatika, at sunrise. ||79||

He performed a grand worship of the Guru along with the celestial beings. Then, he sat on one side, surrounded by all his relatives. ||80||

The celestial beings, along with the celestial sphere, also sat on one side, carrying a little grief. ||81||

The celestial beings, the earth-dwellers, and the sages, all sat together, listening to the Guru's discourse on the Dharma of the ascetics and the householders. ||82||

The Guru said, "The Dharma of the ascetics is the Dharma of the valiant, it is extremely peaceful, it is auspicious, it is extremely...

Padmapurana
The auspicious souls, having attained the state of non-doubt, attain great happiness in the presence of the Lord of the Gīrvanas. || 84 || Some, having attained only the illumination of the worlds, ascend to the forefront of the world and enjoy the bliss of liberation. || 85 || This world, filled with the flames of suffering of the animal and hell realms, is freed by that path, which is the most excellent. || 86 || The Muni, who was the well-wisher of all beings, spoke with a voice like a deep roar, filling the minds of all with joy, knowing everything. || 87 || The water of his words, which destroyed the fire of doubt, was drunk by all beings with joyful minds, with their cupped hands held to their ears. || 88 || Then, when there was a pause in the words, King Dasaratha asked, "O Lord, what was the cause of the dispassion of Chandragati, the king of the Vidhyadharas?" || 89 || Sita, who was sitting there with pure eyes, wished to know about her brother, and with a desire to serve, she made her mind completely steady. || 90 || The Lord, with a pure soul, said, "Hear, O King, the strangeness. This is the creation of the souls, by their own earned karmas." || 91 || Having wandered in the world for a long time, this soul of the Bhamandala became very distressed. Driven by the wind of karma, he attained Chandragati, the luminary of the sky. || 92 || He was entrusted to his wife Pushpavati for nurturing. When he became young and attained the anxieties of women, he saw the picture of his sister Sita and was filled with deep sorrow. || 93 || For the purpose of Sita's marriage, King Janaka was abducted by a magical horse. Finally, Sita's bow-ceremony took place, and she chose Rama, the son of King Dasaratha, as her husband. This event caused the Bhamandala to experience supreme anxiety. || 94 || Suddenly, he remembered his previous birth, and fainted. When he regained consciousness, King Chandragati asked him the reason, and he began to tell the story of his previous birth. || 95 || "I was adorned with earrings in the city of Vidagdha, in the land of Bharata. I was unrighteous and took the beloved of Pingala, who was dear to his heart." || 96 ||

---------------------------
The thirty-third chapter:  Baleendu, having lost all his possessions, was expelled from the kingdom. He reached the hermitage of the Shramanas and took the vow of non-violence. ||17||  He spent his time in righteous meditation, free from impurities. He died and was reborn in the womb of Videha, the queen of Janaka. ||28||  Pingala returned from the forest and saw his empty hut. He was consumed by the pain of the fire of his burnt body. ||19||  He was like a madman, his eyes constantly shedding tears like the rain of a bad day. He asked everyone he saw, "Have you seen my lotus-eyed beloved?" ||10||  He cried out, "Oh, my beloved!" and lamented, "You left your mother Prabhavati, your father Chakradhvaja, your great wealth, and your loving brothers, and came to a foreign land for my sake." ||101-102||  "You endured rough food, coarse clothing, and all this for me.  Oh, beautiful one, where have you gone, leaving me behind?" ||103||  Grief-stricken and burnt by the fire of separation, Pingala wandered the earth, filled with sorrow, through mountains and forests. He finally took up austerities, but even then, he was tormented by thoughts of his beloved. ||104||  After attaining the state of a god, he began to worry, "Did my beloved, devoid of right faith, take birth in the womb of a lower animal?" ||105||  "Or, being naturally pure, did she become human again? Or, remembering the Jina at the end of her life, did she attain the state of a god?" ||106||  Thinking this way, he became resolute and fixed his gaze. Filled with anger, he thought, "Where is that wicked enemy who abducted her?" After some thought, he realized that the enemy was also present in the womb of Queen Videha, along with his beloved. ||107||  Queen Videha gave birth to a son and a daughter. To avenge his hatred, he...

In the night when the moon was laughing, you caught the falling child. Do you not remember that you gave him to your queen Pushpavati? ||109||
I have attained the status of a Vidyadhara by your grace. Indeed, Videha is my mother and Sita is my sister. ||110||
Hearing this, the entire assembly of Vidyadharas was filled with wonder. Chandrayana, frightened by the world, left his kingdom and entrusted it to Bhamandala, saying, "O son! Your parents are in sorrow due to grief, so bring joy to their eyes." ||111-112||
Then, thinking, "Death is inevitable for the born, and after death, one returns to the womb," Chandrayana, frightened by the world, attained renunciation. ||113||
Meanwhile, Bhamandala asked the sage Sarvabhutihita, "O Lord! Why did Chandrayana and others have such great affection for me?" ||114||
In reply, the sage said, "O Bhamandala! I will tell you how your parents were in a previous birth." ||115||
In Darugrama, there was a Brahmin named Vimuchi. His wife's name was Anukosha, and his son's name was Atibhuti. Atibhuti's wife's name was Sarasa. ||116||
Once, a Brahmin named Kayana came to his house with his mother, Urya. He stole Sarasa, Atibhuti's wife, and the wealth inside the house, meaning he took Sarasa and the wealth and ran away. ||117||
Because of this, Atibhuti was very sad and wandered the earth searching for his wife. Meanwhile, his house became devoid of men, and the remaining wealth was also stolen. ||118||
Vimuchi, desiring a reward, had already gone to another country. When he heard that his family home had been destroyed, he returned quickly. ||119||
He saw that his wife Anukosha was very distraught and her body was covered in tattered rags. He comforted her and went with her to search for his son, along with Urya, Kayana's mother. ||120||
He heard it being said everywhere on the surface of the earth, and it was revealed to him by the knowledge of the past. ||121||
The god took the child, but the consequences of his karma were pacified, so he made the child small with the power of the Laguparni Vidya and said, "Live," and released him from the sky. ||108||

---------------------------
The thirtieth festival, the Tamācārya, had arrived in the city of Sarvāri.  The son, filled with great sorrow and his mind shattered, was eager to ask about his son.  ||122|| Seeing the prosperity of the Gaṇeśvarī and hearing about the various states of existence, he was filled with intense emotion and went to the Muni for liberation. ||123|| Pārve, Kamalakāntā, the Āryikā, was well-established in her vows and was steadfast in her austerities, along with Anukośā. ||124|| All three of them, with great detachment, having spent their time in meditation, went to the Lokāntika realm, the eternal world, free from anxiety. ||125|| Atibhūti and the others, who were proponents of the doctrine of violence, and who hated the restrained, went to a bad state due to their wrong meditation. ||126|| Sarasa, the wife of Atibhūti, became a deer in the foothills of the mountain called Valāhaka.  Frightened by a tiger, she was separated from the herd and perished in a forest fire. ||127|| Then, due to the pacification of the evil karma, which was skilled in giving pain, Cittoutsavā, the daughter of Manasvinī Devī, was born. ||128|| Kayāna, in turn, became a horse, then a camel.  After death, he became Piṅgala, the son of Dhūmakeśa. ||129|| Atibhūti, wandering through the cycle of births, became a swan on the banks of the lake called Tārākṣa.  At some point, falcons tore his entire body apart, and he fell near the Jain temple, wounded. ||130|| There, the disciple named Yaśomitra was repeatedly reciting the praise of the Arhant Bhagavān.  Hearing this, the swan breathed his last. ||131|| As a result, he became a Kinnara deva on the mountain called Nagottara, with a lifespan of ten thousand years.  He was expelled from there and became the king, Kuṇḍalamandita, in the city of Vidagdha. ||132|| Due to the karmic imprints of his past life, Piṅgala abducted the daughter of Cittoutsavā, and Kuṇḍalamandita, the king, abducted her from him.  The connection of their past lives has been mentioned before. ||133|| The Brahman, who was Vimuchi, became the king, Candragati.  His wife, Anukośā, was reborn as Puṣpavatī. ||134|| Kayāna became a deva who abducted, Sarasa became Cittoutsavā, Ūrī became Videhā, and Atibhūti became Bhāmaṇḍala. ||135||

In the Padma Purana,
Andrat,
Then Dasharatha, having heard the entire account, embraced Bhamandala, his eyes filled with tears. ||136||
His hair stood on end with joy, and the assembly was filled with tears of happiness. ||137||
Seeing his brother with a radiant face, Sita, like a deer, ran towards him, her arms raised, crying, "Oh brother! I see you for the first time today!" She embraced him and wept for a long time, regaining her composure. ||138-139||
Rama, Lakshmana, and other relatives also embraced Bhamandala with joy and spoke to him with respect. ||140||
After paying respects to the great sage, all the celestial beings and earth-dwellers emerged from the garden, filled with joy and adorned with great beauty. ||141||
After consulting with Bhamandala, Dasharatha quickly sent a letter to King Janaka through a celestial being. ||142||
Bhamandala's excellent chariot was coming through the sky, carried by swans and surrounded by many celestial warriors. ||143||
Then, taking Bhamandala with him, Dasharatha, with great glory, entered Ayodhya. ||144||
Dasharatha, the king with inexhaustible wealth, celebrated a great festival with all the people, delighted by the arrival of Bhamandala. ||145||
Bhamandala stayed comfortably in the beautiful, spacious, high palace, adorned with ponds and gardens, as instructed by Dasharatha. ||146||
At that great festival, Dasharatha gave so much in charity that the poor people of the earth were freed from poverty, receiving more than they desired. ||147||
Meanwhile, the celestial messenger, swift as the wind, delivered the news of his son's arrival, instantly delighting King Janaka. ||148||
King Janaka, reading the letter and firmly believing its truth, was filled with immense joy. His whole body trembled with happiness. ||149||
He asked the celestial being, "Oh noble one! Is this a dream? Or is this a real experience? Come, be happy, be happy! I will embrace you today." ||150||

## Chapter Thirty

Having said this, King Janaka, whose eyes were filled with tears of joy, embraced the messenger Vidya-dhara as if he had found his own son.  [151]  With great joy, he danced and gave all the ornaments and clothes he was wearing to the Vidya-dhara, leaving only enough to cover his body and prevent him from being naked. [152]  As King Janaka's friends and relatives gathered, their joy increasing, the celestial chariot of Bhamandala arrived, its radiance illuminating the sky. [153]  King Janaka, unable to contain his excitement, repeatedly asked about Bhamandala, and the Vidya-dhara recounted the entire story in detail. [154]

Then, King Janaka, along with all his relatives, boarded the chariot and in the blink of an eye, reached Ayodhya, which was filled with the sweet sounds of trumpets. [155]  Descending from the sky, he immediately embraced his son tightly.  Overwhelmed with joy, his eyes closed, and he fainted for a moment. [156]  Upon regaining consciousness, he looked at his son with his large, tear-filled eyes, and touched him with his hand, finding immense satisfaction. [157]  Seeing her son, Queen Videha also fainted from joy.  Upon regaining consciousness, she wept so sorrowfully that even animals were moved by her grief. [158]  She lamented, "Oh, my son! Why were you taken away by a cruel enemy as soon as you were born?" [159]  "My body, consumed by the fire of worry about you, has been burning for so long.  Today, it has finally been quenched by the water of your presence." [160]  "Pushpavati is a blessed and fortunate woman, for she held your dusty limbs in her lap when you were a child, kissed your face, anointed with sandalwood and adorned with saffron, and witnessed your childhood, when you were still a young boy." [161-162]  Tears flowed from Queen Videha's eyes, and milk continued to flow from her breasts for a long time.  [163]

Padma Purana
Jrimbhairavat, a devotee of the Arhat, resided in the Airavata region. She gazed upon Bhamandala, immersing herself in the ocean of bliss. ||164||
After spending a month in Ayodhya, Bhamandala, filled with joy from the company of his kin and bearing utmost humility, addressed Rama, saying: ||165||
"O Lord! You are the refuge of Sita, and you are her most excellent friend. May you reside in her heart in such a way that she does not experience any anxiety." ||166||
Bhamandala, possessing a noble heart and adorned with excellent deeds, embraced his sister, filled with affection, and repeatedly instructed her. ||167||
Mother Videha also embraced Sita, saying, "Daughter! You are dear to your in-laws. Conduct yourself with your family in such a way that you earn praise." ||168||
After consulting everyone and entrusting the kingdom of Mithila to Kanaka, Bhamandala, taking his parents with him, departed for his own abode, Bhamandala. ||169||
Indravajra
O King Shrenika of Magadha, behold the greatness of the Dharma performed in the past. Through the power of Dharma, Rama obtained Bhamandala, the king of the Vidyadharas, as his brother, Sita, a wife adorned with virtues and beauty, and a bow, adorned with a shield, plow, mace, and other weapons, which is extremely rare even for the gods. He also obtained Lakshmana, a servant who is a treasure trove of Lakshmi. ||170-171||
Upendravajra
Whoever, with a pure heart, listens to this story of Bhamandala's auspicious arrival, that person, possessing a virtuous soul, will attain the company of loved ones and good health for a long time, like the radiant sun. ||172||
Thus ends the thirtieth chapter of the Padma Charita, titled "Bhamandala's Arrival," narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||30||
He attained supreme joy upon receiving the company of his excellent son. ||163|| 

Page #85:
---------------------------
Chapter Thirty-One

King Shrenik, accompanied by his ministers, asked the sage, "O गणनायक (Gananaayak), what did King Dasharatha, the son of Anaranya, do after attaining this glory?"

"O great one, you know the ancient story of Rama and Lakshmana. Please tell me all about it."

The great and radiant sage, addressed as the leader of the monks, replied, "O King, I will tell you the story as it was told by the omniscient one."

He said, "Once, King Dasharatha, filled with doubt, bowed to the benevolent sage, Sarvabhuta-hita, who was a well-wisher of all beings, and asked him, "O Master, I have taken many births, but I do not remember even one of them. You know everything. Please tell me about them."

"O Lord, I wish to know them. Please tell me. I worship you to remove my ignorance by your grace."

Hearing this, the benevolent sage, Sarvabhuta-hita, who was ready to listen, said to King Dasharatha, "Listen, O King, I will tell you what you ask. I will explain how you attained true knowledge after wandering through this world."

"O King, you are not the only one who has wandered through this world of suffering. Many others have also wandered through it, accumulating karma and generating suffering."

"O King, in this threefold world, there are three destinies for beings who seek their own good: the lowest, the middle, and the highest."

"The lowest destiny is that of the अभव्य (Abhavyi), the middle is that of the भव्य (Bhavyi), and the highest is that of the सिद्ध (Siddh). The Jinas have described the सिद्धगति (Siddhgati) as free from rebirth and leading to liberation."

"This सिद्धगति (Siddhgati) is pure and brings eternal happiness. It is not seen by the blind, who are deluded by the wounds and diseases of the senses." 

Page #86:
---------------------------
The Padma Purana states that those who lack faith and are not free from the five sins, including violence, are destined to wander through the four realms of existence. Their path is characterized by intense darkness and passion.  

The path of the unworthy is filled with suffering and devoid of liberation, while the path of the worthy leads to liberation. The unworthy perpetually cycle through the four realms, while some of the worthy attain liberation.

All that encompasses the realms of existence, from the material elements of dharma and adharma to the boundless expanse of space, is called "loka." All beings in the universe are embodied, dwelling in the six types of bodies, starting with the earth element.

This vast multitude of living beings is infinite and never ceases to exist. Just as there is no end to grains of sand, the expanse of the sky, or the rays of the moon and sun, so too is the multitude of living beings endless.

The three realms of existence, encompassing both mobile and immobile beings, are eternal and without beginning. They are filled with the accumulation of individual karma and are constantly traversed by beings in various forms.

All those who have attained liberation, those who are currently attaining it, and those who will attain it in the infinite future, have done so through the path revealed by the Jinas. There is no other way.

How can one who is stained by the blemish of doubt, burdened by sinful actions, and devoid of the essence of dharma, attain true vision?

How can one who lacks faith attain dharma and its fruits? Those whose souls are devoid of true vision, who are enveloped in the harsh armor of karma, who are attached to false dharma, and who are far from their own well-being, are destined to experience the intense suffering of ignorance.

In the city of Hastinapur, there lived a householder named Upasti. His wife was named Dipini. She was filled with false pride, devoid of faith, and carried the poison of anger and envy. She was consumed by evil thoughts, and her words were always ready to condemn the virtuous. She never offered food to anyone herself, nor did she approve of others offering it. She diligently prevented even the smallest act of kindness. 

Those who are afflicted by suffering and blinded by delusion cannot see this. 

Page #87:
---------------------------
The thirty-first chapter, and so on, [describes] the great sins [committed by] the woman who was filled with the feeling of disrespect for the Tirthankaras. She wandered in the terrible and endless ocean of the world, deluded by time. ||25||

In contrast, Upasti, practicing the two syllables "Dehi Dehi" (Give, Give), gave generously and, due to the influence of her virtuous deeds, was born in the city of Andrakapura, as the wife of Madra, a householder. Their son, Dharana, was fortunate and had many brothers. His wife was named Nayanasundari. ||26-27||

She offered pure food to the virtuous ones who came to her at the right time and place. As a result, she attained liberation, renounced her body in a state of Samadhi, and was born in the Kurukshetra region of the Videha realm, north of Mount Meru. There, she enjoyed pleasures for three Palyas and was born in heaven. ||28-29||

From there, she fell and was born as the son of King Nandighosa and Queen Vasudha, named Nandivardhana, in the city of Pushkalavati. ||30||

One day, King Nandighosa, having heard the excellent Dharma, became enlightened. He entrusted the responsibility of ruling the earth to Nandivardhana and, taking initiation from the sage Yashodhara, engaged in great austerities. Finally, he renounced his body according to the proper procedure and was born in heaven. ||31-32||

Meanwhile, Nandivardhana, devoted to the duties of a householder and the practice of the five-fold prostration mantra, enjoyed great pleasures for a hundred million years. Then, renouncing his body through Sannyasa, he went to the fifth heaven. From there, he fell and was born as the son of King Ratnamali and Queen Vidyullata, named Suryajaya, in the city of Sashipura, located on Mount Vijaya, west of Mount Sumeru, in the Videha realm. ||33-35||

Later, the mighty King Ratnamali set out to wage war against King Vajralochana, who resided in the city of Simhapura. ||36||

He was accompanied by brilliant chariots, foot soldiers, elephants, horses, and numerous warriors who created darkness with their weapons. ||37|| 

Page #88:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that the one with bitten lips, holding a bow, whose body was covered with armor, who desired to burn the enemy's place with the fire-weapon, who was riding on the front of the chariot, who was swift and had a terrifying form, was seen in the sky by a celestial being who exclaimed: "O Ratnamalin! What have you begun? Abandon your anger and remember, I will tell you your past story."

"In the land of Bharata, there was a city called Gandhari, ruled by a king named Bhuti. Upamanyu was his priest. Both the king and the priest were meat-eaters and engaged in harmful deeds."

"Once, hearing the discourse of the sage Kamalgarbha, King Bhuti took a vow, saying, 'I will never again engage in such sinful acts.' "

"Due to the effect of this vow, he accumulated so much merit that it could have secured him five palya of lifespan in heaven. However, due to the advice of Upamanyu, his priest, all this merit was lost, as if it had turned to ashes. He abandoned that virtuous state. At that time, enemies attacked and killed him along with his priest."

"The priest's soul was reborn as an elephant, which was wounded in battle. He obtained the five prostrations mantra, which was rare for others to obtain. In the same Gandhari, a son named Arisudan was born to the wise son of King Bhuti, to a woman named Yojanagandha."

"Seeing the sage Kamalgarbha, Arisudan remembered his past life. He became detached and took initiation. After death, he became a celestial being in the eleventh heaven called Shatara. Thus, I am the soul of that priest, and you are the soul of King Bhuti, who was reborn as a deer in the forest called Mandaranya. There, he was burned in a fire and became an Akamanirjara. As a result, he became a low-born man named Klij. In that existence, you performed terrible deeds, committed grave sins, and as a result, you went to the hell called Sharkaraprabha."

"After that, I went there and awakened you with the power of affection. As a result, you were born as this Rakhamali, the king of birds."

"Have they not attained sorrow?" Thus, having said this, the Devaka, the son of Surya, placed his son, the Kula-nandana, on the throne.  ||51||  Hearing this account, Surya-jaya, along with his father, the king Ratna-mali, with a mind set on virtuous deeds, attained supreme dispassion. ||52||  Ratna-mali, his mind terrified by various calamities, went for refuge to the serene Acharya, Tilaka-sundara. ||53||  Surya-jaya, having performed austerities, attained the great Shukra (heaven).  He was born as Dasharatha, the son of the sage Anaranya. ||54||  With a little merit, you have attained growth like the seed of the banyan tree, through auspicious beginnings, with your worship of the Bhavas. ||55||  You, King Dasharatha, are the upastika jiva, and in the cycle of Nandi-vardhana, your father, Nandi-ghosha, having performed austerities, went to the Greveya-ka, and from there, having fallen, I became Sarva-bhuta-hita. ||56||  Those who were the jivas of Bhuti and Upamanyu, following their own inclinations, became King Janaka and Kanaka, respectively, due to the influence of their merit. ||57||  In this world, there is no one who is truly a stranger, nor is there anyone who is truly one's own.  This is the transformation of birth and death of the jiva, due to auspicious and inauspicious actions. ||58||  Hearing this account of the past lives, the son of Anaranya, King Dasharatha, became enlightened, and with a humble heart, free from doubt, he turned towards self-control. ||59||  With all due respect, he worshipped the feet of his Guru, bowed down to him, and with a pure heart, entered the city. ||60||  Thus, in his mind, he thought, "I will give this position of the Lord of the Great Mandala to the wise Rama, and I will embrace the life of a Muni." ||61||  Rama, the righteous and steadfast, is capable of protecting this earth, the Bharat Kshetra, which is surrounded by three oceans, along with his brothers. ||62||  Thus, King Dasharatha, who was detached from the allure of the kingdom and had his mind set on liberation, was thinking in this way, when the autumn season, whose garment was pure moonlight, whose face was the moon, and whose eyes were lotuses, disappeared as if frightened by the snow. ||63-64||  And the winter, with its cold winds, had made the lotuses devoid of their radiance, and had disturbed the entire world. ||65||

Ratna-mali became a Vidya-dhara. ||50||

The Padma Purana describes those with cracked lips and feet, wearing old rags on their backs, whose teeth make a sound like a veena, and whose hair is rough and unkempt. Their thighs and laps are stained like the feathers of a partridge, constantly scorched by fire. Their minds are consumed by the worry of filling their stomachs, and their bodies are as dark as the skin of a ripe, unripe fruit. Their hearts are broken by the sharp words of their wicked wives. They are constantly engaged in bringing wood and other materials, scorched by the sun all day long, carrying axes and other weapons on their shoulders, their backs hardened by carrying heavy loads. They fill their stomachs with vegetables, sour fruits, and other such things, and they endure great hardship in their dilapidated huts during the harsh winter. 

In contrast, those who are free from worry due to their inexhaustible wealth live in magnificent palaces. Their bodies are covered in fine garments that ward off the cold and are fragrant with the scent of sandalwood. They enjoy delicious food, seasoned with six flavors, served in vessels of gold and silver, and they eat with a carefree spirit. Their bodies are smeared with saffron and perfumed with incense made from black aloe wood. Their eyes gaze out from windows, and they find endless joy in music, dance, and other forms of entertainment. They are adorned with garlands and ornaments, and they delight in witty conversation. These men, along with their virtuous, skilled, and beautiful wives, engage in playful activities, all thanks to the blessings of their good deeds. 

The Acharya says that happiness is attained through virtue, and suffering through sin. All beings experience the fruits of their actions. 

At that time, King Dasharatha, filled with fear of the cycle of birth and death, yearned for the embrace of liberation and renounced all worldly pleasures. He immediately ordered the gatekeeper to summon his ministers and vassals, saying, "O Bhadra, bring my vassals, along with the ministers." The gatekeeper, standing at the gate, instructed another man, who was like himself, to carry out the order.

The thirty-first chapter. The king, having been told what to do by the Lord, said, "I have decided to renounce the world." ||80|| Then the ministers and the kings, who were considered worthy, said, "O Lord, what is the reason for this change of mind in you now?" ||81|| He said in front of them, "This whole world is burning like dry grass in the fire of death." ||82|| What is not acceptable to the unworthy is acceptable to the worthy. It is worshipped by gods and demons, it is praiseworthy, it gives happiness and liberation. ||83|| It is manifest in the three worlds, subtle, pure, and without comparison. I have heard this Jain scripture from the munis, and I have heard it again today. ||84|| It is the supreme, the most pure, the perfect knowledge for all beings. By the grace of the guru's feet, I have attained the path of liberation. ||85|| I have seen the great whirlpools of countless births, filled with the mud of delusion, full of crocodiles of false reasoning, filled with waves of great suffering, accompanied by the waves of death, filled with the water of false belief, with the terrible sound of weeping, flowing with the speed of false religion, and going towards the ocean of hell. Remembering this river of the world, my limbs tremble with fear on all sides. ||86-88|| You are deluded, do not say anything, do not stop me. How can darkness dwell in a place where the sun is present? ||89|| Quickly anoint my first son as king, so that I can enter the forest of penance without hindrance. ||90|| Hearing this, the ministers and the chieftains, knowing the king's firm resolve, were filled with great sorrow. Their heads bowed low. ||91|| They dug the ground with their fingers, their eyes filled with tears, and they became lifeless in an instant, sitting in silence. ||92|| Hearing that the Lord of life has decided to take the vow of non-attachment, the entire palace was filled with pure joy.

Having released the amusements presented in the Padma Purana, the women with tear-filled eyes, making a great sound of their ornaments, wept. ||9|| Seeing his father in such a state, Bharata became aware. He thought, "Alas! This bond of affection is very painful and difficult to break." ||15|| "What is the purpose of this worry for my father, who has attained right knowledge? Why should he be concerned about the kingdom when he desires to take the vows of renunciation?" ||16|| "I do not need to ask anyone, I will quickly go to the forest of penance, the cause of the destruction of this world full of great sorrow." ||97|| "What is the use of this perishable body, this house of disease? And what is the use of relatives who are enjoying the fruits of their own actions?" ||98|| "This creature, blinded by delusion, wanders alone in this forest of sorrow, filled with the trees of birth." ||99|| Then, knowing the art of the arts, Kekayi, having learned of Bharata's intention, began to grieve greatly. ||100|| "How can my husband and my son, the abode of virtues, not be mine? What definite means can I employ to keep them both?" ||101|| Thus, afflicted with worry and with a very troubled mind, the thought of asking for a boon quickly came to Kekayi's mind. ||102|| With great joy, she went to King Dasharatha, who was firm in his resolve, and sitting on a half-seat, with great radiance, she spoke: "O Lord! You, in your grace, had said in the presence of all the kings and queens, 'Whatever you desire, I will give it to you.' So, O Lord! Grant me that boon now. Your glory, radiant with truth and pure, is spreading throughout the world due to the power of your giving." ||103-105|| Then King Dasharatha said, "O beloved! Tell me your desire. O beloved, who possesses excellent intentions! Ask for whatever you desire. I will give it to you now." ||106|| 
The entire inner palace gathered together, having been overcome by great sorrow. ||93|| 

Page #93:
---------------------------
The thirty-first chapter, thus said, the one who knew her resolve, Kekayi, shed tears and said, "O Lord! Why have you made your heart so cruel? Tell me, what wrong have we done that you are eager to abandon us? O King! You know that our life is dependent on you."

"The initiation ordained by the Jina is extremely difficult. Why have you made up your mind to embrace it today?"

"O Lord of life! Your body, nurtured by pleasures like those of Indra, how will it embrace the various austerities of a mendicant?"

Hearing Kekayi speak thus, King Dasharatha said, "My dear, what is a burden for the capable? Just tell me your desire! Whatever I have to do, I will surely achieve it now."

Hearing her husband speak thus, Kekayi, the queen, digging the earth with her finger, bowed her head and said, "O Lord! Grant the kingdom to my son."

Then Dasharatha said, "My dear, what is there to be ashamed of? You had entrusted your boon to me, so now let it be as you wish. Give up your sorrow, you have freed me from debt today. Have I ever done anything contrary to your wishes?"

At that time, he called Rama, who was endowed with excellent qualities, and bowing to him, said with a slightly troubled mind, "My dear son! In the past, in a fierce battle, this clever Kekayi, who is skilled in all arts, served me well as a charioteer."

"At that time, being pleased, I promised in front of the queens and the kings, 'Whatever she desires, I will grant it.' But at that time, she had kept that boon with me as a deposit."

"Now, this brilliant woman, who does not depend on anyone, is asking for that boon with a specific intention, saying, 'Give the kingdom to my son.'"

"If I do not grant her wish now, having promised then, Bharata, freed from the attachment to the world, will take initiation."

"And this one, out of grief for her son, will give up her life, and my false fame, born of a false act, will spread in this world."

Padma Purana
There is no such rule that a younger son should be given the pleasure of a wife, the wealth of the kingdom, while the elder son is capable and deserving. ||12||
When the entire kingdom is given to Bharata, where will you go with Lakshmana, who possesses the supreme power of a Kshatriya? I do not know. You are a wise and learned man. Therefore, tell me what should I do, who is caught in the midst of this painful and heavy anxiety? ||122-123||
Then, Rama, whose mind was filled with good intentions and joy, and whose gaze was fixed on his feet, spoke to his father with great humility. "Father, protect your vow of truth and stop worrying about me. What use is Indra's Lakshmi to me if I lose your respect?" ||124-125||
A son who is born and desires to stay at home should do what will not cause his parents even a little sorrow. ||126||
Wise men say that a son's true nature is to purify his father or protect him from sorrow. ||127||
While this story, which captivated the assembly, was being told, Bharata, with a firm resolve to destroy the world, descended from the palace. Seeing this, the people cried out in alarm. His father, with a heart filled with love and sorrow, stopped him. Bharata, obedient to his father, wanted to stop and stand before him on the ground; but his father took him in his arms, embraced him, kissed him, and said, "My son, you rule the kingdom. I am going to the forest to do penance." ||128-129||
In response, Bharata said, "I will not serve the kingdom, I am taking initiation." ||130-131||
Hearing this, his father said, "My son, you are still young and handsome, so enjoy the pleasures of human life. You can take initiation later when you are old." ||132||
To this, Bharata replied, "Father, why are you deceiving me? Death does not wait for a child or a young man." ||133||
His father then said, "My son, even in the household life, one can accumulate virtue. 1. Pīḍitam ma. 2. Sadbhāvaḥ prīti -ba. 3. Bhavanti hanmīti ma. (?) 4. sthātumicchuh.

## Thirty-First Chapter

77. "Having said this, Bharata addressed his father, 'O father, what is the liberation of a householder who is filled with lust, anger, etc.?'"

135. "The father replied, 'O son, liberation is attained by a few Munis in one birth. Most Munis do not attain liberation. Therefore, practice Dharma while living in the household.'"

136. "Bharata said, 'O father, even if this is so, what is the purpose of the household life? It is certain that liberation cannot be attained through it.'"

137. "Furthermore, my liberation will not be gradual. I will attain it in this very birth. Gradual liberation is suitable for others. Is Garuda similar to other birds in speed?'"

138. "Low-minded people, consumed by the fire of lust, engage in actions related to the tongue and touch, but they do not find satisfaction."

139. "Just as ghee is poured into the fire of lust, it increases greatly and produces heat."

140. "Having enjoyed these fleeting pleasures, which are difficult to obtain and even more difficult to protect, one inevitably goes to hell, which is full of suffering due to sin."

141. "O father, I am deeply afraid of the world. Please grant me permission so that I can go to the forest and perform austerities, which are the cause of liberation, according to the scriptures."

142. "O father, if liberation can be attained even in the household, why are you abandoning it? You are a wise man."

143. "Wise people say that it is the duty of a father to protect his son from suffering and to approve of his austerities."

144. "This being leaves behind his lifespan, wife, beloved ones, father, mother, wealth, and brother, and departs alone."

145. "One who is not satisfied even after enjoying the pleasures of the gods for a long time, how can he be satisfied with the insignificant pleasures of the human world?"

146. "Hearing these words of Bharata, King Dasharatha was moved and his body trembled with joy. He said, 'O son, you are blessed and wise, a true Kshatriya.'"

---------------------------
In the Papuraana, however, my love for you has never wavered, even in times of hardship. You are indeed the best among the humble, residing in the hearts of all. ||148|| Listen, my dear, I was once in a life-threatening situation during a battle. Your mother, acting as my charioteer, protected me. Filled with gratitude, I vowed to the assembled kings, "I will grant her whatever she desires." ||149|| This was an old debt I owed her, and today she has come to claim it. With great respect, she has asked for the kingdom for my son. ||150|| Therefore, my son, rule this kingdom, free from any obstacles, like Indra himself. Let not my reputation be tarnished by a false promise, spreading throughout the world. ||151|| Your mother, whose body has been nurtured with comfort, will be consumed by grief and leave this world. ||152|| The wise say that the true nature of a child is to prevent their parents from drowning in the ocean of sorrow. ||153|| Then, with loving eyes and a gentle voice, Rama took her hand and said, "Brother, what my father has said, who else can say? It is true, for the gems of the ocean cannot be born in a pond." ||154-155|| You are not yet ready for the path of asceticism. Therefore, rule the kingdom, so that your father's reputation, pure as the moon, may shine brightly. ||156|| It would be wrong for your mother, whose body is consumed by sorrow, to leave this world while you, a fortunate soul, are still alive. ||157|| We can even give up our bodies to protect our father's truth. Why then, O wise one, are you not accepting prosperity? ||158|| I will dwell by a river, on a mountain, or in a forest, where no one will know me. Rule the kingdom as you please. ||159|| I, the abode of virtues, will abandon all my possessions and embrace the path of renunciation. I will not cause you any pain in this world. ||160|| Do not take long, hot breaths, release yourself from the fear of the world, and fulfill your father's words. Protect the land with justice. ||161||

Thirty-first Chapter

The lineage of the Ikshvaku's, resplendent with the brilliance of Srimad Bhashya, is as vast as the moon's family of planets. ||16||  He who shines, protecting the words of his father, is truly a brother. ||163||  Saying this, Rama, with devotion, bowed his head to the ground, touching his father's feet. Then, accompanied by Lakshmana, he departed from his father's side. ||164||  Meanwhile, the king, though he had fainted, was not noticed by anyone. He stood like a statue, his body stiff and his form like a doll. ||165||  Rama, quickly taking up his bow, went to his mother and, bowing, asked her, "I am going to another earth, another land." ||166||  Hearing Rama's words, his mother fainted, as if suppressing her grief, she played the role of a friend. Then, after a moment, regaining consciousness and with tearful eyes, Aparajita (Kaushalya) said, "Alas, my son! Where are you going? Why are you leaving me, O son of noble deeds, casting me into the ocean of sorrow?" ||167-168||  "My son, you are very rare, I have obtained you after countless desires. Just as one finds support in a branch, so a son is the support of his mother." ||169||  Thus, lamenting with a heart pierced by sorrow, Rama, devoted to his mother, bowed and said, "Mother, do not grieve. I will go to the south and find a suitable place for you. There is no doubt about it." ||170-171||  "The news that your father has given the earth to Bharata as a boon to Kaikeyi, has surely reached your ears." ||172||  "Now, at the end of this earth, in some great forest, on the Vindhyas, on the Malaya mountain, or near the sea, in some other land, Mother, I will make a place for you." ||173||  "As long as I remain near this land, like the sun, the authority of Bharata, like the moon, will not be fulfilled." ||174||  Then, the mother, who was deeply grieved and whose eyes were filled with love, embraced her son. 1. Kaushalya, the mother of Rama. 2. "Karnasya moolam iti karnasya aham."

Padma Purana
"My son, it is right for me to go with you. How can I bear to live without seeing you?" (176)
"Father, husband, or son, these are the three supports of a virtuous woman. My father has completed his time, and my husband is eager to take initiation. Thus, you are the only support of my life now. If you too leave me, tell me, what fate will I meet?" (177-178)
Hearing this, Rama said, "Mother, the earth is very hard with stones. How can you walk on this uneven earth with your feet?" (179)
"Therefore, I will go alone now and find a comfortable place. Then, I will bring you there by some means. So, why do you say you will leave me?" (180)
"Mother, I touch your feet and say that I will surely come to take you. Leave me now, O wise mother!" (181)
Hearing this, Rama's mother left him and comforted him with many auspicious words. Rama, having reached his father, who had attained enlightenment, prostrated before him. (182)
He greeted all the other mothers except Aparajita, consoled them with many sweet words, embraced his brothers and had sweet conversations with them. Then, Rama, whose noble heart was free from sorrow and who was skilled in all kinds of justice, reached Sita's palace, his heart filled with love. (183-184)
Rama said, "My dear, you stay here. I will go to another city." Then, the virtuous woman replied, "Wherever you are, I will be there too." (185)
After this, Rama respectfully inquired of all the ministers, kings, and other members of the family. He spoke with great eagerness to the wise men of the city. (186)
At this time, many friends, filled with affection, gathered around him, embracing him repeatedly, full of respect, and their eyes filled with tears. Rama repeatedly asked them to return. (187)
Then, with gentle eyes, he looked at the chief ministers and the protectors of the people. With a calm and steady mind, he left his father's house. (188) 

Page #99:
---------------------------
The thirty-first chapter:

The chieftains quickly brought beautiful horses and elephants. But Rama, the knower of ultimate justice, did not accept them. ||189||

Seeing her husband ready to depart for a foreign land, Sita, adorned with beautiful garments and with eyes like blooming lotuses, bowed to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, inquired after her friends, and followed her husband, like Indrani following Indra. ||190-191||

Seeing his brother about to depart, Lakshmana, whose heart was filled with affection, thought with anger burning in his eyes: "How can father desire such injustice?  Shame on this feminine nature, always clinging to self-interest and expecting nothing from others!" ||192-193||

"Oh, my elder brother Rama is a great soul, the best among men. Such a rare heart is found even in a sage only occasionally." ||194||

"Should I create another world today, abandoning these wicked people? Or should I forcibly turn Lakshmi away from Bharata?" ||195||

"Today I destroy the powerful strength of the Creator and fall at the feet of my elder brother, making him eager for Lakshmi." ||196||

"Or perhaps it is not right for me to think like this, being overcome by anger, for anger blinds even a sage who has taken initiation." ||197||

"What is the purpose of this inappropriate thought of mine? For my elder brother Rama and father know very well what is right and what is wrong." ||198||

"We should only bring forth the bright fame of our father. Therefore, I will silently follow my elder brother, the doer of good deeds." ||199||

Thus, Lakshmana, calming his own anger, took up his bow, bowed to his father and all the others, and followed Rama. At that time, Lakshmana was endowed with great humility, his appearance was fit for the journey, and his chest was the abode of Lakshmi. ||200-201||

His parents, along with their family and two sons, followed behind, shedding tears like a downpour. ||202||

Rama, with Sita by his side, looked with affection at the chief horses and elephants, and left his father's house. ||188|| 

Page #100:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, the two brothers, Santvanasuri, were endowed with firm conviction and were highly skilled in offering solace. Therefore, they repeatedly prostrated themselves before their parents and persuaded them with great difficulty to return. ||203|| They brought back their brothers many times, yet they refused to stay. Finally, just as gods emerge from heaven, the two brothers left the royal palace. ||204|| "Oh Mother! What is happening? Whose opinion is this? Whose words have led to this? This city is very unfortunate, or why just the city, the entire earth is unfortunate." ||205|| "We will now accompany them, staying with them will alleviate all sorrow. These two are capable of rescuing us from the depths of the mountain of suffering." ||206|| "Look, how Sita is going? The king has allowed her to go with them. Her brother-in-law will take care of everything." ||207|| "Oh! This beautiful Janaki, adorned with the garment of humility, following her husband, is truly blessed, very fortunate." ||208|| "May our women also have such a fate. She is an example for all virtuous wives." ||209|| "Oh! Look, leaving his mother, whose face is drenched in tears, this Lakshmana is eager to go with his elder brother." ||210|| "Oh! This Lakshmana's love is blessed, his devotion is blessed, his strength is blessed, his forgiveness is blessed, and his humility is blessed." ||211|| "What was Bharata's intention? What did King Dasharatha do? What kind of wisdom has arisen in Rama and Lakshmana?" ||212|| "Time, Karma, God, fate, nature, man, action, or destiny itself can do this. Who else can perform such a strange act?" ||213|| "This is all very inappropriate. Where have the deities of this place gone?" Such words were being uttered by the crowd at that time. ||214||
At that time, all the people were eager to go with Rama and Lakshmana, therefore, all the houses in the city became empty, and all the festivities of the city were lost. ||215|| The grounds of all the doors, which were previously filled with clusters of flowers, were now covered with tears of sorrow. ||216||

The rows of people being driven away were agitated like the waves of the ocean by a great wind. ||217||
Though worshipped with devotion, he was troubled by the constant conversation. The lotus-like one considered it an obstacle at every step. ||218||
As if unable to bear the sight of the unequal, the sun with its weak rays set. ||219||
At the end of the day, the sun abandoned all its rays, just as the first Chakravarti Bharat abandoned all his possessions when he desired liberation. ||220||
Evening, adorned with the crimson of the sky, followed the sun, just as Sita, bearing the greatest love and wearing appropriate garments, followed Rama. ||221||
Then, as if born from Rama's departure, darkness enveloped the world, destroying the knowledge of special things. ||222||
To deceive the people who were eager to follow, the two princes, along with Sita, reached the temple of Arhanath at dusk. ||223||
The abode of the destroyer of the world, the Jina, was always adorned and worshipped. The ground was smeared with sandalwood water, it had three doors, a high torana, and was decorated with mirrors and other auspicious things. The extremely wise Rama and Lakshmana, who were free from the need for others, entered the temple with Sita, performing a circumambulation according to the proper procedure. ||224-225||
The people went up to the second door, but at the third door, the doorkeeper stopped them, just as the misleading karma stops those who desire liberation. ||226||
Rama and Lakshmana, who had eyes like lotuses, placed their bows and armor aside, saw the face of the Jina, and attained supreme joy. ||227||
They saw the one who was seated on a throne of jewels, who was gentle, whose two arms were extended, whose chest was adorned with the Srivatsa mark, and whose every mark was clearly visible. ||228||

Padmapurana
The 18th Tirthankara, whose face was like a full moon, whose eyes were like blooming lotuses, and whose image could not be forgotten, was worshipped with all reverence by Rama and Lakshmana, who were filled with concern for their friends. They remained in that temple throughout the night. ||228-230||
When the mothers, who were devoted to their sons, learned that Rama and Lakshmana were staying at the Tirthankara's temple, they rushed there, their eyes filled with tears. They embraced their sons repeatedly and consulted with them. They could not be satisfied with just seeing their sons, and their minds were restless like a person riding a swing. Finally, they went back to King Dasharatha. ||231-232||
The Acharya says that among all purifications, purification of the mind is the most praiseworthy. A woman embraces her son and her husband, but the results are different in each case. ||233||
After that, the four queens, adorned with qualities, beauty, form, and attire, went to their steadfast husband, who was like Mount Meru, and said, "O Beloved! Save this ship of our family, which is sinking in the ocean of sorrow, and bring back Rama along with Lakshmana." ||234-235||
In response, King Dasharatha said, "This world, which is full of suffering, is not under my control. If my wish were to be fulfilled, I would want all beings to be happy forever." ||236||
"No one is destroyed by birth, old age, and death, which are like diseases. But the state of karma is diverse, so who, being wise, would grieve?" ||237||
"There is no satisfaction in seeing loved ones, nor in worldly pleasures, wealth, or life." ||238||
"When the enjoyment of the senses is not complete and life comes to an end, this being, like a bird leaving one tree for another, leaves one body and takes on another." ||239||
"You are mothers, that is, you have sons, so bring back your virtuous sons. Enjoy the prosperity that comes from having sons without any worry." ||240||
"I have renounced my claim to the kingdom and have turned away from evil deeds. I am now following the path of a sage, fearing the consequences of my actions." ||241||
His arms hung down, his chest adorned with the Srivatsa mark, all his auspicious signs were clearly visible, his face was like a full moon, his eyes were like blooming lotuses, and his image could not be forgotten. Such was the 18th Tirthankara, Jinendra, who was worshipped with all reverence, that is, with mind, speech, and body, by Rama and Lakshmana, who were filled with concern for their friends. They remained in that temple throughout the night. ||228-230||
When the mothers, who were devoted to their sons, learned that Rama and Lakshmana were staying at the Tirthankara's temple, they rushed there, their eyes filled with tears.

Thirty-first Parva
Arya-giti-chanda: Thus, with a firm resolve, King Dasharatha, radiant like the sun, free from all desires and faults, embraced complete detachment. ||24||

"I have renounced all sinful actions and have been overcome by intense fear of the world, therefore I will embrace the vows of a monk." ||241|| Thus, with a firm resolve in his heart, radiant like the sun, and free from all desires and faults, King Dasharatha embraced complete detachment. ||242||

The thirty-second chapter:

"In the windows and pavilions, the lovers were watching and listening to the story.  Rama and Lakshmana walked slowly." (13)

"They left the city by the western gate and followed the path leading south." (14)

"In the early morning, while it was still dark, the vassals, filled with devotion and eager to go with Rama, heard that he had deceived his relatives and set out at great speed.  They reached Rama, who was walking slowly, before dawn." (15-16)

"When they saw Rama and Lakshmana walking together, they were filled with great humility and walked on foot." (17)

"They bowed respectfully and spoke to them in turn.  Meanwhile, a large army arrived to search for them." (18)

"With pure hearts, the vassals praised Sita, saying, 'We have obtained the princes through her grace.'" (19)

"If she had not walked slowly with them, how could we have found these princes, who are swift as the wind?" (20)

"This mother is very virtuous and does us great good.  There is no other woman on earth as holy as she." (21)

"Rama and Lakshmana, the best of men, thought about Sita's journey and walked slowly, covering only a short distance each day." (22)

"They saw various kinds of crops, ponds adorned with lotuses, and trees that touched the sky." (23)

"Just as the Ganges and Yamuna rivers are joined by many swift-flowing streams during the rainy season, so too were Rama and Lakshmana's journey joined by many swift-moving kings." (24)

"In villages, towns, camps, and cities, people honored these noble warriors with food and other provisions." (25)

"The vassals were saddened by the loss of their journey.  When they were certain that Rama and Lakshmana would not return, they left without informing them." (26)

The fear is increasing because of the sound of footsteps. (12)

## Chapter 88 of the Padma Purana

88
Padma Purana
Some of the vassals, overcome by fear, were devoted to devotion. Out of humility, they gave their mental suffering to their feet. ||27||
Then, playfully, Rama and Lakshmana reached the Pariyatra forest, which was filled with the roaring of lions and elephants. ||28||
In that forest, there was a dense darkness like the night of the dark fortnight, caused by large trees. There was a river called Sharvari, on whose banks many Shabaras (Bhil) lived. Rama and Lakshmana reached there. ||29||
Resting on the bank of that river, which was adorned with various sweet fruits, Padma, with his good understanding, turned back many kings. ||30||
But other kings, who had decided to go with Padma, did not return even after great effort. ||31||
Seeing that river, which was beautiful like a large sapphire, whose middle part was filled with a group of very fast waves, which was filled with waves caused by the collision of powerful crocodiles emerging from it, whose soft banks were breaking and falling into it due to the impact of the group of waves, which was making a 'su-su' sound due to colliding with the caves of large mountains, in which the rays of the sun were reflected in the bodies of the fish swimming above, from which the splashes of water were flying far and wide due to the roar of the crocodiles, and from which all the birds were flying away in fear, the bodies of all the vassals began to tremble with fear. They said to Rama, along with Lakshmana, "O Lord! Please take us across the river. O Padma! Be pleased. O Lakshmana! Be pleased with us servants who are full of devotion. O Devi! Lakshmana obeys you, so tell him." ||32-37||
Speaking these and many other words, those humble vassals jumped into that river and started flowing, performing various actions. ||38||
Then, Rama, standing calmly on the bank, said to them, "O good men! Now you return. This forest is very terrible. ||39||
This is the meeting point for you with us. This river has become a barrier for you, so be free from anxiety." ||40||
I
These vassals were ashamed and many were suffering in their minds due to fear. They were walking with them humbly. ||27||
Then, Rama and Lakshmana playfully reached the Pariyatra forest, which was filled with the roaring of lions and elephants. ||28||
In that forest, there was a dense darkness like the night of the dark fortnight, caused by large trees. There was a river called Sharvari, on whose banks many Shabaras (Bhil) lived. Rama and Lakshmana reached there. ||29||

1. This is the name of the forest.

## Chapter Thirty-Two

Bharata, the king, declared to all, "Be fearless, for I have been appointed as your king by my father."  ||4||

They bowed down and said, "O Lord, you are our refuge. Please be merciful and do not abandon us." ||42||

"Without you, the people are helpless and distraught. Tell us, who should we turn to? Who is like you?" ||43||

"We can live in the forest with you, even amidst a multitude of tigers, lions, elephants, and other dangerous creatures. But without you, we cannot even live in heaven." ||44||

"Our hearts do not yearn to return. How can we go back? This heart is the most important of all the senses." ||45||

"What use is a home, what use are possessions, what use are wives, what use are relatives, when you, the jewel among men, are leaving us? We are freed from our sins by you." ||46||

"O Lord, even in our games, you never deprived us of honor. Why are you being so harsh now?" ||47||

"O Lord, the benefactor of your servants, we have attained supreme prosperity through the dust of your feet. Tell us, what is our offense?" ||48||

"O Janaki, O Lakshmana, I bow my head to you both. Please appease the Lord on our behalf, for he is pleased with you and heeds your words." ||49||

Sita and Lakshmana, known for their gentle nature, stood silently before Rama's lotus feet, their eyes fixed on him, unable to speak. ||50||

Then Rama said, "O noble ones, this is the clear answer for you: return now. I am leaving. Stay at home and be happy." ||51||

Thus, the two brothers, free from any expectations, with great enthusiasm, entered the deep, mighty river. ||52||

Just as an elephant swims with a lotus in its trunk, Rama carried Sita, with her beautiful eyes, across the river. ||53||

Both of them, experts in water sports, enjoyed their playful journey. ||54||

This is the end of the meeting. Now, this river has become a boundary between us. So, be free from any anxiety. ||40||

Your father has made Bharata your king, so you all should remain fearless and seek refuge in him. ||41||

Padmapurana
Then Sita, standing in the palm of his hand, was shining brightly, as if Lakshmi were residing in a house made of a hundred lotus petals. ||55||  
Rama, whose body was a deterrent to the mind, crossed the river with Sita and Lakshmana, and in a moment, disappeared among the trees. ||56||
Then, with tears in their eyes, many kings, facing their palaces, made a great lamentation. ||57||
Some stood there, their eyes fixed on that direction, like clay figures, while others fainted and fell to the ground. ||58||
And some, having regained consciousness, said, "Fie on this fleeting world, and fie on the perishable pleasures, which are like the body of a serpent, causing fear." ||59||
If even these valiant heroes are in such a state, what of us, who are like the insignificant eranda plant? ||60||
Fie on this ungrateful body, which is subject to separation, death, disease, and old age, and is as insignificant as a bubble of water. ||61||
Those men, who are endowed with great fortitude, are fortunate, for they have renounced the fickle Lakshmi, which is like the eyebrow of a monkey, and have become initiated. ||62||
Thus, many noble men, having attained detachment, turned towards renunciation and wandered on that bank of the river. ||63||
Then they saw a high, vast, and auspicious temple, surrounded by a row of green trees. ||64||
That place of the temple was filled with various kinds of flowers, and buzzing bees were roaming there, enjoying the nectar. ||65||
They saw sages, endowed with great brilliance, sitting in secluded places, absorbed in their studies. ||66||
With folded hands on their heads, they bowed to them one by one, and then entered the very bright Jina temple. ||67||
At that time, the earth was adorned with Jina temples, built on the beautiful buttocks of the mountains, in the forests, and on the banks of the rivers. ||68||
1. As if made of clay, etc.
2. Like the hood of a serpent.
3. In the wise.

The Thirty-Second Chapter

Having paid homage to the Jinas, with pure thoughts, they went to the Muni Raja, who was as deep as the ocean of jewels. || 69 || Bowing their heads to him, who was filled with dispassion, they said, "O Lord, deliver us from this ocean of existence." || 70 || The leader of the Muni's, Satyaketa, replied, "So be it," and as soon as he spoke these words, they all attained supreme joy, saying, "Now we are liberated from the world." || 71 || Vidagdha, Vijay, Meru, Kror, Sangramalolupa, Srinagadaman, Dhir, Shatha, Shatrudama, Dhar, Vinod, Kantak, Satya, Kathora, and Priyavardhana, and many other kings, took the Digambara initiation. || 72-73 || Their servants, taking their elephants, horses, and armies, went quickly to the city to deliver their sons. At that time, the servants were very humble and filled with shame. || 74 || Many people, adorned with the jewels of right faith and right knowledge, took the Anuvrata and were eager to serve the holders of the Nirgrantha seal. || 75 || Others, having heard the very pure Dharma of the Jinas, who had conquered birth, were satisfied with right faith alone. || 76 || Many vassals went and informed Bharata of this news. Bharata was sitting happily, meditating on something, but he was saddened when he heard this news. || 77 ||

Then, King Dasharatha, who had attained right awakening, performed the coronation of Bharata, who was of a pure mind. He was somewhat distressed by the separation from Rama, and even though he was comforted, he was still very sorrowful. He left the palace and went out of the city, while his family, who were drowned in the ocean of sorrow, looked on. || 78-80 || Leaving the city, he went to the Guru, whose name was Sarvabhutahita, and performed a very great Guru puja. He was initiated along with seventy-two kings. || 81 || Although Muni Raja Dasharatha desired to meditate in solitude, his mind was polluted by the sorrow of his son. || 82 || One day, he reflected thus, "Alas, this affection is the root of all my suffering, this bondage of mine." || 83 || 

Page #110:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, those who were my wife, father, brother, son, etc. in past lives, where have they gone? In truth, in this beginningless cycle of existence, the number of my relations is countless. 

I have experienced countless pleasures in heaven and endured the burning flames of hell for the sake of enjoyment. 

In the realm of animals, I have endured the suffering of being eaten by others and other forms of pain for a long time. I have experienced many such painful experiences in various forms of life. 

I have heard the sounds of music played on flutes and lutes, and I have also heard the heart-wrenching cries of sorrow countless times. 

I have touched the breasts of beautiful Apsaras and have also been chopped to pieces by a sharp axe. 

I have tasted food that strengthens the body, is fragrant, and has six flavors. I have also drunk the molten lead and tin in the hell realms. 

I have seen the most beautiful forms that melt the heart, and I have also seen the most terrifying forms that cause trembling and fear. 

I have smelled the fragrant flowers that attract bees and bring joy, and I have also smelled the foul stench of decaying corpses that make people recoil. 

I have embraced women who steal hearts and adorn themselves with playful ornaments, and I have also embraced the thorny, deceptive trees of the Salmalia. 

As a slave to karma, what have I not done in this world? What have I not seen? What have I not smelled? What have I not heard? What have I not tasted? 

There is no earth, no water, no fire, no air that has not been part of my body during my countless journeys through this world. 

There is no living being in the three realms who has not been my father, etc., and there is no place where I have not lived. 

The body, pleasures, etc., are impermanent. There is no refuge for anyone. This cycle of existence has four stages, and I am the one who is suffering and seeking liberation.

Thirty-second Letter

I am different from this impure body, the senses are the many doors of karma. Restraint is the cause of their cessation, and from that, their destruction arises. || 97 || This world is of a strange form, the supreme knowledge is difficult to obtain. This Dharma, declared by the Jinas, has been attained by me with great effort. || 98 || With the pure meditation seen by the Munis, the wise Dasaratha gradually destroyed the aforementioned Artadhyana. || 99 || The king Dasaratha, who had a white umbrella over him and was riding on a superior elephant, had conquered the extremely arrogant enemies in the countries where he had fought great battles. Now, in those very countries, he was wandering as a completely detached Muni, peaceful and enduring the difficult circumstances. || 100-101 ||

After that, when the husband became a Muni and the son went abroad, Aparajita (Kaushalya) experienced supreme sorrow along with Sumitra. || 102 || Seeing both the mothers distressed, with tears flowing continuously from their eyes, Bharata considered the vast wealth of the kingdom, like Lakshmi, as dreadful as poison. || 103 || Then, seeing them extremely distressed, Kekayi's heart was filled with compassion, and prompted by it, she spoke to her son Bharata in this way: "O son, although you have obtained a kingdom where all kings are humbled, it does not shine without Rama and Lakshmana." || 104-105 || "What is the kingdom without those two virtuous brothers? What is the beauty of the country? And what is your righteousness?" || 106 || "The two children, having attained growth with happiness, along with the princess Sita, will be wandering somewhere without any vehicle, on a path full of stones and other obstacles?" || 107 || "These mothers of those two, who are like oceans of virtues, are extremely distressed, constantly lamenting. They might die in their separation." || 108 || "Therefore, bring them back quickly. With them, enjoy happiness for a long time and protect the earth. Only by doing so will everyone be prosperous." || 109 || "O dear son! Mount the swift horse and go, and I will follow you." || 110 || 

Upon hearing his mother's words, Bharata, filled with determination, said, "Yes, mother," and, accompanied by a thousand horses, set out on that path. || 111 ||

Padma Purana
Having sent the people who had returned from Padma's side ahead, he mounted a swift horse like the wind and went with great eagerness. || 112 || He reached the great forest, teeming with herds of elephants, covered with various trees, and terrifying with its mountains and ravines. || 113 || He tied together a multitude of boats with large logs of wood from the great trees, and crossed the terrifying river with his vehicles in a moment. || 114 || He went along, asking the people he met on the way, "Have you seen two men with a woman here?" and listening to the answers with a focused mind. || 115 || Then he saw Rama and Lakshmana, resting on the bank of a lake in the dense forest, with their bows beside them, along with Sita. || 116 || Bharat reached the place where Rama and Lakshmana had arrived after many days, due to Sita, in just six days. || 117 || He dismounted from his horse and walked on foot to the place where Rama was visible, and reaching him, embraced his feet and fainted. || 118 || Then Rama revived him, and after talking to him in turn, with his head bowed and hands joined, Padma spoke in this way: "Why, O Lord, have you done this mockery to me? You are the knower of justice, the supreme expert in all matters." || 119-120 || "What use is this kingdom to me, even with life, separated from you, the doer of the Guru's commands?" || 121 || "Arise, let us go to your city, be pleased with me, O Lord, rule the entire kingdom, and give me a state of happiness." || 122 || "I will be your umbrella-bearer, Shatrughna will wave the fly-whisk, and Lakshmana will be the chief minister, this is how everything will be right." || 123 || "My mother is burning with the fire of remorse, and your mother, Lakshmana's mother, is also constantly grieving." || 124 || While Bharat was speaking thus, Kekayi, riding in a swift chariot, surrounded by hundreds of vassals, 
1. filled with herds of elephants.

## Thirty-Second Chapter

Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, her heart filled with immense sorrow, Kekayi cried out loud, embracing them and weeping for a long time.  ||126||

Then, with a stream of tears flowing, she spoke to them, deeply distressed.  Addressing them in turn, she said, "My son, rise and go to the city. Rule the kingdom with your younger brothers. Without you, everything seems like a forest to me." ||127-128||

"This Bharata is worthy of your instruction.  He needs to be taught the right way.  My mind was clouded by my feminine nature. Forgive me for this wrong act." ||129||

Then, Rama said, "Mother, don't you know that Kshatriyas never go back on their word? Once they have accepted a task, they fulfill it." ||130||

"It is essential to ensure that my father's reputation is not tarnished in the three worlds." ||131||

Turning to Bharata, Rama said, "Brother, do not be troubled by this situation. If you are afraid of wrongdoing, then know that this is not wrong, as I myself am giving you permission for this." ||132||

Having said this, Rama performed Bharata's coronation in the beautiful forest, in the presence of all the kings. ||133||

Then, bowing to Kekayi, comforting her and speaking to her repeatedly, he embraced his brother and, with great difficulty, bid farewell to everyone. ||134||

Thus, Kekayi and Bharata, along with Sita, Rama, and Lakshmana, received proper treatment and returned as they had come. ||135||

Bharata, like his father, ruled the kingdom for the people. His reign was free from all enemies and brought happiness to all his subjects. ||136||

Despite this well-established kingdom, Bharata could not find peace for even a moment, as he carried the unbearable pain of sorrow in his heart. ||137||

He worshipped the Lord, the master of the three times, remained detached from worldly pleasures, and went to the temple to listen to the righteous teachings. ||138||

Padmapurana
There lived an Acharya named Dyuti, who was proficient in his own and other scriptures, and was constantly served by a large assembly of saints. || 135 || The wise Bharata made a vow in front of him, saying, "I will take the vows of a monk just by seeing Rama." || 140 || Hearing this vow, the Lord Dyuti, with a voice like the sound of a peacock's cry, said to Bharata: || 141 || "O noble one, until Rama, the one with eyes like lotus petals, arrives, you should practice the householder's dharma." || 142 || "The efforts of the great, liberated monks are extremely difficult, but for those who are mature through practice, it becomes easy to achieve." || 143 || "Many people with dull minds, who say, 'I will do penance later,' meet death before they can." || 144 || "It is impossible to describe the penance of the liberated monks, which is like a priceless jewel. How can there be any other comparison?" || 145 || "The Jinas have said that the householder's dharma is like the younger brother of the monk's dharma. One should be devoted to this dharma, which bestows enlightenment, without any negligence." || 146 || "Just as a man who goes to a jewel island finds every jewel he picks up to be priceless, so too, in the rule-based island of the Jinas, who turn the wheel of dharma, whoever takes up any rule becomes priceless." || 147-148 || "He who, with great devotion, worships the Jina Lord, holding the priceless jewel of non-violence, attains supreme growth in heaven." || 149 || "He who, adorned with the vow of truth, worships the Jinas with garlands, becomes a speaker whose words are accepted by all, and whose fame spreads throughout the world." || 150 || "He who, free from the sin of stealing, worships the Jina Lords, becomes the master of treasures filled with jewels." || 151 || "He who, serving the Jina Lords, does not desire other women, attains supreme good fortune, captivating the eyes of all." || 152 || He who, having taken the vow of...

## Chapter Thirty-Two

**By the merit of offering food, one becomes free from impurities and enjoys worldly pleasures. Even if one travels to foreign lands, one remains happy always.** || 154 ||

**By the merit of offering protection, one becomes fearless. Even if one faces great calamities, one remains free from troubles.** || 155 ||

**By the merit of offering knowledge, one becomes a recipient of vast happiness and enjoys the nectar of the ocean of arts as if it were a mere mouthful.** || 156 ||

**One who abstains from food during the night, even if engaged in all kinds of activities, attains a blissful state.** || 157 ||

**One who worships the Jinas with devotion three times a day, purifies their mind and destroys all their sins.** || 158 ||

**One who worships the Jinas with flowers born from earth and water, attains the Pushpaka Vimana and enjoys it as they please.** || 159 ||

**One who worships the Jinas with pure, flower-like devotion, becomes worthy of worship by all and attains great beauty.** || 160 ||

**One who offers incense made from sandalwood, aloe wood, and other fragrant substances to the Jinas, becomes a fragrant and divine being.** || 161 ||

**One who offers a lamp in the Jina temple with a pure heart, becomes a radiant being in the abode of the gods.** || 162 ||

**One who adorns the Jina temple with umbrellas, fly whisks, fans, banners, mirrors, and other such things, attains wondrous wealth.** || 163 ||

**One who anoints the Jinas with fragrant substances that fill the directions with their aroma, becomes a fragrant, joyful, and beloved person.** || 164 ||

**One who performs the abhisheka of the Jinas with fragrant water, receives the same abhisheka wherever they are born.** || 165 ||

**One who performs the abhisheka of the Jinas with a stream of milk, is born in a milk-white Vimana and becomes a radiant being.** || 166 ||

**One who performs the abhisheka of the Jinas with pots of yogurt, is born in a yogurt-colored heaven and becomes a supreme god.** || 167 ||

**One who performs the abhisheka of the Jinas with ghee, becomes a lord of Vimanas, full of radiance and brilliance.** || 168 ||

**One who worships the Jina with devotion, keeping their mind focused, attains immense benefits and is worshipped by all.** || 153 || 

Page #116:
---------------------------
The Padma Purana states that many wise men are mentioned as having received abhisheka (consecration) due to its influence. The Purana also mentions that Anantavirya and others attained abhisheka in the celestial realm. (169)

Whoever offers a garland or other gifts to the Jina with devotion, attains supreme prosperity and health, becoming a person of good mind. (170)

Whoever celebrates a grand festival with songs, dances, and musical instruments in the Jina temple, attains the supreme festival in heaven. (171)

Who can describe the enjoyment and celebration of the person who builds a Jina temple, O wise one? (172)

Whoever builds an image of the Jinas, soon attains the supreme happiness of the gods and demons and reaches the supreme state. (173)

The virtues of vows, knowledge, austerities, and charity acquired by a living being in all three periods of time and in all three realms cannot equal the merit generated by the creation of even a single image of the Jina. (174-175)

When beings attain this stated fruit in heaven and are born again in the cycle of existence, they enjoy it even there, having attained the position of a Chakravarti and others. (176)

Whoever practices Dharma in this way, having become a human being, crosses the ocean of existence and resides at the peak of the three realms. (177)

The fruit of contemplation is equivalent to one day of fasting, the fruit of aspiration is equivalent to three days of fasting, the fruit of beginning to go is equivalent to four days of fasting, the fruit of going is equivalent to five days of fasting, the fruit of reaching a certain point is equivalent to twelve days of fasting, the fruit of reaching the middle is equivalent to fifteen days of fasting, the fruit of seeing the temple is equivalent to a month of fasting, the fruit of entering the temple courtyard is equivalent to six months of fasting, the fruit of entering the gate is equivalent to a year of fasting, the fruit of circumambulating is equivalent to a hundred years of fasting, the fruit of seeing the face of the Jina is equivalent to a thousand years of fasting, and the fruit of naturally praising is equivalent to infinite years of fasting. Indeed, there is no greater merit than devotion to the Jinas. (178-182)

The Acharya Dyutis says, "O Bharata! By devotion to the Jinas, karma is destroyed, and one who has destroyed karma attains a state of incomparable happiness." (183)

## Thirty-Second Chapter

Having said this, Bharata, filled with utmost devotion, bowed down to his Guru's feet and accepted the householder's Dharma in a proper manner. ||184||

Well-versed in scriptures, a knower of Dharma's essence, humble and filled with faith, Bharata generously donated to the worthy ones as per their needs. ||185||

Carrying the jewel of Right Faith in his heart, he ruled his vast kingdom, dedicated to virtuous deeds. ||186||

His prowess and affection, like an ocean of virtues, spread throughout the land without any hindrance. ||187||

He had one hundred and fifty wives, radiant like goddesses, yet he remained unattached to them, just like a lotus remains unattached to water. ||188||

Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! Bharata's mind was always filled with the thought, 'When will I receive the Nirgrantha initiation? When will I renounce all attachments and wander the earth, performing severe austerities?'" ||189||

Those brave men on earth are blessed who, renouncing all attachments and burning all karmas through the power of austerities, have attained the supreme state of liberation, filled with the bliss of contentment. ||190||

"I am a sinner, immersed in the sorrows of the world, even though I see the impermanence of everything. The people seen in the morning are not seen in the evening, yet I remain foolish." ||191||

"This person, with a sorrowful face, living among relatives, is freed from snakes, water, poison, fire, thunderbolts, weapons thrown by enemies, and even death itself." ||192||

**Sub-Chapter**

This person, though experiencing thousands of kinds of suffering through various types of death, is still unconcerned. It seems as if a drunk man, fearless of the waves surging with great speed, is sleeping on the shore of the salt ocean. || 193 || Alas! Alas! I, being engrossed in the kingdom and heavy with sins, will fall into which terrible hell, where there is darkness caused by weapons like arrows, swords, and discs, and trees like Salmali and mountains? Or will I be born in the animal realm, which is full of various species? || 194 || Even after obtaining the Jain Dharma, my mind is still attached to sins and is not attaining dispassion and embracing the monastic Dharma, which is capable of liberating me. || 195 || Thus, constantly engrossed in the thought that is the cause of the destruction of evil deeds, and always immersed in the stories of ancient sages, King Bharata did not look towards the sun or the moon. || 196 ||

Thus ends the thirty-second chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarsha" (ancient), composed by Acharya Ravishena, which describes the initiation of King Dasharatha, Rama's exile to the forest, and Bharata's coronation. || 32 ||

The Thirty-Third Chapter

Then, Rama, leaving behind the regions fit for human enjoyment, reached the beautiful hermitages of the ascetics. There dwelt ascetics with matted hair, wearing various barks, and the earth was like a tree laden with sweet fruits. [1-2]

The hermitages were covered with large leaves, and had platforms for sitting, sometimes adorned with piles of Palasa and Udumbara wood. [3]

Their courtyards were filled with un-sown, self-grown grain drying in the sun, and were adorned with deer chewing their cud in peace. [4]

The courtyards were filled with calves, with matted hair, constantly mooing, and with their beautiful tails raised high. [5]

The hermitages were filled with parrots, mynas, and owls, with clear voices, sitting in the shade of beautiful flowering creepers. [6]

The hermitages were adorned with young trees, their beds watered by maidens, who considered them as their brothers. [7]

The ascetics welcomed them with great respect, offering them various fruits, fragrant flowers, sweet water, words of welcome, food offered with reverence, sweet conversation, gifts of huts, and beds of soft leaves. [8-9]

These ascetics were naturally hospitable, and their virtue was even more evident in the presence of such beautiful men. [10]

When Rama and Lakshmana were about to leave, the ascetics came to their path. Their form could melt even stones, what to speak of others? [11]

The ascetics of that hermitage had never seen such beauty. They lived on dry leaves and air, and when they saw Sita's beauty, they...

## Chapter 102 of the Padma Purana

Padma Purana

The aged ascetics, again and again, consoled them with soothing words. "Even if you do not stay in our ashram, please listen to us." ||13||

Though these forests are filled with all kinds of hospitality, do not trust them, just like you wouldn't trust women or rivers. You are wise. ||14||

Seeing Rama and Lakshmana, with their lotus-like eyes, the wives of the ascetics abandoned all their tasks. Their entire bodies became void. ||15||

Some women, filled with anxiety, their eyes fixed on their path, wandered far away under the pretext of some other task, their minds bewildered. ||16||

Some women, with sweet words, said, "Why don't you stay in our ashram? We will do everything for you as needed." ||17||

Beyond three kos, lies a great forest, devoid of human presence, filled with huge trees and teeming with lions, tigers, and other beasts. ||18||

It is extremely terrifying, filled with sharp blades of grass. Even ascetics do not go there to gather fuel or flowers. ||19||

Ahead lies the very difficult to reach, massive mountain called Chitrakoot. Do you not know that it is filled with anger? ||20||

Rama and Lakshmana replied, "O ascetics! We must go there." Thus urged, they reluctantly turned back, and even while returning, they continued to speak of their journey for a long time. ||21||

Then they entered a great forest, rough and rugged with the cliffs of the earth and mountains, filled with a tangle of vines climbing up huge trees. ||22||

Where tigers, enraged by hunger, were tearing at the trees with their claws. Where the ground was stained with the blood and pearls from the tusks of elephants slain by lions. ||23||

Where wild elephants had stripped the bark from the trunks of huge trees with their shoulders. Where deer, terrified by the roar of lions, were running in all directions. ||24||

Where caves were filled with the breath of sleeping pythons. Where small ponds were being churned up by the impact of the snouts of herds of boars. ||25||

Where the ground was covered with mounds of earth, ignited by the tips of the horns of large buffaloes. Where the earth was trembling with the movement of huge, terrifying snakes. ||26||

Their minds were disturbed, and they lost their composure. ||12|| 

Page #121:

The Thirty-Third Chapter
103
Where flies were buzzing around the blood of deer killed by wolves, and where herds of chital were restless with their tails entangled in thorny bushes. ||27||
Where it was adorned with various arrows left by proud she-hunters, and where many creatures were roaming around, intoxicated by the smell of poisonous flower pollen. ||28||
Where water was dripping from the trunks of trees broken by the impact of rhinoceroses and elephants, and where herds of gavaya had broken the leaves of trees while running around. ||29||
Where the harsh sounds of various flocks of birds were echoing, and where the upper parts of trees were swaying due to the attack of monkey groups. ||30||
Where the earth was eroded by hundreds of fast-flowing mountain streams, and where the rays of the sun were shining brightly on the tops of trees. ||31||
Where it was filled with various flowers and fruits, fragrant with a variety of scents, full of various herbs, and abundant with wild grains. ||32||
Where it was blue in some places, yellow in some places, red in some places, green in some places, and tawny in some places. ||33||
There, in the beautiful waterfalls of Chitrakoot, they played, showed each other beautiful things, ate delicious and delightful fruits, sang sweet songs that shamed the Kinnaris, adorned each other with flowers born of water and land, and smeared their bodies with fragrant liquids from trees, thus wandering as if they had only come out for a stroll in a garden. Their beautiful eyes were blooming, they adorned their bodies as they wished, and they stole the eyes of creatures. ||34-37||
They rested again and again in groves that stole the eyes, they told various stories, and they played various games. ||38||
Moving with great beauty by nature, they wandered through that beautiful forest, just as the gods do in Nandana. ||39||
Thus, in less than five months, they crossed that place and reached the very beautiful Avanti country, filled with people. 1. The harsh sound of various flocks of birds echoed. 2. The earth was eroded. 

Page #122:
---------------------------
The land was filled with the sound of bells tied around the necks of cows, adorned with various grains, vast and filled with villages and towns. ||40-41||
After that, the three, bearing beautiful forms, crossed a great distance and reached a vast place deserted by humans. ||42||
Sitting in the shade of a banyan tree, they rested and asked each other why this place appeared devoid of people. ||43||
Here, many ripe fields of grain are visible, these trees in the gardens are adorned with fruits and flowers. ||44||
Villages are situated on high ground, filled with ponds and sugarcane groves, lakes with unplucked lotuses are filled with various birds. ||45||
This path is filled with broken pots, carts, baskets, trash, kundikas, and mats. ||46||
Here, rice, black gram, green gram, and soup are scattered, and here this old bull lies dead, with a torn old sack on top of it. ||47||
This vast country does not appear beautiful without people, just as a person who has taken vows does not appear beautiful when he is attached to worldly things. ||48||
Then, sitting on a very soft, jeweled blanket, Rama, while discussing the desolation of the country, placed his bow nearby. ||49||
Sita, who was the embodiment of love and a reservoir of water, with hands as soft as the inner petals of a lotus, was ready to quickly give Rama rest, that is, to massage his feet. ||50||
Then, Lakshmana, who knew the proper order of things, with the permission of his elder brother, separated Sita, who was leaning against his thigh, and began to massage his feet himself. ||51||
Rama said to Lakshmana, "Brother, your wife is very tired, so quickly find a village, a town, or a settlement of cowherds." ||52||
Then Lakshmana climbed to the top of a large tree. Rama asked him, "Do you see anything here?" ||53||
Lakshmana said, "O Lord! I see mountains that resemble silver, high like autumn clouds, adorned with peaks." ||54||
1. Charu M. 

Page #123:
---------------------------
105
I am seeing those Jain temples which are adorned with peaks, which have Jain images in their upper front part, which are equipped with excellent gardens and on which white flags are fluttering. ||55|| I am also seeing villages surrounded by long and wide tanks and green fields of paddy and cities which are comparable to Gandharvanagara. ||56|| Thus, very large settlements are visible but not a single human being is seen in them. ||57|| Has the population here perished along with their entire families or have the cruel-deeds-performing Mlechchas taken them captive? ||58|| A human-like figure is visible from a great distance, which is not a stump but seems to be a human being because his nature is fickle. ||59|| But it is not clear whether he is going or coming. After observing carefully for a while, Lakshmana said, "It seems he is coming. Okay, let him come on the path, then I will be able to know him specifically." ||60|| Lakshmana then looked again and said, "This man is coming quickly, like a frightened deer. His hair is rough and standing, he is meek, his body is polluted with dirt, he is sweating and showing his past evil deeds." ||61-62||
Rama said to Lakshmana, "Bring him here quickly." Then Lakshmana descended and went near him with wonder. ||63|| Seeing Lakshmana, the man's hair stood on end. He was filled with wonder and slowed down his pace, thinking in his mind ||64|| that this one who has come down, shaking the tree, is he Indra? Or is he Varuna? Or is he a Daitya? Or is he a Naga? Or is he a Kinnara? Or is he a human being? Or is he Yama? Or is he the Moon? Or is he Agni? Or is he Kubera? Or is he the Sun who has come to the earth? Or who is this bearer of a superior body? ||65-66|| Thinking thus, his eyes closed due to great fear, his body became motionless and he fell unconscious on the earth. ||67|| Seeing this, Lakshmana said, "O noble one! Get up, get up, don't be afraid." After a while, when he regained consciousness, Lakshmana took him to Rama. ||68||

The Jain, with a face as gentle as the moon, beautiful in every way, his eyes like a sea of radiance, a festival for the eyes, and adorned by the ever-humble Sita at his side, saw Rama. The man immediately cast off the weariness born of hunger and toil.  He bowed, touching the ground with his forehead, and said, "Rest in the shade."  He then sat down. 

The Jain, his words like a stream of nectar, asked, "O blessed one, from where do you come, and what is your name?"

The man replied, "I come from a distant place, and my name is Kshiragupti."  When the Jain asked, "Why is this land devoid of people?" he continued, "The king of Ujjayini, known as Singhodara, is renowned for his prowess. He has subdued all his vassals, and he is like a god.  The king of Dasangapur, Vajrakarn, is his most beloved servant, and he has performed many wondrous deeds.  He bows only to the Lord of the Jinas, the master of the three worlds, and to the Nirgrantha monks.  He does not bow to anyone else.  Have you not heard that his excellent Samyak Darshan, the result of the blessings of the holy ones, has become famous throughout the land?"

Lakshmana, who understood the Jain's intentions, asked, "Brother, how did the holy one bestow his grace upon him? Tell me."

The traveler replied, "O Lord, I will tell you briefly how the holy one bestowed his grace upon him.  Once, Vajrakarn, eager to hunt, entered the forest near Dasaranapura, a forest teeming with life.  From birth, he was known throughout the world as a cruel man, a slave to his senses, a fool, averse to good conduct, attached to the idea of possessions, blind to subtle truths, and corrupted by the demon of pride born of enjoyment.  While wandering through the forest, he saw a holy man, a dweller in perfect peace, sitting on a rock in the midst of a grove of Kanneer trees.  The holy man had renounced all worldly attachments, had attained the state of perfect discipline, and was as fearless as a bird, as strong as a lion.

## Chapter Thirty-Three

He was being scorched from all sides by the rays of the sun, like a righteous man being tormented by hundreds of harsh words from a wicked person. || 85 || Seeing him, Vajrakarn, who appeared like Yama, mounted on a horse, spoke to the sage, who was like a deep ocean of jewels, a dwelling place of ultimate truth, a destroyer of sin, filled with compassion for all beings, and adorned with the glory of a Shraman. || 86-87 || "What are you doing here, O sage?" The sage replied, "I am doing what is beneficial for the soul, something that has not been done even in hundreds of past lives." || 88 || The king, Vajrakarn, laughed and said, "In this state, you have no happiness, how can there be any benefit for the soul?" || 89 || "What benefit is there for the soul of one whose beauty and form are lost, who is devoid of desire and wealth, who has no clothes, and who has no support?" || 90 || "How can there be any benefit for the soul of those like you, who are devoid of baths and ornaments, and who depend on the food given by others?" || 91 || Seeing the king, who was tormented by desires, the compassionate sage, restrained, said, "Why do you ask me about benefit, when you are bound by the chains of hope? Ask those who are deceived by the senses, who are far from the means of benefit, and who are wandering in the ocean of delusion, driven by excessive attachment." || 92-93 || "This one, who is intent on destroying thousands of beings, who is devoted to the destruction of the soul, and who is devoid of right understanding, will surely fall into a terrible hell." || 94 || "You must not have known about the terrible hells, for you take great delight in sins, rising again and again." || 95 || "There are seven hells below this earth, which are extremely terrible, filled with a terrible stench, extremely difficult to see, extremely painful to touch, and extremely difficult to cross." || 96 || "They are filled with sharp thorns of iron, crowded with various kinds of instruments, filled with mountains as sharp as the edge of a razor, and their bottoms are more painful than molten iron." || 97 || "They are filled with loud sounds, great darkness, and great fear. They are covered with forests of swords and filled with rivers of alkali." || 98 || 

The sage had no covering of any kind on his body. He was sitting in the sun, fulfilling his vows, fearless like a bird, and fearless like a lion. || 84 || 

Page #126:

108
In the Padma Purana, it is said that those who are entangled in sinful deeds and are unrestrained like elephants, experience thousands of sorrows in those worlds.  ||99|| I ask you, what good do those who are afflicted by worldly desires and are attached to sin do for themselves? ||100|| You think that by enjoying sensual pleasures, which are like the fruits of the Kimpaka tree, day after day, you are doing good for yourself. ||101||  Oh, the one who does good for himself is the one who is compassionate towards all beings, who is wise, pure in mind, a sage, or a householder. ||102|| Those who are devoted to the great vows have done good for themselves, while those who are attached to the minor vows are destined for suffering. ||103|| You have come here to this world after performing good deeds in the other world, but now you will go to hell by committing sins in this world. ||104|| These innocent, small, pitiful deer of the forest, who are orphans, have restless eyes, are constantly anxious, live on grass and water, are filled with many sorrows, are experiencing the consequences of their past sins, and are so frightened that they cannot sleep even at night, are not worthy of being killed by noble men who follow righteous conduct. ||105-107|| Therefore, O King, I tell you, if you want your own good, then give up violence in thought, word, and deed, and strive to practice non-violence. ||108|| When the king was thus enlightened by this beneficial and instructive speech, he became humble like a tree laden with fruits. ||109|| He dismounted from his horse and walked on foot, and with his knees bent, hands clasped, and head bowed, he prostrated himself before those excellent sage-kings. ||110|| He greeted them with a gentle gaze, saying, "Oh, today I have seen the praiseworthy, renunciant sage-kings!" ||111|| These birds and deer who live in the forest are fortunate to see these meditating sages seated on the rock. ||112|| Today I am also very fortunate to be free from sinful karma, because I have been blessed with the company of these virtuous ones. ||113|| 

Page #127:
---------------------------
## Chapter Thirty-Three

Having broken the bonds of familial affection with the nails of knowledge, the Lord has emerged from the cage of the world, like a lion. ||114||

Behold, by this virtuous one, the enemy of the mind is subdued. By the grace of nakedness, the abode of virtue is attained. ||115||

"My soul is not yet satisfied. Therefore, I will remain in this household and find contentment in the delightful practice of Anuvrata." ||116||

Thinking thus, he accepted the householder's dharma from the Muni. With a heart overflowing with emotion, he made this vow: "I will not bow to anyone other than the Lord of Lords, the Supreme Soul, the unchanging Jina, and the liberated Munis, the great ones, the free from attachments." ||117-118||

With great reverence, he performed a grand puja for the Muni, known as Pritivardhana, and observed a fast with a steady mind. ||119||

The virtuous one instructed the king, seated nearby, about the supreme benefit: "By worshipping this, the embodied beings are liberated from the world." ||120||

"There are two types of excellent conduct: Sagara and Anagara. The first, with its dependence on external objects, is for householders. The second, free from dependence on external objects, is for the Munis, who wear the sky as their garment." ||121||

"Purity of vision, combined with austerity and knowledge, is well-known in the Jina's teachings, as the first and other stages of Anuyoga." ||122||

Understanding the extreme difficulty of the conduct of the liberated Munis, the king again and again considered the practice of Anuvrata. ||123||

Realizing that he had attained the supreme Dharma-Dhyana, he was filled with immense joy, as if a poor man had found a great treasure. ||124||

Seeing the king, who had been so cruel, now pacified, the Muni was also filled with great joy. ||125||

Then, the Muni, the bearer of the Yajna of virtue, went to another place suitable for austerity. The king, filled with supreme glory, remained there. He was content with the great benefit he had received. ||126||

The next day, having honored the guest as prescribed, and having performed the Parana, the king bowed at the Muni's feet and returned to his palace. ||127|| 

Page #128:
---------------------------
## Chapter 110 of the Padma Purana

110
Padma Purana
Carrying the supreme Lord in his heart, Vajrakarn always honored his Guru. He was free from doubt and thus he was filled with anxiety. ||128||
"Being a servant of the powerful Singhodara, how can I enjoy pleasures without showing him respect? If I don't, he will punish me. How can I enjoy pleasures in such a situation?" ||129||
While thinking this, his pure heart was guided by fate and he had this thought. ||130||
"I will make a golden ring with the image of Muni Suvrata Swami and wear it on my right thumb. This will be my way of paying respects." ||131||
He then had the ring made, adorned with a beautiful base, and with a joyful heart, he wore it on his thumb. ||132||
Standing before Singhodara, with his thumb raised, the noble king continuously paid his respects to the image. ||133||
On another occasion, a jealous enemy, with a mind full of deceit, told Singhodara about this. The wicked Singhodara was filled with anger. ||134||
Driven by his pride and power, he decided to kill Vajrakarn and deceitfully summoned him to his palace in Dashang Nagar. ||135||
Vajrakarn, the son of Brihadgata, was a pure-hearted man. He readily agreed to go, accompanied by a hundred horsemen. ||136||
A man with a staff in his hand, a large and imposing figure, adorned with a saffron tilak, approached Vajrakarn and said, ||137-138||
"O King! If you are indifferent to pleasures and your body, then go to Ujjayini. Otherwise, you are not worthy of going." ||138||
"O King! Singhodara is angry with you for not paying him respects. He is ready to kill you. Do as you please." ||139||
Hearing this, Vajrakarn thought, "Some jealous and wicked person is trying to create a rift between me and Singhodara." He was slightly troubled by this. He asked, "Who are you? What is your name? Where do you come from?" ||140|| 

Page #129:

The Thirty-Third Chapter

111. How did you come to know this extremely difficult mantra? O Bhadra, tell me this. I wish to know it completely. ||142||

He said, "In Kundanagara, there lived a merchant named Samudrasangama, who was devoted to accumulating wealth. His wife's name was Yamuna. I am their son. My mother gave birth to me during a time when the sky was filled with lightning, so my relatives named me Vidyudanga." ||143-144||

"Gradually, as I reached youth, I came to this city of Ujjayini, equipped with the knowledge of commerce, to earn wealth." ||145||

"Here, I saw a courtesan named Kamalata and was struck by the arrow of love. Since then, I have been tormented, finding no peace day or night." ||146||

"I thought, 'Let me spend one night with her.' This desire bound me tightly, like a net binds a deer." ||147||

"My father had accumulated a great fortune over many years, but I, his son, squandered it all in just six months." ||148||

"Just as a bee is attached to a lotus, my mind, afflicted by lust, is attached to that courtesan. What is there that a man will not do for women?" ||149||

"One day, I heard her criticizing her own earrings to her friend, saying, 'What use are these earrings to me, a burden on my ears? Blessed is the queen Shridhara, who enjoys great fortune, and whose ears are adorned with beautiful jeweled earrings.'" ||150-151||

"Hearing this, I thought, 'If I don't steal that excellent earring and fulfill her desire, what is the use of my life?'" ||152||

"Driven by this desire, I disregarded my own dear life and went to the king's palace, shrouded in the darkness of night." ||153||

"There, I heard Queen Shridhara asking Singhudara, 'My lord, why are you not getting any sleep today? Why do you seem so troubled?'" ||154||

He said, "O Devi, how can I sleep when my mind is troubled? Until I kill Vajrakarn, who turns his face away from me in disrespect, I will not find peace." ||155||

The one who was experiencing great joy and also some sorrow, asked the Datta who he was and where he came from. ||140-141|| 

Page #130:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
The one consumed by humiliation, tormented by anxiety,
Whose efforts against Ajita have been in vain, whose strength is broken by a deceitful woman,
Who is burdened with wounds, impoverished, and terrified by the suffering of the world,
Sleep flees far away, as if it were a compassionate friend. ||156-157||
If I do not kill this Vajrakarn, who turns away from my salutations,
Then what use is life to me, who am devoid of energy? ||158||
Then, as if struck by a thunderbolt in my heart,
I took this secret jewel and, abandoning the desire for earrings,
Came to you, knowing that your mind is always devoted to Dharma and that you constantly serve the virtuous.
O Lord! Knowing this, please turn back, do not go to Ujjain. ||159-160||
By your command, this entire path of the city is blocked by elephants with the color of the Anjanagiri mountains, whose cheeks drip with intoxication, by horses of great speed, by warriors clad in armor, and by cruel chieftains eager to kill you. ||161-162||
Therefore, O lover of Dharma! Be pleased, quickly turn back, I fall at your feet. Please heed my words. ||163||
O King! If you do not believe me, then look, the enemy army, covered in dust and making a great clamor, has arrived. ||164||
Seeing the enemy army approaching, Vajrakarn, with his lightning-like steed, turned back. ||165||
And entering his fortified city, he stood firm, prepared for battle, with his wise men. The chieftains stood guard at the gates. ||166||
Hearing that Vajrakarn had entered the city, Singhodar, burning with anger, arrived with his entire army. ||167||
Because Vajrakarn's city was extremely fortified, and fearing the loss of his army, the king Singhodar did not immediately decide to attack. ||168||
But he stationed his army nearby and quickly sent a messenger. That messenger went to Vajrakarn and, with great cruelty, said, 

Page #131:

## The Thirty-Third Chapter

**113**  The one whose mind is always filled with the **Jain** teachings, and who is devoid of good intentions, is a thorn in my prosperity. **17**

**114**  Skilled in breaking families, encouraged by **Shramanas** with deceitful actions, you have reached this state, devoid of any principles. **17**

**115**  You enjoy the land given by me and yet you bow to the **Arhat**. Oh, what a great deception you have, you with a wicked heart! **172**

**116**  You are wise, so come to me quickly and offer your respects. Otherwise, see, you are going to meet death. **173**

**117**  Then, after hearing these words, the messenger went back and told **Singhodara** this: "O Lord! **Vajreshruti** says with certainty: 'O **Vibho**, take the city, the army, the treasury, and the land, but give me the door to **Dharma**, that is, do not hinder my devotion to **Dharma**." **174-175**

**118**  "I have made a vow that I will not bow to anyone other than the **Arhat** and the **Nirgrantha Guru**. I will not break this vow even in death. You are the master of my wealth, but not of my body." **176**

**119**  Even after hearing this, **Singhodara** did not give up his anger. He besieged the city and set it ablaze, thus making the land desolate. **177**

**120**  "I have told you the reason for the desolation of this land. Now I am going to my own desolate village nearby." **178**

**121**  "In that village, there were beautiful mansions, like flying machines, which were burnt down. Along with them, my humble hut, made of straw and wood, was also burnt." **179**

**122**  "I have hidden a pot, a pitcher, and a bowl in that hut. I am going to retrieve them, driven by the woman who speaks wicked words." **180**

**123**  "There are many household items to be found in deserted villages. You should also bring them," she keeps telling me. **181**

**124**  "Or perhaps she has done me a great favor. O Lord! By virtue of my good deeds, I have been able to see you." **182**

**125**  Seeing the traveler in distress, **Rama** was filled with compassion and gave him his own jeweled golden thread. **183**

**126**  The traveler, bowing down, took the thread and, with a cheerful heart, returned to his own abode, becoming like a king. **184**

Then the Sun said to Lakshmana, "O Lakshmana, until the extreme heat of the summer becomes unbearable, let us rise and go to the nearby region of this city. Janaki is thirsty, so quickly arrange for food." 185-186
Having said this, they all went to the excellent Chaitya-alaya of Chandra-prabha in the city of Dasanga. 187
There, after bowing to the Jina, Rama, along with Sita, stayed comfortably in the same Chaitya-alaya, and Lakshmana, carrying his bow, went out to obtain food. 188
When he was about to enter the camp of King Singhodara, the guards, shouting loudly, stopped him in the same way that mountains stop the wind. 189
"What purpose do I have in opposing these low-born people?" Thinking this, the wise Lakshmana went towards the city. 190
When he reached the city gate, which was protected by many warriors and on which Vajrakarna was seated with great effort, 191
his servants said, "Who are you? Where do you come from? And why have you come?" In response, Lakshmana said, "I have come from a great distance, desiring to obtain food." 192
Then, seeing the beautiful boy, Vajrakarna, filled with wonder, said, "Come, enter quickly." 193
Thereafter, pleased, Lakshmana went to Vajrakarna, dressed in a humble manner. There, all the people looked at him with great respect. 194
Vajrakarna said to a close associate, "Quickly, give this man the food that has been prepared for me. Let him be fed with respect." 195
Hearing this, Lakshmana said, "I will not eat here. My elder brother, my Guru, is staying nearby. I will first feed him, so I am taking this food to him." 196
"So be it," said the king, and he gave him a large amount of food, filled with the finest dishes and drinks. 197
Lakshmana took it and went to Rama with double speed. They all ate it in order and, having eaten, attained supreme satisfaction. 198
1. Lakshmana is this. 2. Goes. 3. Being protected. 4. Stopped by the force of the wind. 5. By these. 

Page #133:
---------------------------
## The Thirty-Third Chapter

115. Then, pleased, Padma said, "Look, Lakshmana, at the virtuous nature of Vajrakarn, who has done this without any introduction.  Even for a son-in-law, such fine food is not given.  Oh, the coolness of the drinks and the sweetness of the dishes are truly amazing!  With this food, like nectar, the fatigue caused by the journey has been instantly removed, and our weariness has vanished completely.  These rice grains, white as if made from ground moonbeams, are soft and free from impurities.  This drink, made from the essence of the moon, is extremely pure and attracts bees with its fragrance.  This ghee and milk seem to have been produced from the udder of a wish-fulfilling cow, for such distinct flavors are hard to find in dishes.  The traveler was right to say that this virtuous man is a follower of the Anuvrata, for who else would treat guests with such respect?  He is known to be a pure-souled, wise man who is devoted only to the Jina, the destroyer of the sorrows of the world.  If such a man of character and virtue is in front of us, surrounded by enemies, then our lives are meaningless.  He is free from wrongdoing, dedicated to the service of the virtuous, and all his vassals are loyal to their unique lord.  Even Bharat, the new king, cannot protect this Vajrakarn, who is being oppressed by the wicked king Singhodara.  Therefore, quickly protect this wise man, who is without other protection, and go tell Singhodara."

110. "Should I say this, should I say that?"  Why are you being taught?  You are born with wisdom, like a great jewel with brilliance.  After praising your virtues, and placing the order on your head, say, "As you command," and bow down, filled with love and devotion.

## Chapter 116 of the Padma Purana

Padma Purana
Wearing a humble attire, without carrying a bow, Lakshmana, shaking the earth, arrived swiftly. ||23||
Seeing him, the guards asked, "Whose man are you?" He replied, "I am a messenger of King Bharata." ||24||
Passing through the vast camp, he reached the king's abode. He was announced by the gatekeepers and entered the court of King Singhodara. ||215||
Considering the king as insignificant as a blade of grass, he spoke clearly, "O Singhodara! Know me as the messenger of my elder brother." ||216||
"The virtuous King Bharata commands you thus: What benefit is there in this baseless enmity?" ||217||
Then Singhodara, bearing a harsh heart, spoke, "O messenger! Tell King Bharata from me: Masters strive to bring their unrefined servants to humility. What opposition is there in this?" ||218-219||
"This Vajrakarna is wicked, arrogant, deceitful, extremely vile, wrathful, petty, eager to slander his friends, lazy, foolish, his intellect seized by a demon or wind, devoid of good conduct, pretending to be wise, and engaged in evil deeds. These vices will leave him either through subjugation or death. I will devise a plan for him. You remain silent in this matter." ||220-222||
Then Lakshmana said, "What purpose is served by further replies? Since he does good for all, let all his offenses be forgiven." ||223||
Hearing this, Singhodara, whose anger was blazing and who was averse to peace, looked at his assembly and roared, "Not only is this wicked Vajrakarna arrogant, but this messenger, who has come out of desire for his master's work, is also equally arrogant." ||224-225||
"O messenger! It seems your body is made of stone. This wicked servant of the King of Ayodhya, does not possess even a shred of humility. He is completely..." ||226||

The most excellent of the three worlds,
In that land, all men are surely like you.
By the doctrine of the pot and the rice, it is known indirectly. || 227 ||

Thus having spoken, Lakshmana, the bearer of Lakshmi, was filled with anger.
I have come for the sake of equality, not to bow to you. || 228 ||

Hear this in brief, O Singhodara.
Accept peace now, or embrace death today. || 229 ||

Hearing this, the entire assembly was filled with extreme anger.
They spoke many kinds of harsh words and performed various actions. || 230 ||

Some warriors, their bodies trembling with anger, drew their daggers,
And some drew their swords, ready to kill him. || 231 ||

They roared with speed, and were extremely agitated.
They surrounded him from all sides, like mosquitoes around a mountain. || 232 ||

The wise and valiant Lakshmana, skilled in swift action,
Flung those who could not come close, far away, with kicks. || 233 ||

Moving swiftly, he struck some with his knees, some with his elbows,
And some with punches, shattering them into a hundred pieces. || 234 ||

He pulled the hair of some, threw them to the ground, and crushed them with his feet,
And he knocked some down with blows from his shoulders. || 235 ||

He crushed the heads of some by making them collide with each other,
And he rendered some unconscious with blows from his shins. || 236 ||

Thus, that mighty Lakshmana, alone, destroyed that assembly of Singhodara,
Filling them with fear. || 237 ||

As he was thus destroying the assembly, and had come out of the building into the courtyard,
He was surrounded by hundreds of other warriors. || 238 ||

Then, a great commotion arose from the clashing of the lords, elephants, horses, and chariots,
All prepared for battle. || 239 ||

The valiant Lakshmana, embraced by Lakshmi, with various weapons in his hands,
Behaved like a lion among jackals. || 240 ||

In the Padma Purana, having mounted many elephants, Simhodara, whose form resembled a rain-laden cloud, himself, roared like a lion, and advanced towards Lakshmana, the abode of Lakshmi. ||241|| Those Samantas who had fled far away, seeing Simhodara at the head of the battle, regained some courage and returned. ||242|| Just as a flock of clouds surrounds the moon, so did those Samantas surround Lakshmana. But just as a strong wind scatters a heap of cotton, so did he scatter those Samantas, driving them away. ||243|| The noble women, with their hands placed on their cheeks, their eyes trembling with fear, were saying to each other, "Oh friends! Look at this terrible man. This one is surrounded by many cruel Samantas. This is highly inappropriate." ||244-245|| Some of those women were saying, "Even though he is alone, who can defeat him? Look, he has struck many warriors and made them bewildered." ||246|| 

Seeing the army gathering in front, Lakshmana laughed and uprooted a large pillar used for tying elephants. ||247|| And just as a fierce fire in the forest grows stronger, so did Lakshmana, filled with a terrible roar, charge towards the army. ||248|| Vajrakarn, the king of Dashangapur, sitting on the top of the gate, was astonished at this sight. The nearby Samantas, whose eyes were filled with joy, said to him, "Oh king! Look, this man, possessing supreme brilliance, is destroying Simhodara's army. He has broken all their flags, chariots, and umbrellas." ||249-250|| Standing amidst the shadows of swords and bows, Simhodara, extremely bewildered, was moving around like a man caught in a whirlpool. ||251|| Just as a herd of deer flees in all directions out of fear of a lion, so did Simhodara's army flee in all directions out of fear of him. ||252|| Those Samantas standing far away were saying to each other, "Take off your armor, drop your swords, throw away your bows." ||253||

Lakshmana acted like a lion towards the jackals. ||240||

The Thirty-Third Chapter

119. Release the bow, dismount the horse, leave the elephant behind, throw the mace into the pit, do not make a loud sound.  This extremely terrifying man might come upon us. ||254||

Seeing the group of weapons and hearing the sound, who is this man who has come upon us? ||255||

Move away from this place, give way, O warrior!  Remove the elephant from here, why are you standing still? ||256||

O wicked charioteer!  Look, he has arrived, he has arrived, abandon the chariot, hurry the horses, we are surely killed. ||257||

Thus speaking, many warriors, having fallen into distress, have abandoned their warrior garb and stand like eunuchs. ||257||

Is this some god playing in battle, or a Vidyadhara?  Or is this the power of some wind, known in the world? ||259||

Is this the same as the fierce Yama, the wind, who is known in the world?  Is this he, who is as swift and fickle as lightning? ||260||

Having destroyed this army, what will he do next?  O Lord, our minds are filled with doubt. ||261||

"Look, he is leaping into the battle, exciting the hair on our bodies.  He has dragged the terrified Singhodara from the elephant, and tied him with his own garment around his neck.  He is coming forward, subduing him like a bull, and is astonished." ||262-263||

Thus, upon hearing the words of his ministers, Vajrakarna said, "Be at ease, O men, the gods will bring peace.  What is the use of worrying so much?" ||264||

Standing on the tops of the palaces, the women of Dasanganagara, filled with wonder, said to each other, ||265||

"O friend, look at the extraordinary feat of this hero, who has single-handedly bound this king with his garment." ||266||

"How glorious is his radiance, how powerful is his brilliance, and how great is his strength!  Who is this excellent man?" ||267||

"Is he the husband of some fortunate and virtuous woman?  Or will he be in the future?  He is the lord of the entire earth." ||268||

Then, the queens of Singhodara, along with the old and the young, fell at the feet of Lakshmana, weeping and trembling with fear. ||269||

In the Padma Purana, the gods said, "Release him, and grant us the alms of a husband. From today, he is your obedient servant." ||270||
He said, "Look, this tall tree trunk is in front of you. I will take him there and hang him on it." ||271||
With great compassion, they again folded their hands and said, "If you are angry, O gods, kill us and release him." ||272||
"Be merciful, do not show us the sorrow of widowhood. Indeed, the best of men are compassionate towards women." ||273||
Saying, "I will release him in front of you, be well," he went to the temple where Rama was staying with Sita. ||274||
Lakshmana said, "This is the enemy of Vajrakarn. I have brought him here. Now, O god, command me what to do." ||275||
Then, with trembling limbs, Singhodara, with his hands folded and his head bowed, fell at the feet of Rama. ||276||
And he said, "O god, I do not know who you are. You are radiant, endowed with excellent brilliance, and as steady as Mount Meru." ||277||
"O great and noble man, whether you are a human or a god, what is the point of saying much? I am your obedient servant." ||278||
"If Vajrakarn is pleasing to you, let him take this kingdom. I will always serve your feet." ||279||
The wives of Singhodara, weeping with great compassion, bowed down at the feet of Rama and said, "Grant us the alms of a husband." ||280||
"O goddess, you are the embodiment of beauty, therefore, O beautiful one, be merciful to us." Saying this, they fell at the feet of Sita. ||281||
Then, Rama, who caused fear in the swans of the lakes with the sound of his thunderous voice, looked down at Singhodara and said, ||282||
"O wise one, do what Vajrakarn tells you. This is how you can live, there is no other way." ||283||
Then, Vajrakarn, whose fortune was increasing, was called by the well-wishers and came to the temple with his family. ||284||
He circumambulated the temple three times with his hands raised in reverence, praised the moon-god, and bowed down with devotion, his heart filled with joy. ||285||

**121**

Then, the virtuous one, approaching, praised the two brothers in turn. He inquired about Sita's health, being a knower of the Dharma. **286**

"May you be well, and we are well in all respects," said Rama, with a very sweet voice. **287**

While this conversation continued between them, the charmingly dressed Vidyunanga, with his army, arrived like lightning. **288**

He bowed to them, praised them, being a wise man in the order. He sat near the valiant Vajrakarn. **289**

"This wise Vidyunanga is a close friend of Vajrakarn," a loud voice arose in the assembly. **290**

Then Rama, with a smile on his face, said, "O Vajrakarn! Your vision is truly excellent. **291**

Your intellect is not shaken even by false doctrines, like the peak of Mount Meru by the winds of destruction. **292**

Even seeing me, your head did not bow. Oh, how beautiful and peaceful is your conduct! **293**

Or, what is difficult for a man who knows the pure truth? Especially for a man of righteous vision, devoted to Dharma. **294**

With what head can one bow to others, having bowed to the Jina, the supreme Lord, the binder of the three worlds, with a raised head? **295**

A bee, intoxicated by the taste of nectar, even in its madness, does not place itself on the tail of a donkey. **296**

You are wise, blessed, and close to attaining liberation. Your fame, whiter than the moon, wanders throughout the world. **297**

I know that this Vidyunanga is also your close friend. This one too is worthy, who is eager to serve you. **298**

Then, ashamed by the praise of his good qualities, and with his head slightly bowed, Vajrakarn said, "O Lord! Though you have suffered greatly while staying here..." **299**

"You are born a great soul, my dearest friend." **300**

122
In the Padma Purana, this rule of mine is now being followed due to your grace, and by my fortune, you, the best of men, have arrived here. ||301||
Hearing this, the wise Lakshmana said to Vajrakarna, "Whatever you desire, I will fulfill it quickly." ||302||
Vajrakarna, having obtained such a rare friend as you, said, "There is nothing rare in this world. Therefore, I pray that, being a follower of the Jina's teachings, I do not wish to cause harm even to a blade of grass. Therefore, let my lord, King Singhodara, be released." ||303-304||
Upon hearing this, the people exclaimed, "Praise be to him!" See, this noble man is holding a good mind even towards his enemy. ||305||
He who shows compassion to an offender is a true gentleman. And who does not feel love for a mediator or a benefactor? ||306||
Saying, "So be it," Lakshmana made a pact of friendship with both of them, shaking hands and swearing that they would never be enemies again. ||307||
Singhodara, with his pure mind, gave half of Ujjayini and all that he had taken during the devastation of the country to Vajrakarna. ||308||
He also divided his army, country, courtesans, and wealth equally in half. ||309||
By the grace of his devotion to the Jinas, the highly renowned Vidyudanga also obtained that courtesan, that jeweled earring, and the position of commander-in-chief. ||310||
Then Vajrakarna, after paying great homage to Rama and Lakshmana, quickly summoned his eight daughters. ||311||
Since his elder brother Rama was seen to be accompanied by a wife, he gave his daughters, adorned with fine ornaments and full of humility, to Lakshmana in marriage. ||312||
Besides these, King Singhodara and other kings also gave their most excellent daughters. In this way, Lakshmana received three hundred daughters in total. ||313||
Standing them all before him, Vajrakarna said to Lakshmana, along with Singhodara and the other kings, "O Lord, these are your wives." ||314||

## The Thirty-Third Chapter

123. Lakshmana then said, "I will not engage in conjugal union until I have won a place that cannot be conquered by my strength." ||315||

Padma replied, "We do not have a fixed abode anywhere. In this kingdom of Bharata, which is like heaven, we will cross all the lands and build our home near the Malaya mountain or the southern ocean. Then, driven by longing, either I or Lakshmana will surely return to Ayodhya. O kings, we will bring your daughters at that time. Tell me, how can one who has no fixed abode engage in conjugal union?" ||316-319||

Hearing this, the group of maidens, like a lotus grove struck by a frosty wind, became agitated and beautiful. ||320||

The maidens thought, "If we give up our lives in the separation from our husbands, how will we ever attain the elixir of union with them?" ||321||

"And if we continue to live, people will think we are deceitful, and our hearts will burn with the blazing fire of separation." ||322||

"Alas! On one side is a huge, steep cliff, and on the other, a most cruel tiger. With such extreme suffering, what support can we find?" ||323||

"Or perhaps, for now, we will subdue the tiger of separation with the knowledge of the desire for union and sustain our bodies." ||324||

Thinking thus, the maidens, along with the kings, departed as they had come, paying due respect to Rama and the others. ||325||

Those maidens, whose conduct was excellent, who were constantly honored by their fathers, and who were devoted to various pleasures, remained with their hearts fixed on Lakshmana. ||326||

Then, with great pomp and ceremony, the father, accompanied by his relatives, was brought back to his own country. Upon his arrival, a grand festival of reunion was held. ||327||

Then, in the dead of night, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, after bowing to the Lord, stealthily left the temple and walked away at their own pace. ||328||

When dawn broke, and the temple was found empty, all the people, forgetting their duties, were left with empty hearts. ||329||

1. Rama and others.
2. Empty-hearted.

Padma Purana
The supreme affection that arose between Vajrakarna and Singhodara was enhanced by mutual respect and frequent visits. ||330||

Mandakranta Vrittam
Gautama Swami says that Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, moving at their own pace, stayed in the midst of forests filled with vast lakes, drinking the desired juice of delicious fruits, and playing with excellent words and beautiful gestures, reached the country called Kuvera, which was beautiful with the high peaks of various types of buildings, whose earth was filled with pleasant gardens, which was sanctified by the group of temples, which was radiant like heaven, whose city dwellers were excellent due to continuous festivals, which was filled with the words of the noble, and which was radiant and famous like the sun. ||331-332||

Thus ends the thirty-third chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by Acharya Ravishena, known as the Arsha, which narrates the story of Vajrakarna. ||33||

1. Heaven-like. 2. Famous, B.

In the Padma Purana, there were various kinds of dishes, sugar candy, and modakas. There were also bowls full of ghee, and puris filled with jaggery. ||14|| There were clothes, ornaments, garlands, and various kinds of pastes. There were also various kinds of vessels and hand-washing utensils. ||15|| All this was brought by the nearby swift-footed men, and the king had it brought to his own place. ||16|| Then, following the king's instructions, the inner doorkeeper went to where Rama was seated with Sita, and bowing down, he spoke thus: ||17|| "O Lord, your brother is in that tent, and the king of this city is also there. He respectfully requests that since the tent is cool and shady, and pleasing to the mind, you should be pleased to go there willingly." ||18-19|| Upon hearing this, Rama, adorned with the splendor of a maddened elephant, went with Sita, like the moon with the moonlight. ||20|| Seeing Rama approaching from afar, the prince, along with Lakshmana, stood up and went to greet him. ||21|| Rama, accompanied by Sita, sat on a very fine seat, and received the honors bestowed by the prince, such as the offering of water. ||22|| Then, after completing all the desired activities like bathing and eating, the prince sent away all the other people. Only Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and the prince remained. ||23|| Saying, "A messenger has come from my father," the prince went to another room, which was elaborately decorated. There, he stationed many warriors, armed with various weapons, at the door, and gave the order that whoever entered there would be killed by him. ||24-25|| Then, overcoming the shyness he felt in revealing his true feelings, the prince tore open the curtain in front of Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. ||26|| As the curtain was removed, it seemed as if a beautiful maiden had descended from heaven, or emerged from the underworld. The maiden's face was slightly flushed with shyness. ||27|| Her radiance illuminated the palace, like a fire that has just been lit. Her face, with its shy smile, shone like the moon with its soft rays. ||28||

It is said in the Padma Purana by the lord of the earth, the lion-bellied one, that if a son is born to the queen, he will rule the kingdom. ||41||
Then, unfortunately, I was born, a daughter, but the wise minister Vasubuddhi, with the desire for the kingdom, informed Singhodara that a son had been born. ||42||
My mother, devoid of any meaning, named me Kalyanamala. It is common for people to engage in auspicious practices. ||43||
Only the minister and my mother know that I am a daughter, no one else. Today, by the grace of fortune, I have seen you all. ||44||
My father is in great distress, imprisoned and suffering. Even Singhodara is unable to free him. ||45||
Whatever wealth is produced in this land is sent to the Mlechchha king, who protects the fortresses. ||46||
My mother, consumed by the fire of separation, has become like the moon, devoid of radiance, reduced to a mere form. ||47||
Saying this, Kalyanamala, her entire body burdened with sorrow, lost her radiance and cried out with a choked voice. ||48||
Then, Rama comforted her with sweet words. Sita took her in her lap and wiped her tears. Lakshmana said, "Oh beautiful one, abandon your sorrow. Rule the kingdom in this very form, you are doing the right thing." ||49-50||
Oh auspicious one, oh Kalyanamala, wait patiently for a few days. What is it for me to capture the Mlechchha king? You will soon see your father freed. ||51||
Hearing this, she was filled with joy, as if her father had already been freed. Her entire body was filled with happiness and radiance. ||52||
Then, in that beautiful forest, they all spent three days, enjoying themselves like gods, engaging in various conversations. ||53||
Then, at night, when everyone was asleep, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita, left the forest, seeking shelter in a cave. ||54||

529. Seeing them gone, the princess was distraught, her mind filled with anxiety. She cried out in despair, overcome by the deepest sorrow. 55. "Oh, great men," she thought, "have you stolen my heart and left me asleep? How cruel you are to leave me!" 56. With great effort, she suppressed her grief and mounted her noble elephant. She entered the city of Kubera, dwelling there with a heart filled with sorrow, as before. 57. Then, guided by the auspicious garland, their hearts purified by her grace, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana reached the banks of the Narmada River. 58. Crossing the river, enjoying their playful journey, they traversed many beautiful lands and reached the great forest of Vindhya. 59. They traveled along a path carved by the passage of a massive army, and were stopped by herdsmen and plowmen who warned them not to proceed further. 60. This forest, filled with a heavy fragrance, was adorned with trees like teak, embraced by vines, making it as beautiful as the garden of Nandana. In other places, the forest was scarred by fire, with scorched trees near the edges, making it appear as ugly as a lineage tainted by a wicked son. 61-62. As they continued, Sita said, "Look, in the midst of the Karanja forest, a crow sits on the top of a thorny tree on the left, cawing repeatedly. He is saying, 'There will be a battle soon.' And over there, another crow sits on a milk-tree, announcing, 'We will be victorious.'" 63-64. "Therefore, let us wait for a moment, for I do not find the prospect of victory after a battle very pleasing." 65. After a brief delay, they continued their journey, but the same omen appeared again nearby. 66. Despite Sita's warnings, Rama and Lakshmana continued on their way. They encountered an army of Mlechchas, but upon seeing the fearless Rama and Lakshmana, armed with their excellent bows, the army fled in terror within a moment. 67.

Padma Purana
Having understood this, the other Mlechchas came together. But they were also defeated by Lakshmana, who was like a rain cloud, with laughter. ||65|| Then those Mlechchas, extremely terrified, with their bows fallen, making a great noise, went and informed their lord. ||70|| Then he, filled with extreme anger, took up his terrible bow and came out, with a great army, covered in the darkness of weapons. ||71|| Those Mlechchas were known on earth as Kakonada, extremely fierce, eaters of all flesh, and invincible even by kings. ||72|| Seeing the direction covered by them, like a cloud, in front of him, Lakshmana, the bearer of fortune, angrily strung his bow. ||73|| And thus he shook it so that the whole forest trembled, and a fever arose in the wild animals, causing them to tremble. ||74|| Seeing Lakshmana stringing his arrow, those Mlechchas, with terrified minds, began to spin around like blind men. ||75|| Then the lord of the Mlechchas, filled with fear, got down from his chariot, folded his hands, and bowed down. ||76|| There is a famous city called Kaushambi, whose lord is a pure Brahmin named Vishvanala, who constantly performs Agnihotra. ||77|| I am the son of him and his wife, PratiSandhya, known as RaudraBhooti, skilled in the arts of weapons and gambling. ||78|| From childhood, I was always skilled in evil deeds. Once, I was caught for theft and was about to be impaled on a stake. ||79|| Hearing the name of the stake, my body trembled, but a wealthy, righteous man, trusting me, bailed me out. Then I left the country and came here. ||80|| By the influence of my karma, I have become the lord of these Kakonada Mlechchas, and I live here, corrupted from virtue, like an animal. ||81|| For so long, even kings with large armies were unable to see me, but you, O best of men, have seen me. I am blessed to have been seen by you. ||83||

131. O Lord, what should I do that is fitting? Should I carry your holy sandals on my head? ||4||
"This Vindhya mountain is full of treasures and hundreds of beautiful women. O Gods, please tell me what burden or revenue you desire from me." ||85||
Saying this, he bowed down and then fell into great distress, like a tree uprooted from the ground. ||86||
Seeing him in such a state of distress, Raghava, who was like a great tree embracing compassion, spoke to the Mlechchha king. ||88||
"Rise, rise, do not fear. Release Balikhilya from his bonds and bring him here quickly, having bestowed upon him the highest honor." ||87-88||
He became the king's favorite minister, associating with noble people and abandoning the company of the Mlechchhas, becoming a benefactor of the country. ||89||
"If you do all this properly, then you will find peace. Otherwise, you will be killed today." ||90||
"O Lord, I will do as you say," he said, bowing respectfully to Rama and then, with humility, went to release Balikhilya, the son of the great chariot warrior. ||91||
After Balikhilya was anointed with oil, bathed well, and adorned with ornaments, he was placed on a chariot and the king set out to take him to Rama. ||92||
As he was being taken, Balikhilya was filled with great wonder, thinking to himself, "My situation will probably be even worse than this." ||93||
"How can this cruel Mlechchha, who is a great enemy and a doer of evil deeds, be so respectful? I don't think I will survive today." ||94||
Balikhilya was going along, his heart filled with sorrow, when he suddenly saw Rama and Lakshmana. He was overjoyed and, getting down from the chariot, bowed down and said, "O Lords, you have come here, adorned with such beautiful forms, because of my good fortune. It is because of you that I have been freed from my bonds." ||95-96||
Rama and Lakshmana said to him, "Go quickly to your own home and enjoy the company of your loved ones. You will know us there." ||97||
Balikhilya, filled with joy, went to his home. ||97||
Seeing them, the poor man was overwhelmed with joy. I am blessed to have seen such great souls among men. ||82-83||
O Lord, please tell me what service I can do that is fitting. Should I carry your holy sandals on my head? ||84||
This Vindhya mountain is full of treasures and hundreds of beautiful women. O Gods, please tell me what burden or revenue you desire from me. ||85||

It is because of you that I have been freed from my bonds." ||95-96||
Rama and Lakshmana said to him, "Go quickly to your own home and enjoy the company of your loved ones. You will know us there." ||97||
Balikhilya, filled with joy, went to his home. ||97||
Seeing them, the poor man was overwhelmed with joy. I am blessed to have seen such great souls among men. ||82-83||
O Lord, please tell me what service I can do that is fitting. Should I carry your holy sandals on my head? ||84||
This Vindhya mountain is full of treasures and hundreds of beautiful women. O Gods, please tell me what burden or revenue you desire from me. ||85||
Saying this, he bowed down and then fell into great distress, like a tree uprooted from the ground. ||86||
Seeing him in such a state of distress, Raghava, who was like a great tree embracing compassion, spoke to the Mlechchha king. ||88||
"Rise, rise, do not fear. Release Balikhilya from his bonds and bring him here quickly, having bestowed upon him the highest honor." ||87-88||
He became the king's favorite minister, associating with noble people and abandoning the company of the Mlechchhas, becoming a benefactor of the country. ||89||
"If you do all this properly, then you will find peace. Otherwise, you will be killed today." ||90||
"O Lord, I will do as you say," he said, bowing respectfully to Rama and then, with humility, went to release Balikhilya, the son of the great chariot warrior. ||91||
After Balikhilya was anointed with oil, bathed well, and adorned with ornaments, he was placed on a chariot and the king set out to take him to Rama. ||92||
As he was being taken, Balikhilya was filled with great wonder, thinking to himself, "My situation will probably be even worse than this." ||93||
"How can this cruel Mlechchha, who is a great enemy and a doer of evil deeds, be so respectful? I don't think I will survive today." ||94||
Balikhilya was going along, his heart filled with sorrow, when he suddenly saw Rama and Lakshmana.

## The Padmacharita, Chapter 34: The Tale of Valikhilya

**532**

Having made his servant, the son of Vishvanala, very happy, he (Valikhilya) set out with Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, who were accompanied by cold (i.e., in the winter). ||18||

Valikhilya, accompanied by the mighty Raudrabhuti, reached the land near his own city, remembering the deeds of his relatives. ||99||

Then, having made his father very happy with his great power, Kalyanamalini, his daughter, came out of the city to welcome him. ||100||

Having recognized his daughter, who had come to greet him, the king Valikhilya smelled her head and then, having mounted his chariot, entered the city of Kubera. ||101||

The queen of the earth, Prithvi, was filled with joy and her body trembled with excitement. In an instant, she regained her old form, which was like a sea of light. ||102||

Singhodara and all the other kings were filled with wonder at the virtues of Kalyanamalini. ||103||

The wealth that Raudrabhuti had accumulated over a long time, having been devoted to theft and plundering various countries, entered the house of Valikhilya. ||104||

When Raudrabhuti, who had subdued the impregnable land of the Mlechchas, became obedient to Valikhilya, Singhodara, who had been filled with fear, also became very affectionate towards him, showing him respect and honor. ||105||

Thus, the great warrior Valikhilya, by the grace of Rama and Lakshmana, attained supreme power and was adorned by his beloved, just as the sun is adorned by the autumn season. ||106||

Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by the sage Ravishena, which narrates the tale of Valikhilya. ||34||

The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

Then those three, who were as radiant as the gods, while enjoying themselves in a beautiful forest like the Nandana forest, reached a very bright country. ||1|| In the middle of which a famous river, known as the Tapi, flows, resounding with the sounds of various birds. ||2|| In that forest, devoid of water, Sita, exhausted, said to Rama, "O Lord! My throat is completely dry. ||3|| Just as one who has been afflicted by hundreds of births desires to see the glorious Lord, similarly, I, tormented by intense thirst, desire water." ||4|| Having said this, even though she was being stopped, she sat down under a good tree. Rama said, "O Devi! O auspicious one! Do not be afflicted." ||5|| "This large village, full of magnificent mansions, is visible nearby. Get up, let us go there quickly, we will drink cool water there." ||6|| Having said this, they both, along with Sita, who was walking slowly, reached the Arun village, where many wealthy families lived. ||7|| There lived a Brahmin named Kapila, who performed Agnihotra daily. They both reached his house and entered it in due order. ||8|| There, in the Agnihotra hall, they rested for a moment, and Sita drank the cool water given to her by the Brahmin's wife. ||9|| While they were staying there, a Brahmin came back from the forest, carrying a load of Bilva, Asvattha, and Palasha wood. ||10|| The mind of that Brahmin, who was always angry, was like a blazing fire, his words were like poison, and his face was like an owl's. ||11|| He was carrying a Kamandalu in his hand, he had a large tuft of hair on his head, he had grown a long beard, and he was wearing the Yajnopavita thread on his shoulder. With all these things, he was wearing a very crooked attire and was making a living by means of low practices. ||12|| Seeing them, he became very angry, his face became very crooked with frowns, and he spoke to the Brahmin's wife in such a way as if he were peeling her with sharp words. ||13||

## Chapter Thirty-Five

Having said this, Rama freed him and, placing Lakshmana in front, he departed from the hermitage with Sita. ||29|| 

"Fie! Fie! upon the association of the low, the cause of hearing harsh words, the creator of mental disturbances, and the one whom great men avoid." ||30||

"It is better to dwell in a cold, inaccessible forest under a tree, to abandon all possessions and wander the world, and to abandon food and die happily, than to stay even for a moment in the house of one who despises you." ||31-32||

"We will dwell on the banks of rivers and in the most beautiful caves of mountains, but we will never again enter the house of the wicked." ||33||

Thus condemning the association of the wicked and bearing great pride, Rama left the village and took the path of the forest. ||34||

Then came the rainy season, turning the entire sky blue and echoing through the caves with the sound of thunder. ||35||

The sky seemed to laugh, hiding the constellations and the celestial bodies behind a curtain of lightning. ||36||

The clouds roared, driving away the fierce heat of summer, and seemed to threaten the travelers with their lightning fingers. ||37||

The dark clouds, filled with rain, prepared to shower Sita with water, just as an elephant prepares to shower Lakshmi. ||38||

Then they reached a nearby, vast banyan tree, whose trunk was as secure as a house and whose branches were very high. ||39||

Then, overwhelmed by their brilliance, a Yaksha named Ibhakarn went to his master, who lived in the Vindhya forest, and bowing down, said, "O Master! Three great men have come from heaven and stayed in my house, who have overwhelmed me with their brilliance and driven me out of my house quickly." ||40-41||

Hearing Ibhakarn's words, the Yaksha king smiled and, with his wives, set out to go to the banyan tree, playfully. ||42||

Padma Purana
He was the lord of the Yakshas, adorned with great splendor, and was playing in the delightful forest, known as 'Putana'. ||43|| Seeing them from afar, the great-formed lord of the Yakshas, using his knowledge of the future, recognized them as Balabhadra and Narayana. ||44|| Then, by his influence and great affection, he created a beautiful city for them in an instant. ||45|| Then, they slept there in comfort, and were awakened by the sound of very beautiful music in the morning. ||46|| They saw themselves lying on a bed adorned with jewels, a magnificent palace with many floors, shining brightly, a group of servants eagerly engaged in serving their bodies, and a city adorned with great sounds, ramparts, and gateways. ||47-48|| It is right that their minds did not experience wonder at the sight of this city, for these great souls, seeing this city, did not experience wonder, for this was a trivial feat. ||49|| Adorned with beautiful actions, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, endowed with all things, lived happily in that city, enjoying pleasures like the gods. ||50|| Since that city was created by the Yaksha king for Rama, it became known as Rampuri on earth. ||51|| Gatekeepers, soldiers, brave warriors, ministers, horses, elephants, and various types of townspeople were in Rampuri, just as they were in Ayodhya. ||52|| Then, King Shrenik asked Gautama Swami, "O Lord! What happened to that Kapila Brahmin who behaved in such a way with Rama and Lakshmana? Tell me." ||53|| Then Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! Listen, that Brahmin got up at dawn, took a sickle in his hand, and went towards the forest. ||54|| He was wandering here and there to obtain fuel, etc., when he suddenly raised his eyes and saw a vast city. His face was filled with wonder at the sight. ||55|| That city was adorned with many flags of white and other colors, and with extremely radiant buildings like the clouds of the autumn season. ||56|| In the middle of the city, there was a large building with a white lotus-shaped umbrella, which seemed like the abode of Kailasa. ||57||

The Twenty-Fifth Chapter

137.  The Brahmin thought, "Is this heaven? Or is it the same forest, inhabited by deer, where I used to wander, constantly suffering, in search of fuel and kusha grass?" ||54||

Suddenly, the city appeared, adorned with lofty mountain peaks, and resplendent with buildings resembling mountains of jewels. ||59||

Here, I see beautiful lakes, covered with lotuses, which I have never seen before. ||60||

I see delightful gardens, tended by people, and temples marked by large flags, like the abodes of gods. ||61||

The land surrounding this city is crowded with elephants, horses, cows, and buffaloes, and filled with the sounds of bells and other instruments. ||62||

Has this city descended from heaven? Or has it emerged from the underworld, due to the influence of some virtuous soul? ||63||

Am I dreaming? Or is this some kind of illusion? Or is this the city of the Gandharvas? Or am I delirious with fever? ||64||

Or is this an omen of my imminent death? Thinking thus, the Brahmin was overcome with great doubt. ||65||

At that moment, he saw a woman adorned with various ornaments. Approaching her, he asked, "O lady, whose city is this?" ||66||

She replied, "This is the city of Rama. Have you never heard of Rama, whose brother is Lakshmana, and whose beloved is Sita?" ||67||

"O Brahmin, you see that large building in the middle of the city, shining like the autumn moon. It is there that the Supreme Lord resides." ||68||

"His sight is extremely rare. This Supreme Lord has made all poor people like kings, by giving them whatever they desire." ||69||

The Brahmin said, "O beautiful one, by what means can I see Rama? I am asking you with good intentions, so you should be able to tell me." ||70||

Saying this, the Brahmin placed his load of fuel on the ground, and with folded hands, fell at the woman's feet. It is no wonder, for who could resist her charm? ||71||

1. Upalingam: In the commentary, it is noted that Upalingam means an omen of death.
2. Ati-daridra: Extremely poor.

Padma Purana
Then, that compassionate Yakshini named Sumaya spoke to the Brahmin, saying, "You have done a great act of daring." ||72|| How did you come near this city? If the fierce guards had seen you, you would surely have perished. ||73|| Even the gods find it difficult to enter the three gates of this city, for they are always guarded by fierce protectors, with faces like lions, elephants, and tigers, who are strong, valiant, and have strict control. Those who are frightened by these guards undoubtedly meet death. ||74-75|| Besides these, you see that eastern gate and the white buildings nearby, which are as radiant as the wings of a heron, adorned with jeweled arches and rows of various flags. These are the Jain temples where the Arhats, worthy of worship by the Indras, are enshrined. The man who performs Samayika and recites the praise of these Arhats with devotion, saying, "Namo Arhat Siddha Nisvanama," i.e., "Salutations to the Arhats and the Siddhas," and who, guided by the teachings of his Guru, has attained right faith, is the one who enters that eastern gate. On the other hand, the one who does not bow down to the images is killed. ||76-79|| The one who is a follower of the Anuvrata and adorned with good qualities and character, is pleased by Rama with the desired object. ||80|| 
Hearing her words, which were like nectar, the Brahmin was filled with great joy, having found a way to gain wealth. ||81|| He bowed to her, praised her repeatedly, and his whole body trembled with excitement, his heart filled with wonder. ||82|| He went to the Muni, who was a hero in the practice of his vows, bowed down with folded hands, and asked him about the practices of those who follow the Anuvrata. ||83|| Then, the wise Brahmin, instructed by the Muni, accepted the householder's dharma and listened to the nature of the Anuyogas. ||84|| At first, he was driven by greed for wealth and wanted to listen to dharma, but now he had attained the desire to embrace true dharma. ||85|| Having understood dharma from the Muni, the Brahmin said with a happy heart, "Master, your teachings have opened my eyes today." ||86||

139. Just as a thirsty man finds water, a man seeking shelter finds shade, a hungry man finds delicious food, a sick man finds good medicine, a man lost on a bad path finds the way to his desired destination, and a man drowning in the sea finds a boat, in the same way, I have obtained this Jain Dharma, which destroys all suffering, by your grace. This Jain Dharma is extremely rare for low-born men. 87-89. Since you have shown me this path, which is taught by the Jinas, there is no one in the three worlds who is as beneficial to me as you. 90. Saying this, the twice-born man bowed his head at the feet of the Muni with folded hands, circumambulated him, and went home. 91. Then, with eyes like blooming lotuses and filled with great joy, he said to his wife, "My dear, I have heard something extraordinary from the Guru today." 92. "Such an extraordinary thing that neither your father, nor your grandfather, nor anyone in your lineage has heard it, even after much telling." 93. "O Brahmani, the wonderful thing I saw in the forest, which I was amazed by, is no longer a cause for wonder after the Guru's teachings." 94. The Brahmani said, "O Brahman, tell me what you saw and what you heard." The Brahman said, "My dear, I am unable to speak due to joy." 95. Then, filled with curiosity, the Brahmani asked again and again with respect. The twice-born man said, "O Arya, listen to the wonder I heard." 96. "I went to the forest to gather firewood, and near it, where there was a dense forest, I saw a beautiful city." 97. "Near that city, I saw a woman adorned with ornaments. It seems she must be some goddess who speaks charmingly." 98. "I asked her, and she said that this is the city of Rampura, where King Ramachandra gives a large forest to the Shravakas." 99.

## Padma Purana, Chapter I

100. Having gone there, I heard the words of the Sadhu, the Jina. My soul, tormented by wrong views, was greatly comforted by them.

101. Wise ones, desiring the embrace of liberation, practice austerities, relying on this Dharma, having renounced all possessions.

102. I have obtained this Dharma, the great treasure of the three worlds. Those who are external to it, the other-speakers, suffer in vain.

103. The Dharma of the Muni, as it truly is, was heard by me, and I, with a pure mind, explained it to the Brahmani.

104. "See, my fate! I, who desired the fruits of poison due to delusion, have obtained the nectar of the name and form of the Arhant, even though I had no desire for it."

105. Just as a fool, having a gem in his hand, throws it away, so I, a fool, had the Sadhu in my courtyard and insulted him.

106. On that day, at the time of food, the Digambar Muni, weary from fasting, came to my house. I rejected him and looked for another Sadhu.

107. I disregarded the Arhant, whom even Indra worships, and bowed my head to the astrologers and other gods.

108. The Dharma of the Arhant, the nectar of Dharma, is pure and essential, free from violence. Due to ignorance, I have consumed the poison of wrong conduct, rejecting it.

109. Having reached the human world, I have abandoned the Dharma-jewel, tested by the Sadhus, and embraced the thorny path of attachment. What a pity!

110. I have given offerings to those who are attached to the objects of the senses, who eat as they please, day and night, who are without vows, and who are devoid of good conduct. All this has been in vain.

111. The person who, at the time of food, does not honor a guest who has arrived, according to his ability, does not give him food, etc., has no Dharma.

112. The Sadhu who has renounced festivals and occasions, who is completely free from all possessions, and who is without a home, is called a guest.

113. Those who have no food in their hands, and no possessions near them, are free from attachments, and they deliver others, those who eat from their hands and bowls.

140. They give wealth.

---------------------------
## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

**141**

Those who are detached even in their own bodies and who are never tempted by external objects, should be known as **nirgrantha** (free from attachments), adorned with the marks of liberation. || 115 ||

Thus, with the emergence of right faith and free from the dirt of wrong faith, Susharma, like the star Budha in the constellation Bharani, shone brightly with her husband. || 116 ||

Then, taking her to the feet of her Guru with great reverence, the Brahmin woman received the **Anuvrata** (minor vows) from him. || 117 ||

Knowing that Kapil was devoted to the **Jina** (Jain) teachings, the families of the Brahmins, who were once fierce like poisonous snakes, attained peace. || 118 ||

Having attained the firm faith of Muni Suvrata Nath, those who were wise became **Shravakas** (lay followers) and said: || 119 ||

We were burdened by the weight of our karmas, our heads were held high with pride, and we were constantly indulging in negligence. But now, by the grace of the **Jina** dharma, we will not go to the terrible hell. || 120-121 ||

We did not know this, nor did we attain it in hundreds of births. But today, we have attained this extremely pure **Jina** dharma, which is like Brahma, with great difficulty. || 121 ||

With minds filled with the desire for meditation, we, the **Man-Rishi** (spiritual seekers), are now offering our **karma** (actions) as fuel, with the ghee of our emotions, into the blazing fire of meditation. || 122 ||

Thus, with their minds fixed and filled with emotion, many Brahmins became **Shramanas** (ascetics), detached from all attachments. || 123 ||

But Kapil, devoted to the **Sagar** (ocean) dharma, was a man of excellent conduct. One day, he said to the Brahmin woman with good intentions: || 124 ||

My dear, why don't we go to Rampuri today, to see the extremely powerful, pure-minded, and lotus-eyed **Rama**? || 125 ||

He is always devoted to hope, his mind is always engaged in finding ways to earn wealth, he is immersed in the ocean of poverty, and even filling his stomach is difficult for him. Yet, he rescues the poor people. Such is his fame, pure and joyful. || 126-127 ||

Get up, my dear, and take this basket of flowers. I will carry this delicate child on my shoulder. || 128 ||

**Note:** The terms in bold are Jain terms.

142
Having said this and done so, the couple, filled with joy, were ready to go. They were adorned with pure garments, according to their strength. ||129|| As they went, fierce serpents stood in their path, their hoods raised, and Vetalas with terrible faces and loud laughter blocked their way. ||130|| Seeing all these terrifying things, their hearts remained unmoved. With unwavering minds, they began to recite this praise: ||131|| "Salutations to the Jinas, who are worthy of worship by the three worlds, who have crossed the terrible ocean of existence, and who bestow the supreme bliss. ||132|| Knowing the devotion of the couple, the Yakshas were pacified and they reached the Jinalaya in Rampuri. ||133|| Then, saying "Salutations to the abode of the Lord," they joined their hands and, after circumambulating, they began to recite this praise: ||134|| "O Lord! We have come to your refuge after a long time, abandoning the worldly path that brings suffering and misery. ||135|| We bow to the twenty-four Tirthankaras, both Utsarpini and Avasarpini, past, present, and future. ||136|| We bow to the five Tirthankaras of the Bharata Kshetra and the five of the Airavata Kshetra, those who have been, are, and will be. ||137|| We bow to the Tirthankaras of all the realms, past, present, and future, who have crossed the ocean of existence themselves and have helped others to cross it. ||138|| Salutations to Muni-Suvrata, the Lord, whose pure and radiant teachings illuminate the three worlds. ||139|| Reciting this praise, they touched the ground with their knees and foreheads, and their bodies trembled with devotion. ||140|| Then, having completed their duty of worship, the peaceful and gentle Rakshasas gave permission to the Brahmin Kapila, along with his family, to go and see Rama. ||141|| He went along the royal road, past mountains like palaces, shining with pure brilliance, and filled with divine women. ||142||

The Twenty-Fifth Chapter
143. The city of that one, adorned with buildings resembling the heavens, shines with all the qualities of desire, like the white Kunda flower. ||13||
144. O Bhadra, this is his abode, surrounded by magnificent palaces, and it stands in the midst of the city of the charming Rama. ||144||
145. Saying this, the greatly delighted one entered that house. Seeing Lakshmana from afar, he was overwhelmed with anxiety. ||145||
146. Trembling, he thought, "This one, resembling the indigo lotus, is the same one who tormented me, a foolish one, with various kinds of death at that time." ||146||
147. Greatly distressed, he spoke these words in his ears, "O great villain! O sinner! At that time, you spoke words that were extremely painful to the ears. Why are you silent now? Come out!" ||147||
148. He thought to himself, "What should I do? Where should I go? What hole should I enter? Who will be a refuge for me, this helpless one, today?" ||148||
149. "If I had known that he was staying here, I would have crossed the northern direction and abandoned this country." ||149||
150. Overwhelmed with anxiety, the Brahmin, leaving his wife, was about to flee when Lakshmana saw him. ||150||
151. Smiling, he said, "Where has this Brahmin come from? It seems he has been nurtured in the forest. Why is he so anxious?" ||151||
152. "Comfort him and bring him quickly. Let us see what he is doing and what he says." ||152||
153. "Do not be afraid, do not be afraid, return," he was urged. Having received comfort, he returned with faltering steps. ||153||
154. Approaching and leaving his wife behind, he spread out his white garment. Standing before them with a handful of flowers, he uttered the word "Svasti." ||154||
155. Then, seated on the seat that was given to him, with his wife sitting nearby, the Brahmin, skilled in hymns of praise, began to praise Rama and Lakshmana. ||155||
156. Then, Padma said, "Having made us experience such humiliation, why are you now worshipping us, O Brahmin? Tell us now that you have come." ||156||
157. He said, "I did not know that you were the disguised Maheshvara. Due to my delusion, I insulted you, like the wind covered in ashes." ||157|| 

Page #162:
---------------------------
The Puranas state that in the world of Jagannath, both the stationary and the mobile are revered. Just as the sun is worshipped during the winter solstice, the wealthy are always honored. (15)

Now I know that you are the same, not someone else. But here, wealth is worshipped, not you, O Padma! (159)

O Dev! People always respect the wealthy, and they abandon those who are poor, whose friendship has lost its purpose. (160)

Those who have wealth have friends, those who have wealth have relatives, those who have wealth are men in the world, and those who have wealth are wise. (161)

A man without wealth has no friend, no brother. But the same man, with wealth, becomes a relative to others. (162)

Wealth is that which is combined with Dharma, Dharma is that which is combined with compassion, and pure compassion is that which does not consume meat. (163)

Those who abstain from eating meat, all living beings, are praised for their renunciation, as it is rooted in other virtues. (164)

O King! This human world is strange, no one knows people like me. (165)

Let it be, you are worshipped by those like me. Even the virtuous suffer defeat from fools. (166)

Do you not know that there was once a Sanatkumara, a Chakravarti, whose form was seen by the gods who possessed great powers? But he too attained liberation by becoming a muni. Skilled in the knowledge of the scriptures, the muni wandered, but he did not receive alms anywhere. (167-168)

Then, in the city of Vijayapur, a woman who lived on the produce of trees, satisfied him with food and he attained the fivefold glory of wealth. (169)

Subhumi, whose arms were adorned with armlets, became a Chakravarti and extended his hand, adorned with rings, for alms. But no one gave him even a single grain, knowing that he was poor. So it is right. (170)

## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

This one, or any other, is helpless by people who enjoy their own deeds. He who is not understood there, is not considered a person there. ||172|| Why was the hospitality not done by me, the unfortunate one? Even today, my mind is burning with this thought. ||173|| Seeing your spotless, beautiful form, who, even if very angry, does not experience great wonder? ||174|| Saying this, the pure Kapil, weeping, was consoled by Rama with auspicious words, and Janaki consoled his wife, Susharma. ||175|| Then, by Rama's command, the servants bathed Kapil, the Shravaka, with joy, with water from golden pitchers, along with his wife. ||176|| He was given the best food, adorned with clothes and jewels, and taking a lot of wealth, he went to his own abode. ||177|| Although he had attained enjoyment, full of all kinds of equipment, which was amazing for people, still, he was pierced by arrows of honor, bitten by great serpents of virtue, and his soul was oppressed by service, so he did not attain satisfaction. Meaning - Rama had honored him instead of rejecting him, subdued him with his many virtues, and made him happy with service like bathing, eating, drinking, etc., so he was constantly in this sorrow, thinking, "Look, how I was a wicked person who did not even let them stay at home for one night, and how these great men have done such a favor to us?" ||178-179|| He began to think, "I was so poor in the village that I used to wander around with a bundle of wood on my shoulder, hungry and thirsty, with a weak body. Today, by Rama's grace, I have become like a Yaksha king in the same village, and I am free from all worries and sorrows." ||180-181|| "My house, which had collapsed, was dilapidated, full of holes, stained with the filth of crows and other birds, and where even cow dung was not applied, is now, by Rama's grace, full of many cows, surrounded by many palaces, and enclosed by a wall." ||182-183|| Alas, my lotus-eyed brothers have come home. They are created without fault, with faces like the moon. ||184|| 

Page #164:
---------------------------
146
It is a matter of regret that I, without any fault, disregarded those two brothers who had come home, who had eyes like lotuses and faces like the moon. ||184||  The two brothers, whose bodies were scorched by the heat of summer, went out of the house with the goddess, i.e., Sita. That thought always remains in my heart like a thorn, constantly moving. ||185||  Doubtless, my sorrow will not end until I leave home and take the nirarambha initiation. ||186||  After that, hearing the news of Kapil's dispassion, the frightened and humble Susharma, along with the Brahmin woman, began to shed tears. ||187||  Kapil, eager to attain liberation, seeing his family immersed in the ocean of sorrow, spoke with a detached mind, saying, "O people! This creature, infatuated by the strange affection of family members, who are full of great desires, burns constantly. Don't you know this?" ||188-189||  Thus, moved by emotion, Kapil, the Brahmin, left behind the woman who had fainted from sorrow and his relatives who were experiencing great sorrow. He gave eighteen thousand white cows, a house filled with jewels, and servants and maids, along with his son and all his wealth, to Susharma, the Brahmin woman, and became a nirarambha, digambara sage. ||190-192||  The extremely ascetic muni, a disciple of Sahyanandamati, a great ocean of virtues and character, became his guru, i.e., he took initiation from him. ||193||  After that, the great ascetic Kapil, who wore the pure garland of character, whose mind was always engaged in the ultimate truth, and whose body was embraced by the wealth of the nirgrantha vow, began to wander the earth. ||194||  Gautama Swami says that the person who, free from ego, reads or hears this story of Kapil, becomes radiant like the sun and obtains the fruit of a thousand fasts. ||195||  Thus ends the thirty-fifth chapter, named the Kapilopkhyana, in the Padmacharita, composed by Ravishena, the Acharya, known as the Arsha. ||34||

## Thirty-sixth Chapter

Then, as time passed, resembling a time of calamity, with a terrible darkness enveloped and lightning flashing fearfully, [1] in the auspicious, delightful, and joy-filled autumn season, [2] the Lord of the Yakshas, with a mind set on departure, said to Padma, "O Dev, please forgive any wrong done by us, for who is capable of doing what is fitting for those like you?" [3]  Ramadeva, in turn, addressed the Lord of the Guhyakas, saying, "You too, forgive all your dependence on me, [4] for you had to act according to my wishes for so long." [5]  The Lord of the Yakshas, filled with utmost joy at these words, bowed down and, after much praise, presented Padma with a wondrous garland called "Self-Luminous." [6]  He gave Lakshmana two ear-rings, shining like the rising sun, made of gems, and Sita a magnificent, auspicious, and dazzling crown, as well as a vina, capable of producing any desired sound and providing great entertainment. [7]  When they departed at their own will, the Yaksha King, filled with a little sorrow, withdrew the illusion of his city. [8]  Balarama, too, was delighted with the performance of his duty, thinking that he had attained the highest liberation. [9]  Roaming freely across the land, enjoying various delicious fruits, engaged in fascinating stories, and reveling like the gods, the three crossed a great forest teeming with elephants and lions, and reached the plain near the city of Vaijayanta, served by humans. [10-11]  Then, as the sun set, the group of directions was enveloped in darkness, and the courtyard of the sky was filled with the cluster of stars, they stayed in a desired place near the city, in the northwest direction, which inspires fear in ordinary humans. [12-13]  Now, in this city, there was a famous king, the upholder of the earth, and his queen, Indrani, possessed of all the virtues of womanhood. [14]

## Chapter 148 of the Padma Purana

148
Padma Purana
The king, known as Prithvi Dhar, had a queen named Indrani, who possessed all the virtues befitting a woman. ||14|| They had a daughter named Vanamala, who was extremely beautiful. From her childhood, she was enamored by the virtues of Lakshmana. ||15|| Upon hearing that Rama, along with Lakshmana, had gone somewhere to fulfill the promise made to his father Dasharatha at the time of his initiation, her parents decided to give Vanamala in marriage to the son of the king of Indra Nagar, a very eligible and handsome young man named Balamitra. ||16-17|| When Vanamala, whose heart held Lakshmana, heard this news, she was filled with fear of separation and began to worry. ||18|| She thought, "I would rather hang myself from a tree, with my clothes wrapped around my neck, and die, than be united with another man." ||19|| "I will go to the forest under some pretext at the end of the day and die there, free from any obstacles." ||20|| "Oh, Lord Sun! Please go away and send the night quickly. I am utterly helpless and fall at your feet, with folded hands. Go and tell the night that this sorrowful woman, who yearns for her beloved, considers each day as long as a year, so please come quickly." ||21-22|| Thus, after making this resolve, the young girl, who had been fasting, received permission from her parents after the sun had set. She then boarded a magnificent chariot, surrounded by her friends, and went to worship the goddess of the forest. ||23-24|| By the will of fate, she arrived at the same place and on the same night where Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana had already settled. ||25|| There, she performed the worship of the forest deity. Afterwards, when everyone had completed their tasks and were sleeping peacefully, Vanamala, whose footsteps made no sound, left the camp like a deer in the forest and went ahead without fear. ||26-27|| Then, Lakshmana, filled with joy, smelled the extremely fragrant scent emanating from Vanamala's body and thought, ||28|| "Here, I see a form like a ray of light. Perhaps it is some noble girl of a good family, destined for great things." ||29|| 

Page #167:
---------------------------
The thirty-sixth chapter is filled with great sorrow.  The mind is afflicted, unable to see any way to alleviate the suffering. ||30||  She is surely planning to kill herself because of the unfulfilled desire.  I see her intention, hidden as it is. ||31||  Thinking this, Lakshmana became silent and stood beneath the banyan tree, like a god standing beneath the Kalpa tree. ||32||  Then, Vanamala, whose gait was like that of a swan, whose breasts were heavy, whose face was like the moon, and whose belly was thin, reached the same tree. ||33||  Seeing her in this state, Lakshmana thought, "I will find out from her words what her purpose is." ||34||  Then, making a noose from a cloth the color of water, the girl, whose words could captivate even yogis, spoke thus: "Oh, divine beings who dwell in this tree, hear me. I bow to you, may you be pleased with me. ||35-36||  Please tell Kumar Lakshmana, who is surely wandering in this forest, on my behalf, ||37||  that in your absence, the maiden Vanamala, filled with great sorrow, has gone to the realm of death, having set her heart on you. ||38||  We saw her, with a thin body, hanging from the banyan tree with a cloth, giving up her life for you. ||39||  And she said, 'Oh, my lord, though you did not come to me in this life, you are worthy of my devotion in another life.' ||40||  As she was about to tie the noose to the branch, Lakshmana, filled with anxiety, embraced her and said, "Oh, foolish one, this neck is worthy of my embrace. Why are you adorning it with this cloth noose, oh beautiful one? ||41-42||  I am Lakshmana, oh most beautiful one, release this noose. If you don't believe me, look and see as you have heard." ||43||  Saying this, Lakshmana, skilled in comforting, took the noose from her hand, like a lion taking a deer. ||44|| 

Page #168:
---------------------------
150
Seeing Lakshmana, who was adorned with a beautiful form, with her slow eyes, the girl, filled with shyness, became overwhelmed with wonder. 45
The newly-wed, trembling slightly, thought to herself, 46
"Is this happiness bestowed upon me by the forest goddesses, or is it the great compassion of the one who has come with a message?" 47
"This lord, who has saved my life, has arrived here by divine destiny. 48
Thinking thus, and slightly perspiring, Vanamala, embracing Lakshmana, became radiant with joy. 49
Then, on a bed of soft, fragrant flowers, Rama awoke and looked for Lakshmana. Not seeing him, he got up and asked Sita, "Devi, where is Lakshmana?" 50-51
"He was sleeping near us, on a bed of flowers and leaves, at dusk, but now he is not to be seen." 52
Sita replied, "O Lord, call out to him." Then, in a loud voice, Rama said, "O Lakshmana, where have you gone? Come, come, O son, O brother, where are you? Speak quickly!" 53-54
Hearing Rama's voice, Lakshmana, in a flustered tone, replied, "Dev, I am coming." Saying this, he came to his elder brother, accompanied by Vanamala. 55
At that time, it was the middle of the night, the moon had risen, and a fragrant, cool breeze was blowing from the heart of the kumuda flowers. 56
Then, Vanamala, with her lotus-like hands folded in salutation, her whole body covered in clothes, her face blushing with shyness, knowing all her duties, and filled with utmost humility, bowed down to the feet of Rama and Sita. 57-58
Seeing Lakshmana with his wife, Sita said, "O Kumar, you have made friends with the moon!" 59
Rama asked Sita, "Devi, how do you know?" Sita replied, "Dev, I know by his actions. Listen, his behavior is similar to..." 60
"Just as the foam disappears from the lotus, in the same way, he has snatched away the garland from his hand." 44

**151** The moon, accompanied by its radiance, arrived at that time. Lakshmana, along with the young girl, was also there. **6**

**62** Saying, "As you know, this is clear," Lakshmana stood near her, his face slightly downcast.

**63** Their eyes, like blooming lotuses, were filled with joy. Their faces, like the moon, were radiant. They were gentle and filled with wonder.

**64** They, resembling celestial beings, were comfortably situated there, engaged in conversations filled with gentle smiles, their stories fitting the occasion.

**65** At that time, the companions of Vanamala, having awakened, saw the bed empty and were filled with fear.

**66** Then, with tear-filled eyes and troubled minds, their cries of distress awakened the warriors.

**67** Upon learning the news, seven brave warriors mounted their steeds, while others, armed with spears and bows, prepared to march on foot.

**68** Their minds filled with fear and joy, they raced in all directions, swift as the young of the wind.

**69** Some of them saw Vanamala with her companions and informed the rest of the people through swift messengers.

**70** Having learned the full story, those filled with joy informed the king of the Earth, declaring it a fortunate event.

**71** The king said, "My lord, even though the auspicious beginning has not yet occurred, today the treasure of great jewels has manifested itself.

**72** Today, rain has fallen from the sky without clouds, and crops have sprung up from the fields without the need for plowing or sowing."

**73** "Your son-in-law, Lakshmana, is near the city, and he has met with Vanamala, who desires to give up her life."

**74** "Rama, along with Sita, who is most dear to you, is here, adorned like Indra, accompanied by Sachi."

**75** Hearing these words of his servants, filled with auspicious news, the king, his heart overflowing with joy, fainted for a moment.

**60** I am engaged in the same activities, listen.

Having regained consciousness, the king, whose face shone with a gentle smile like the moon, was filled with immense joy. He bestowed upon his servants a great deal of wealth.  ||76|| He thought to himself, "How fortunate my daughter is! Her uncertain desire has been fulfilled by itself." ||77|| For all beings, wealth, the attainment of their desires, and the cause of their happiness are all obtained through the power of good karma. ||78|| Even if a desired object is separated by a hundred yojanas, it can be obtained in a mere moment by those with good karma. ||79|| On the other hand, those beings who are devoid of good karma are constantly afflicted with suffering, and even if a desired object comes into their hands, it will flee away. ||80|| In forests, on mountain peaks, on difficult paths, and even in the midst of the ocean, those with good karma find their desires fulfilled. ||81|| Pondering thus, the king, filled with joy, lifted his wife and recounted the entire story to her, his words faltering due to his overwhelming happiness. ||82|| The queen, with a beautiful face, asked repeatedly, fearing it might be a dream.  Her doubts were dispelled, and she experienced the joy of self-awareness. ||83|| 

Then, as the sun rose, its rays resembling the red lips of the queen, the king, filled with love, accompanied by all his relatives, mounted his magnificent elephant, Prithividhara, eager to see his beloved. ||84-85||  The queen, Vanamala, accompanied by her eight sons, rode in a beautiful palanquin, following the path of her husband. ||86|| Behind them, by the king's order, servants carried an abundance of precious gifts, including fragrant garlands and other beautiful objects. ||87|| 

From a distance, the king saw Rama, whose eyes were like blooming lotuses, and dismounting from his elephant, he approached him with reverence. ||88|| Then, the king, a knower of dharma and pure of heart, embraced Rama and Lakshmana with great affection, inquiring after their well-being and that of Sita. ||89||

"The merchant, seated comfortably, was asked about the matter. The place was adorned by the Raghuvamsha, the king, the earth-holder." ||

The messenger, his body weary from the long journey, approached the king. He bowed and sat down, quickly presenting the letter. ||2||

The king, recognizing the name on the letter, took it and handed it to the scribe, a master of treaties and conflicts. ||3||

The scribe, skilled in all scripts, honored by the king's gaze, opened the letter. He read it silently once, then read it aloud in a clear voice. ||4||

"Greetings, greetings, to the one with the generous and auspicious influence, the wise, the wealthy, the bringer of peace to the humble kings. The king, Ativirya, is blessed with prosperity and auspiciousness. ||5||

"He is like the king of the mountains, the Sumeru, renowned for his great glory, skilled in weaponry and scriptures. He is embraced by the kings of kings, his prowess has subdued his enemies, he has won the affection of all the earth, his brilliance shines like the rising sun. He is supremely powerful, a master strategist in all matters, adorned with countless virtues. The glorious Ativirya, the king of kings, sends his greetings to the king, Prithvi-dhar, currently residing in Vijaynagar, from his capital, Nandya-avartapur, through this written message. He inquires about your well-being. ||6-8||

"Know that my vassals, with their treasures and armies, are by my side on this earth. ||10||

"Various Mlechchha kings, with their four-armed armies, have arrived here. They are all equal in their power, their weapons gleaming in their hands. ||11||

"The great king, Vijay-shardul, with his immense wealth and power, his mind drawn to our virtues, has also arrived, like the mountain Anjanagiri, with eight hundred elephants, a thousand horses like the swift wind, and..." ||12-13||

In the Padma Purana,
Mrigadhwaja, Ranormi, Kalabha, and Kesari, the kings of Anga, each accompanied by six hundred elephants and five thousand horses, have arrived, filled with great enthusiasm and possessing wise minds. ||14-15||
The king of Panchala, skilled in deceitful warfare, a master of the science of politics, a pragmatist, and knowledgeable about all aspects of war, is being encouraged by the king of Paundra, a bearer of supreme valor, who has arrived with two thousand elephants and seven thousand horses. ||16-17||
Just as hundreds of rivers merge into the flow of the Reva, so too has the king of Magadha arrived, accompanied by an even greater army than the king of Paundra. ||18||
The king Sukesha, who wears the thunderbolt, has arrived with eight thousand elephants, as radiant as clouds, and a force of horses whose end is difficult to find. ||19||
The kings of the Bhavanas, Subhadra, Muni Bhadra, Sadhu Bhadra, and Nandana, who possess the might of Indra, have also arrived. ||20||
The king Singhavirya, endowed with inexhaustible valor, and the king of Vanga, Simharatha, both my maternal uncles, have arrived with a magnificent army. ||21||
The king of Vatsa, Maridatta, has arrived with a vast force of infantry, chariots, elephants, and the finest horses. ||22||

I have set out for Bharata, accompanied by all these kings. I await your arrival, as soon as you have read this letter. ||25||
You must come here with joy, as your presence is eagerly awaited. We look forward to seeing you with the same reverence that farmers look forward to the rain. ||26||
Upon reading this letter, King Prithividhara did not speak a word to his son, Sumitra. ||27||

The thirty-seventh chapter, the great valor and the cleverness of Bharata. O Bhadra, O wise messenger, do you know what caused the anger of Ativirya towards Bharata? (28)
The messenger Vayu-Gati, being asked, said, "I know everything, for I am a very close confidant of the king." (29)
Lakshmana said, "I wish to hear the details." Then Vayu-Gati said, "If you are curious, listen with a calm mind, I will tell you." (30)
He said, "Once our king Ativirya sent a wise and learned messenger named Shruta-Buddhi to Bharata. He went and told Bharata, 'I am the messenger of Ativirya, who is as powerful as Indra, who is worshipped by all kings, and who is very skilled in the use of diplomacy.' (31-32)
'He is like a lion among men, and his enemies, like frightened deer, cannot sleep in their own homes because of fear of him. (33)
'The whole earth, with its four oceans as its girdle, obeys him like a woman, and he is a man of noble deeds. His soul is very strong, and he has conquered all sides. (34)
'He commands you through me, O Bharata! Come quickly and accept my master's service, or leave Ayodhya and flee to the other side of the ocean.' (35-36)
Then Shatrughna, whose body was filled with anger, and whose voice was like a roaring fire, said, "O messenger, does Bharata accept his master's service in such a way that it is right for him to say this? (37)
'Bharata, who is worthy of prosperity, will leave Ayodhya and go to the other side of the ocean to subdue the petty men, leaving Ayodhya to his ministers.' (38-39)
'But I tell you, just as the roar of a donkey is not appropriate towards a mad elephant, so too, the roar of your master towards Bharata is not at all appropriate.' (40)
'Or perhaps his words clearly indicate his death. It seems that he is a harbinger of destruction, or perhaps he is under the control of the wind.' (41)

The king, having been possessed by a planet, was surrounded by wicked people, and went to the forest of penance, seeking dispassion. ||42|| Although the fire of his father, desiring liberation, had been extinguished, yet I am a spark that has come out of it, and I will burn your king. ||43|| Even when a lion is calm, its cub attacks elephants, whose necks are stained with the mud of the elephants' blood. ||44|| Saying this, and laughing loudly, like a whole assembly, with his fiery presence, he burned the forest of bamboo, which was as terrible as a burning forest. ||45|| And he said, "Let this wicked, weak-willed fellow be treated like a dog, quickly." ||46|| Having said this, the enraged warriors seized the messenger by the feet and dragged him along, so that he cried out like a dog being beaten. ||47|| He was dragged to the middle of the city and then released. Then, burning with the pain of the harsh words, and covered in dust, he left. ||48|| Then, the great king Bharata, who was as deep as the ocean, a knower of the ultimate truth, and who had been somewhat angered by the messenger's unprecedented harsh words, set out from the city, accompanied by his brother Shatrughna and his ministers, to retaliate against the enemy. ||49-50|| Hearing this, the king of Mithila, Kanaka, came to meet Bharata with a large army, and the kings like Singhodara, who were devoted to Bharata, also arrived. ||51|| Thus, Bharata, who protected his people like a father, and who was skilled in justice, set out towards Nandyaavarta with a large army. ||52|| On the other hand, the king Ativirya, who was as terrible as the ocean, who was burning with anger, who had been greatly angered by the messenger who had shown his humiliation, and who was surrounded by many great and wondrous ministers, decided to attack Bharata. ||53-54|| Then, with the mark of a young moon on his forehead, and adorned with a garland of forest flowers, he spoke freely to his army, saying, 

Page #177:
---------------------------
159
It is indeed fitting for Bharata to do such a thing, being endowed with extraordinary strength. His elder brother, equal to his father, has been insulted. ||56||
Having said, "I will come," the king, Prithvi-dhara, sent the messenger away. The king, Prithvi-dhara, consulted with Rama. ||57||
"Ati-virya is very difficult to overcome, so I will go to him in disguise." Having said this, the king, Prithvi-dhara, spoke. Rama, reassured, said, ||58||
"This task must be accomplished by us secretly. Therefore, O king, there is no need for great pomp and ceremony." ||59||
"You stay here and do your work. I will go to the enemy with your son and son-in-law." ||60||
Having said this, Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana and Sita, mounted his chariot and, with a large army, set out for Nandya-varta-puri, taking the sons of the king, Prithvi-dhara, with him. They traveled swiftly and stopped near the city. ||61-62||
After performing their ablutions, eating, and other bodily functions, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita consulted with the sons of Prithvi-dhara. ||63||
In the midst of the consultation, Sita said to Rama, "O lord, although I have no right to speak in your presence, for what is the brilliance of a star in the presence of the sun? ||64||
"Nevertheless, O god, I am speaking out of a desire for your welfare. Even a gem born from a creeper is worthy of being taken." ||65||
Sita said, "This Ati-virya is very strong, has a large army, and is cruel. How can he be defeated by Bharata?" ||66||
"Therefore, quickly devise a plan to defeat him. For a task begun hastily is prone to doubt." ||67||
"Although there is nothing in the three worlds that you and Lakshmana cannot accomplish, it is praiseworthy to begin a task without abandoning the present one." ||68||
Then Lakshmana said, "O goddess, why do you say this? Tomorrow you will see Ati-virya slain by me in battle." ||69||
"My head is purified by the dust of Rama's feet. Even the gods cannot stand before me. What then of Ati-virya?" ||70||
1. Therefore, I will defeat him.

In the Padma Purana, the curious man does not come until he comes. Until then, let him see the five qualities of the small-virtuous one. ||7|| The young, proud, and arrogant, even when related, this word is like a counter-response, elevated. ||72|| Then, the great-minded one, preventing the confusion with a frown, spoke to Lakshmana, the ocean of patience, with a smile. ||73|| What has been said is right, my dear, Janaki has spoken the truth, but it has not been fully revealed due to fear of revealing the secret. ||74|| Listen to her intention. She is saying that since Ativirya is arrogant due to his strength, he cannot be subdued by Bharata in the battlefield. ||75|| Bharata is not even a tenth of him, he is like a blazing fire, so what can this great elephant do to him? ||76|| Even though Bharata is rich in horses, Ativirya is rich in elephants, just as a lion cannot do anything to the Vindhyachal, similarly Bharata cannot do anything to Ativirya. ||77|| There is no doubt that he will defeat Bharata, or there will be victory for one of the two, but it will lead to the destruction of living beings. ||78|| When there is conflict between two individuals without any reason, both sides of the humans are bound to be destroyed. ||79|| And if the wicked Ativirya subdues Bharata, then see what kind of disgrace will be born in the Raghuvanshi lineage? ||80|| It does not seem that there will be any peace in this matter, because the proud Shatrughna, due to his childhood, has committed many offenses against the very arrogant enemy. Listen, along with Raudrabhuti, Shatrughna, in the dark of night, raided and killed many of his sleeping heroes, and many elephants, who were difficult to climb and from whom streams of intoxication were flowing. ||81-83|| He stole sixty-four thousand horses, swift as the wind, and seven hundred elephants, as vast as the Anjanagiri mountain, which were outside his city, and took them to Bharata in three days. Have you not heard this from the people? ||84-85||

The thirty-seventh chapter. Having seen many kings deeply wounded and many kings lifeless, and having learned of the abduction of a large army, the king of Kalinga was filled with extreme anger. Now he is vigilant on all sides and, with the thought of revenge against his enemy, awaits the battle. ||86-87|| Bharat is the best among the proud and also wise, therefore he does not want to use any other means than a battle-like strategy to conquer him. ||88|| Although you can fix this, it is not apparent to whom? Or, father, let it go, you have the power to even bring down the sun, but Bharat is present in this very region, that is, he is very close from here, so it is not appropriate to reveal yourself in that way by coming out from Ayodhya at this time. ||89-90|| Those who do great favors to humans while remaining unknown, are highly praiseworthy, like the rain clouds that have gone away silently after showering. ||91|| Thus, while deliberating, the idea of subduing Ativirya came to Rama, and then the deliberation was concluded. ||92|| Then, after meeting with his loved ones, Rama spent the night happily, free from carelessness, telling the best of stories. ||93|| The next day, leaving the camp, Rama saw the Jain temple along with the Aryikas, and with folded hands, he entered it with great devotion. ||94|| Entering inside, he bowed to the Jina and the Aryikas. There, he placed Sita near the Ganini named Vardharma, and left all his weapons near Sita. Then, the extremely clever Rama disguised himself as a dancer, and Lakshmana, etc., who were also adorned with extremely beautiful forms, also donned the attire of women. ||95-96|| After that, Rama, along with everyone, set out towards the gate of the royal palace, playfully performing the auspicious worship of the Jina. ||97|| Seeing those dancers, comparable to the celestial dancers of Indra, all the citizens of the city followed them in amazement. ||98|| Then, those dancers, adorned with excellent gestures and beautiful ornaments, reached the gate of the royal palace, captivating the eyes and minds of everyone. ||99||
1. Dancer. 2. The merchants saw them as equals.

In the Puranas,

Those twenty-four devotees, being devoted to the Jinas,
"We bow to them," thus they uttered the Teva-Leva sound. ||10||
Having decided to sing the stories of the Puranas, with their eyes wide open,
Those dancing women, deeply engrossed in the Bharata's melody, ||101||
Hearing that unprecedented sound, the king, attracted by their qualities,
Approached them like a weight of wood drawn to water. ||102||
Then, taking a twirl, with her beautiful limbs twisting,
The best dancer went towards the king. ||103||
With her smiling glances, her eyebrows moving,
The trembling of her breasts, which only wise men could understand, ||104||
With her slow and graceful movements, the swaying of her hips,
And the playful movements of her hand-like leaves, ||105||
With her feet quickly touching the ground, leaving it behind,
She quickly performed various postures, her hair flowing. ||106||
With the movement of her waist, the display of her body,
The whole world was struck by the arrows of love. ||107||
With her swooning sounds, her notes and melodies used in their proper places,
That dancer sang, blending her voice with that of her companions. ||108||
Wherever that dancer stood, the whole assembly turned their eyes there. ||109||
Their eyes were captivated by her form, their ears by her sweet voice,
And their minds were firmly bound by both her form and voice. ||110||
The chieftains, with their mouths wide open, eager to give gifts,
Became devoid of ornaments, only their clothes remaining. ||111||
"That dance of hers, accompanied by singing and music,
Could subdue even the gods, let alone ordinary beings in battle." ||112||

**Reciting the Story of Rishabha and Others**

Having captivated the entire assembly with a concise narration of the lives of Rishabha and other Tirthankaras, the dancer, filled with music and radiant brilliance, was ready to deliver an unbearable rebuke to the king.  

She said, "O Ativirya! What is this extremely wicked act of yours? This deed of yours is devoid of any policy. Who has employed you in this task?"

"Just as a jackal provokes a lion, you have similarly provoked the peaceful-minded Bharata to destroy himself. Why have you done this?"

"Even after all this, if you cherish your life, then quickly adopt utmost humility and go appease Bharata."

"O Bhadra! May your wives, born in pure lineages and embodiments of excellent playfulness, not become widows."

"These excellent women, deprived of you, have abandoned all their ornaments. They will surely not shine, just like stars without the moon."

"Therefore, quickly turn back your mind, which is engrossed in evil thoughts. Arise, go and bow down to Bharata, you are wise."

"Do this, O low-born man! If you do not do this, then you will be destroyed today, there is no doubt about it."

"You desire the kingdom while Bharata, the grandson of Anaranya, is alive. What is the beauty of the moon when the sun is shining?"

"Just as a foolish moth, attracted to the light, with weak wings, meets its death, so too, you, who are attached to your form and have wicked advisors, have met your death today."

"You, being insignificant like a water snake, desire to compete with Bharata, who is like Garuda, a great soul."

Hearing this criticism of himself and praise of Bharata from the dancer's mouth, King Ativirya, with his eyes red with anger, became agitated along with the entire assembly.

The assembly, with its love extinguished, its minds hardened, and its brows furrowed like waves, was agitated like the waves of the ocean.

Padma Purana
When Ativirya raised his sword, the dancer, displaying a playful illusion, jumped up and snatched the sword.  Seeing this, all the kings, Ativirya was captured alive and his hair was tightly bound. ||127-128|| Raising his sword, the dancer looked at the kings and said, "Whoever is disrespectful here will be killed by me, without a doubt." ||129|| If you cherish your lives, abandon the side of Ativirya and adorn yourselves with humility.  Quickly bow down at the feet of Bharata, who is dear to life. ||130|| Bharata, the moon of the Dasharath dynasty, is victorious, adorned with the brilliance of virtues, bringing joy to the world.  His Lakshmi, like the moon, flourishes, free from the scorching sun of enemies, as he performs wondrous deeds. ||131-132|| Then, the people exclaimed, "Oh, what a wonder! This is like a great illusion!" ||133|| What is the power of this Bharata, whose dancing girls perform such feats? He could even conquer Indra! ||134|| Who knows what this king Bharata will do to us, having captured us? Or will he show mercy to those who bow down to him? ||135|| Then, Rama, mounted on an elephant, along with his entourage, went to the Jina temple. ||136|| There, he dismounted the elephant and, filled with joy, entered the temple, performing a grand puja with auspicious words. ||137|| In the temple, along with the entire congregation, Rama, with Sita, performed a grand puja for the Ganini named Vardharma, who was staying there, and she was pleased. ||138|| Here, Rama handed over Ativirya to Lakshmana, and he was ready to kill him.  Then, Sita said, "O Lakshmidas! Do not cut his throat, nor grab his hair with force, you who have a cruel heart.  Be merciful, O Kumar!" ||139-140|| What is the fault of this poor man? Although men are subject to misfortune due to the consequences of their actions, those who are virtuous protect them. ||141||

The Thirty-Seventh Chapter

Even for the Sadhus, it is not proper to cause pain to ordinary people. What to speak of this one who is worshipped by thousands of kings? || 142 || 
O Bhadra! You have subdued him, so release him. Knowing his own strength, where will he go now? || 143 || 
Having captured powerful enemies, they are released after being honored according to the agreement. This is an ancient tradition. || 144 || 
Thus spoken to, Lakshmana, placing his hands on his head, said, "Devi! What you say is true." || 145 || 
"Let it be so, my lord. Let him be released by your command. By your grace, I can make him worthy of worship even by the gods." || 146 || 
Thus, with the commotion calmed, Lakshmana standing firm, Ativirya, with a clear mind, praised Padma and spoke. || 147 || 
"Well done, well done! You have done a wonderful thing. My mind, which had never arisen before, has now arisen." || 148 || 
Seeing him with his crown and garland removed, Raghava, compassionate and with a gentle form, reassured him, saying, "O Bhadra! Do not give in to despair. Hold fast to your ancient courage. It is only the great who experience wealth accompanied by misfortune." || 149-150 || 
"There is no harm here! In this continuous Nandya-vartta, be obedient to Bharata and rule as you wish." || 151 || 
Then Ativirya said, "I have no desire for the kingdom now. The kingdom has given me its fruit. Now I wish to engage in something else." || 152 || 
"With a burning desire for honor, I wished to conquer the entire earth from the Himalayas to the ocean. But I have uprooted my own honor and become empty. How can I, holding onto my manhood, bow down to another?" || 153-154 || 
"Even those great men who protected this six-part earth were not satisfied. How can I be satisfied with these five villages?" || 155 || 
"See the strength of this karma done in past lives, by which I have been brought down like the moon by Rahu's shadow." || 156 || 

Page #184:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
I have now spoken of the essence of this human birth. What else is there to be said about the affairs of the gods? ||157||
Fearing rebirth, I have been awakened by you. I will now engage in such an endeavor by which liberation is attained. ||158||
Having said this, and having sought forgiveness from him and his entourage, Kesari-like in his valor, he went to the Muni Shrutidhara Shruti. ||159||
Making a bow with his lotus-like hands, he said, "O Lord, I desire the Digambara initiation." ||160||
The Acharya said, "So be it." Abandoning his clothes and other possessions, and having his hair shaved, he became a bearer of the great vows. ||161||
Devoted to the Self, free from attachment, aversion, and possessions, he wandered the earth, a hero, stopping wherever the sun set. ||162||
Fearless, he made his abode in the dense forests, where cruel beasts roamed, and in the caves of the mountains. ||163||
Salute that great Muni Ativirya, who has abandoned all possessions, who has taken upon himself the burden of good conduct, who is of excellent character, and whose body has been dried up by various austerities. ||164||
Salute that great Muni Ativirya, who is adorned with the beautiful ornaments of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, whose garments are the directions themselves, whose ornaments are the twenty-eight root virtues of the Munis, who has set out to conquer the enemy of karma, and who is worthy of liberation. ||165||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! Whoever, wise and intelligent, hears or reads about this excellent conduct of Muni Ativirya, attains wisdom in the midst of the assembly, and, like the sun, shines brightly, never experiencing hardship." ||166||
Thus ends the thirty-seventh chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Ativirya-Nishkramana," narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. ||37||

Then, the wise in politics, Vijayarath, the son of Ativirya, was crowned by his father. ||1|| He showed all his wealth and offered his sister, Ratnimala, the daughter of his mother, Arvind, to Lakshmana. ||2|| Lakshmana accepted her, saying, "So be it."  Knowing that he had obtained Lakshmi herself, he was overjoyed. ||3|| Then, Lakshmana, along with others, performed a wondrous worship of the Jina, and returned to Vijayapur, the city of King Prithvidhar. ||4|| Hearing about Ativirya's initiation due to the capture of the dancer, Shatrughna laughed. Bharat stopped him, saying, ||5|| "O Bhadra! Why do you laugh at Ativirya, who is greatly blessed, having renounced the painful worldly pleasures and attained supreme peace? ||6|| See the power of his penance, which is rare even for the gods. He who was our enemy has now become a sage, worthy of our prostration. ||7||" While Bharat was praising Ativirya, Vijayarath arrived with many vassals. ||8|| He prostrated before Bharat, engaged in pleasant conversation for a while, and then presented to him his elder sister, Vijaysundari, a beautiful maiden adorned with various ornaments. With a cheerful countenance, he also offered a vast treasury and a strong army. ||9-10||  Bharat was delighted to receive this unique maiden. He granted all the wishes of Vijayarath, for this is the way of great souls. ||11||

Then, Bharat, whose mind was filled with curiosity and eagerness, set out on swift horses to see the sage Ativirya. ||12|| With a noble heart, he kept asking, "Where is that great sage?" And his servants kept saying, "He is ahead." ||13||

That mountain, described by knowledgeable servants, was extremely difficult to traverse, with a multitude of rocks, filled with various trees, fragrant with the scent of flowers, and teeming with wild animals. ||14|| Bharat ascended this mountain and dismounted his horse, adorned in a humble attire, to seek the darshan of Ativirya Muni. ||15|| The Muni was free from anger and joy, possessed of tranquil senses, a Vibhu, seated on a rock, fearless like a lion. ||16|| He was engaged in severe austerities, absorbed in auspicious meditation, and radiant with the glory of a Shraman. ||17|| Upon seeing the Muni, everyone's eyes widened, their bodies thrilled with joy, and they were filled with utmost wonder, bowing down with folded hands. ||18|| Bharat, dear to the Shramans, performed great worship to the Muni, prostrated at his feet, and with a bowed body, spoke with devotion: "O Lord! You alone are the valiant one, the knower of the ultimate truth, who has embraced this difficult initiation, bestowed by the Jinas. ||19-20|| Such is the endeavor of great souls born into pure lineages, who have understood the essence of the world. ||21|| You have attained the fruit desired by those who reach the human realm, O Sadhu! But we are deeply distressed. ||22|| Forgive any wrong or sinful actions we may have committed towards you. You are fulfilled, worthy of the highest reverence, and we offer our salutations to you. ||23||" Saying this, Bharat offered salutations and circumambulated the great Sadhu, then descended from the mountain, narrating the story to the silent ones. ||24|| He mounted his elephant, accompanied by thousands of his vassals, and set out for Ayodhya, amidst the ocean of wealth. ||25|| Situated amidst a vast army and retinue of vassals, Bharat shone like Jambudvipa amidst other islands. ||26|| Bharat thought with a happy heart: "Where have those dancers gone, who, disregarding their own lives, have pleased me? ||27||

The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

Having paid the highest praise to the great prowess, the work done by the dancers is truly wonderful. ||28|| Where else in the entire world is there such power in women? This work has certainly been done by the goddesses of the Jina's teachings. ||29|| With a mind filled with joy, he went to see the earth filled with various kinds of grains. ||30|| His fame spread throughout the entire world, bearing the ultimate influence, and he, along with Shatrughna, entered Ayodhya, filled with the highest joy. ||31|| He stayed there with Vijay Sundari, enjoying her company, like the sound of thunder with Sulochana. ||32|| Rama and Lakshmana, bringing joy to all the worlds, stayed in the city of the earth-bearer for a while. ||33|| Then, after consulting with Janaki, their minds set on duty, they were ready to depart for their desired destination. ||34|| Then, Vanamala, with beautiful features, her eyes filled with tears and trembling eyelashes, spoke to Lakshmana: "My dear, if you had to leave me, a woman of bad fortune, why did you save me from death earlier? Tell me." ||35-36|| Then, Lakshmana said: "My dear, my beloved, my beautiful one, do not be sad. I will return very soon." ||37|| "My dear, who enjoys the finest pleasures, if I do not return to you soon, I will attain the same fate as those who are deprived of right vision." ||38|| "My dear, if I do not return to you, I will be stained by the sin of those arrogant men who insult the virtuous." ||39|| "My beloved, we must protect our father's words as if they were our own lives, and we must go to the shore of the southern ocean without any hesitation." ||40|| "I will go to the valley of the Malaya mountain, build a magnificent dwelling, and then bring you there. My dear, with beautiful thighs, be patient until then." ||41|| Thus, Lakshmana, having pacified Vanamala with oaths filled with beautiful words, went to Rama. ||42|| 

1. Ayodhya. 
2. Jayakumar, another name for Meghasvara. 
3. Malaya valley. 
4. Malaya. 
5. Oaths.

In the Padma Purana, when all the people were asleep, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita left the city without anyone knowing. They set out on their journey. ||43|| When morning came, the entire populace saw the city devoid of them and were overcome with immense grief. They struggled to sustain their bodies. ||44|| Seeing her home bereft of Lakshmana, Vanamala was consumed by sorrow. She clung to the oaths Lakshmana had taken and remained alive. ||45||  Rama and Lakshmana, possessing great fortitude, wandered the earth, bringing joy to all who beheld them. They were a sight to behold. ||46|| They moved slowly, their gaze fixed on the beautiful, youthful vines, their hearts and eyes like the blossoms, burning with the fire of Kamadeva's arrows. ||47|| Oh friend, whose lineage have these two adorned? What fortunate mother gave birth to these two? ||48|| Blessed is the woman who walks the earth with them. If such beauty belongs to the gods, then surely they are gods themselves. ||49|| From where have these handsome men come? Where are they going? What do they desire? How did this happen? ||50|| Oh friends, you saw these two, their eyes like lotuses, their faces like the moon, walking together with a woman on this path. ||51|| Oh, you with the captivating eyes, whether these two are men or gods, why do you grieve, having lost your husband? ||52|| Oh, foolish one, such a sight is not easily obtained without great merit. ||53|| Return, regain your health, pick up your fallen clothes, and do not let your eyes be filled with excessive sorrow. ||54|| Oh, young girl, what is the use of seeing these two, who steal hearts and eyes? Be patient. ||55|| Thus, engaging the women in conversation, these two pure-hearted men continued their journey at will. ||56|| They wandered through the earth, encompassing various lands, and reached the magnificent city of Kshemanjali. ||57|| Near the city, they rested comfortably in a beautiful garden, resembling a cluster of clouds. ||58||

Having eaten the excellent food prepared by Lakshmana, Rama, along with Sita, enjoyed the sweet drink of honey. ||59||

Then, Lakshmana, whose eyes were filled with wonder at the sight of the magnificent palaces resembling mountains, respectfully sought permission from Rama and, with a cheerful heart, set out to see the city, adorned with a fine garland and a yellow robe. ||60-61||

He saw many beautiful forests, entwined with various creepers, rivers with clear water and banks as bright as white clouds, mountains of various metals for play, lofty Jain temples, wells, tanks, assembly halls, and water-sheds, and a variety of people. With great composure, he entered the city, bustling with various trades. People were looking at him with wonder. ||62-64||

As he reached the main street of the city, he heard a city dweller speaking with confidence, saying, "Listen, listen! Who is the brave man in the world who will dare to accept the power relinquished by the king's hand and take the 'Jitpadma' maiden?" ||65-66||

"Even if the king were to offer the kingdom of heaven, what is the use of this story related to power?" ||67||

"If someone comes forward to face the power and loses his life, what will this maiden and the kingdom of heaven do for him?" ||68||

"Life is dearer than all things in the world, and everything else is for its sake. Who does not know this?" ||69||

Hearing this, Lakshmana, out of curiosity, asked a man, "O noble one! Who is this Jitpadma, about whom people are talking?" ||70||

The man replied, "Do you not know this maiden of the present time, whose fame is spread throughout the world and who considers herself very wise?" ||71||

"She is the virtuous daughter of King Shatrudaman of this city, born to Queen Kanakabha." ||72||

"Because she conquered the lotus with her beauty, she is called Jitpadma. The lotus is conquered by her entire body." ||73||

In the Padma Purana, a girl adorned with the ornaments of art, endowed with youthful beauty, hates even the gods, let alone men. ||7|| She does not utter a single word that is masculine in grammar. All her actions are devoid of any purpose related to men. ||75|| Look, you see a magnificent palace, as grand as Mount Kailasa. In it resides this girl, pampered with a hundred kinds of services. ||76|| The man who can endure the power released by her father's hand, he alone will be chosen by her. Such a difficult vow has she taken. ||77|| Hearing this, Lakshmana, filled with anger, pride, and wonder, pondered, "What kind of girl is this who desires such a thing?" ||78|| "Let me see this girl, filled with wicked desires and pride. Oh, what a harsh resolve she has made!" ||79|| Thinking thus, Lakshmana, with a gait as graceful as that of a great bull, proceeded along the beautiful royal road. There he saw, with slow eyes, magnificent palaces like celestial chariots, white as the moon, elephants like clouds, horses adorned with fluttering fly whisks, pavilions, and dancing halls. ||80-81|| Then he reached the palace of King Shatrunda, adorned with various flags, vibrant with colors, and resembling a white cloud. ||82|| The palace gate was adorned with hundreds of shining bells and chains, had high ramparts, and was decorated with colorful arches like rainbows. ||83|| Then, entering the gate, surrounded by a group of armed guards, filled with various offerings, and crowded with ministers entering and exiting, the gatekeeper spoke to Lakshmana with gentle words, "O noble sir, who are you, entering the royal palace without permission?" ||84-85|| Then Lakshmana said, "I wish to see the king, go and inform him." Hearing this, the gatekeeper, appointing another in his place, went inside and informed the king, saying, ||86|| "O great king, a man, as handsome as the moon, with lotus eyes, and gentle in nature, desires to see you. He stands at the gate." ||87|| 
Or, she is called Jitapada because she has conquered Lakshmi in her entire body. ||73|| This girl, endowed with youthful beauty and adorned with the ornaments of art, hates even the gods, let alone men. ||74|| She does not utter a single word that is masculine in grammar. All her actions are devoid of any purpose related to men. ||75|| Look, you see a magnificent palace, as grand as Mount Kailasa. In it resides this girl, pampered with a hundred kinds of services. ||76|| The man who can endure the power released by her father's hand, he alone will be chosen by her. Such a difficult vow has she taken. ||77||

Seeing the minister's face, the king said, "Let him enter." Then, at the doorkeeper's request, Lakshmana entered. ||8||

Seeing him, so handsome, even the deep assembly was stirred, like the ocean stirred by the moon. ||89||

Seeing Lakshmana, without prostration, with broad shoulders and shining brightly, the king, his mind somewhat disturbed, asked, ||10||

"From where have you come? Who are you? What is your purpose? Where have you toiled?"

Then Lakshmana, his voice like the thunder of the monsoon clouds, replied, ||11||

"I am a servant of King Bharata, skilled in traversing the earth, a scholar in all matters, and I have come to break the pride of your daughter." ||12||

"You have nurtured this wicked cow, whose pride is unbroken, who brings sorrow to all." ||13||

The king said, "Who is this man, who can withstand the power I have released? Who is this destroyer of Jitapada's pride?" ||14||

Lakshmana said, "Why should I accept one power? Release five powers upon me, with all your might." ||95||

Thus, the dispute between these two proud men continued, while the windows of the palace were covered by the faces of women. ||96||

Seeing Lakshmana, the valiant one, Jitapada, abandoning her hatred for men, came to the balcony and, with a gesture, tried to dissuade him. ||97||

Seeing Jitapada, frightened and with folded hands, Lakshmana, full of joy, gestured to her, saying, "Fear not." ||98||

And he said to the king, "Oh, coward! What are you waiting for? You call yourself Sasrindama, release your power and show your prowess!" ||99||

Thus spoken to, the king, enraged, tightened his belt, picked up a weapon like a blazing fire, and said, ||100||

"If you want to die, then take it!" With a frown, the king, knowing the rituals, stood up from his elevated seat and released the weapon. ||101||

Padma Purana
'Without any effort, he held it with his right hand. What is the honor of Garuda in catching a quail? ||102|| With the other hand, he held the third and fourth shaktis in his armpits, and he was adorned with them, like a four-tusked elephant. ||103|| Then, the fifth shakti, like the hood of a very angry snake, came to him. He held it with his teeth, like a king of deer holds a piece of meat. ||104|| Then, the group of gods standing in the sky showered flowers, danced, and made a sound of joy, beating the drums. ||105|| Then, Lakshmana said, "Shabundam! Now you face my power." All the people were filled with great fear. ||106|| King Shatrundama was amazed to see Lakshmana's uninjured body, and his face was lowered in shame. ||107|| Then, Jitpadma, whose face was turned downwards with the shadow of a gentle smile, came to Lakshmana, attracted by his form and conduct. ||108|| She was adorned with the shaktis, standing near Lakshmana, just as Shachi, with her head bowed, is adorned near Indra, the holder of the thunderbolt. ||109|| Lakshmana's heart, which had never trembled even in great battles, trembled at the new meeting with Jitpadma. ||110|| Then, Jitpadma, whose eyes were lowered with the weight of shame, chose Lakshmana in front of her father and many other kings, abandoning her shame. ||111|| Immediately, Lakshmana, whose body was bowed in humility, said to the king, "O Mama! You are worthy to forgive the wrong deeds I did in my childhood." ||112|| Children, by their contrary actions or words, do not become affected by such great men as you. ||113|| Then, King Shatrundama, filled with joy and excitement, embraced Lakshmana with his arms, long and strong like the trunk of an elephant. ||114|| And he said, "O Bhadra! I, who have conquered in terrible battles, have been conquered by my own daughter. ||115|| 
Leave it. ||101||

115. I, who had subdued the enraged, maddened elephants in the fierce battle, am now subdued by you.

116. I, who had rendered powerless the great wild elephants, with their brilliance like that of the Gandha mountain, am now like a different being, subdued by you.

117. Oh, what strength! Oh, what beauty! Your virtues are truly worthy of you. Your humility is truly extraordinary.

118. As the king was praising Lakshmana's virtues in the assembly, Lakshmana, overwhelmed with modesty, seemed to disappear for a moment.

119. Then, by the king's command, the conch shells were blown, their sound like the roar of thunderclouds, and the elephants trumpeted, their sound shaking the earth.

120. As the desired wealth was distributed, a great joy, capable of shaking the entire city, arose.

121. Then, Lakshmana said to the king, "O, best of men, I wish to see the hand-holding ceremony of your daughter."

122. The king replied, "My elder brother resides in a nearby region of this city. Ask him, he knows what is appropriate."

123. Then, the king, with Jitapada and Lakshmana, along with his wives and brothers, proceeded towards Rama with great respect.

124. Hearing the thunderous sound, like the roar of the agitated ocean, and seeing the vast cloud of dust rising, Sita, placing her hands on her knees, rose with difficulty. With trembling voice, she said to Rama, "O, Raghava, it seems Lakshmana has done something rash. This situation appears very alarming. Be cautious and do what needs to be done."

125-126. Embracing Sita, Rama said, "O, Devi, do not be afraid." He then rose quickly, fixing his gaze on his bow.

127. At that moment, he saw a group of women singing auspicious songs in a loud voice in front of the large crowd of men.

128. As the group of women approached, their graceful movements, born from their beautiful bodies, were visible.

129. Seeing them dance, their anklets jingling, Padma, reassured by Sita, entered the palace again.

131. Women with auspicious hands, adorned with ornaments, extremely beautiful, with eyes filled with love, approached Rama.
132. Lakshmana, with a face like a lotus, descended from the chariot along with Jitapadmā and quickly fell at the feet of Rama.
133. After paying obeisance to Rama and Sītā, Lakshmana, filled with humility, stood a little distance away from Rama.
134. The kings, including Shatrudama, in turn, paid their respects to Rama and Sītā and sat in their designated places.
135. After exchanging pleasantries and inquiring about their well-being, the kings, filled with joy, performed a dance.
136. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sītā, filled with supreme wealth and joy, mounted their chariot and entered the city.
137. They arrived at the grand palace, which resembled a lake filled with lotus flowers, the women being the lotuses, adorned with saffron-like beauty, and the ornaments being the birds singing their melodies.
138-139. The noble Rama and Lakshmana, whose hearts were constricted by the fear of the roar of the lion, Satya-vrata, accompanied by the goddess of fortune, Kumarī Lakshmī, and served by Shatrudama, enjoyed great happiness, bringing joy to the hearts of all beings.
140-141. Then, at midnight, Rama, accompanied by Sītā, left the palace at will. Lakshmana, like a garland of flowers, comforted the extremely sorrowful Jitapadmā, who was overwhelmed with separation, with kind words and followed Rama. The citizens lost their courage upon their departure.
142. Gotama Swami said, "O Shrenika! Those who have accumulated good deeds from past lives, who are beloved by all beings, and who perform various duties in whatever country they reside, they find happiness in every heart, without any worry, and enjoy the best food, which is rare even in the three worlds."

Those who have accumulated a great store of **punya** (merit), are dear to all beings. They go to various countries, performing excellent deeds, and in each country they find an abundance of delicious food and other comforts, which are beyond compare and rare for others.  ||142||

"I have no use for these people. Let them go to destruction."  A person who intensely hates worldly pleasures, constantly criticizes them and even goes to the top of a mountain to renounce them, will still be drawn to them, just as the sun, though victorious over the darkness, continues to shine.  A person of **punya** (merit) is capable of attaining all virtues and will always be in contact with these pleasures, even if they do not desire them. ||143||

Thus ends the thirty-eighth chapter of the **Padmacharita**, narrated by the **Acharya** Ravishena, known as the **Aarsha** (ancient) text, which describes the story of **Jitpadma**. ||38||

## The Forty-First Chapter

In the midst of diverse, fragrant, flower-laden lands, adorned with arbors of creepers, and inhabited by happy deer, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sita, arrived, their bodies completely cleansed by divine means. 

Rama, playfully, would pluck a tender leaf, resembling a mung bean, and, making it into an ear ornament, would say, "This will be nice," and place it in Sita's ear.  Sometimes, they would seat Sita on a creeper hanging from a tree, and, standing on either side, would swing her gently. 

At times, they would sit beneath a dense canopy of leaves, and entertain her with captivating stories.  Sita would point out the beauty of a creeper, a Palasha tree, or a flowering vine, exclaiming, "Look at this beautiful creeper! Look at this beautiful Palasha tree! Look at this beautiful vine!"

Sometimes, swarms of bees, attracted by the fragrance of flowers, would harass Sita, and the brothers would protect her with great difficulty. 

Like gods wandering in celestial forests, these two, blessed with auspicious deeds, slowly strolled through diverse forests, accompanied by Sita.  With their gaze fixed on lands suitable for various people, they reached the city of Vanshasthaladyuti.

Though a long time had passed for these virtuous souls, traveling with Sita, that vast period did not bring them even a speck of sorrow.

At the edge of the city, they saw the mountain Vanshadhara, covered with a dense thicket of bamboo, as if it had risen from the earth, its lofty peaks eternally adorned with the glow of twilight, and its waterfalls, like laughing swans, scattering their spray.

Seeing the people fleeing the city, Rama asked, "Why is there such great fear?"

Then Rama asked a man, "O noble one! What is the cause of this great fear?" ||13||
In reply, the man said, "For the past three days, at night, a sound has been rising from the peak of this mountain." ||14||
This sound, which we have never heard before, echoes everywhere and is extremely terrifying. Whose sound is it? Even the most learned elders do not know. ||15||
The entire earth seems to tremble because of this sound, the ten directions seem to make a sound, the lakes seem to wander here and there, and the trees seem to be uprooted. ||16||
This loud sound, comparable to the roar of hell, has shattered the ears of all beings as if they were struck by iron bars. ||17||
It seems that some wicked person, intent on killing us, is playing around at night. ||18||
Frightened by this sound, these people flee at the beginning of the night and return at dawn. ||19||
After walking a little more than a yojana from here, the sound becomes so faint that people can hear each other's conversations and find some relief. ||20||
Hearing this, Sita said to Rama and Lakshmana, "Let us also go where all these people are going." ||21||
Wise men, knowing the time and place, act with courage, and therefore never face any calamity. ||22||
Laughing, Rama and Lakshmana said to the worried Janaka's daughter, "You are very afraid, so go where these people are going." ||23||
"Fearlessly, we will search for you both with these people at dawn, near the foot of this mountain." ||24||
"On this beautiful mountain, whose sound is this extremely terrifying sound? We will see it today," they decided. ||25||
These poor people, filled with anxiety for their children and accompanied by animals, will be terrified. Who can help them? ||26||
Then, with a voice trembling as if she had a fever, Sita said, "Your stubbornness is always like the grip of a crab, which is unique. Who is capable of killing this crab-like affliction of mine?" ||27||

The Padma Purana says that Sita, standing behind Rama and in front of Lakshmana, followed them. ||28||  The goddess, whose lotus-like feet were stained with dust, ascended the mountain, shining like the pure line of the moon on the peak of a cloud. ||29||  Sita, standing between Rama and Lakshmana, adorned the mountain like a crystal rod placed between a moonstone and a sapphire. ||30||  Wherever Sita was in danger of falling from the uneven rocks, the two, lifting her up, carried her; and where there was no danger, they carried her with confidence, supporting her hand. ||31||  Thus, crossing the group of uneven rocks, free from fear, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita, reached the broad peak of the mountain. ||32||
Then, they saw two sages, seated in deep meditation, with their long arms hanging down, who were perfecting the very difficult four-faced image, who were endowed with supreme brilliance, who were as deep as the ocean, who were as steady as a mountain, who knew the difference between the body and the soul, who were free from delusion, who were adorned with the Digambara-mudra, who were oceans of radiance, who were endowed with youthful vigor, who were of excellent form, and who were following the teachings of the scriptures. ||33-35||  Filled with wonder, the three of them, abandoning the refuge of evil deeds, began to think that all the efforts of beings in the world are futile and the cause of suffering. ||36||  Friends, wealth, women, children, and relatives, all are forms of happiness and sorrow; only Dharma is the cause of happiness. ||37||  Then, those who were filled with devotion, who had joined their hands and placed them on their heads, who were filled with supreme joy, and whose bodies were bowed in humility, went to the said sages. ||38||  As soon as they saw them, they saw snakes, who were very terrifying, who were moving here and there, who were making terrible noises, who were as radiant as ground-up collyrium, and whose tongues were flickering, and scorpions, who had raised their tails, who were very terrifying, who were moving together night and day, who were of various colors, and who were very large. ||39-40||
Who is capable? ||27||

## The Forty-Third Chapter

Seeing those sages, Rama and Lakshmana were struck with fear and stood still for a moment.  Sita, filled with fear, clung to her husband.  Rama, instantly dismissing his fear, reassured her, saying, "Do not be afraid."

Approaching them, Rama and Lakshmana drove away the snakes and scorpions that kept returning, using the tip of their bows.  Sita, filled with devotion, washed the feet of the sages with water from the waterfall, anointing them with a fragrant paste.  She then adorned them with flowers from the nearby vines, fragrant with the scent of the forest, which Lakshmana had plucked.

Those who were adorned with lotus buds on their foreheads, and who were experts in the rituals, bowed to the sage with devotion.  Rama, holding the beautiful Veena like a charming woman, played it, singing in a sweet voice with the most beautiful and melodious words.  Lakshmana, like a tree embraced by a creeper of Lakshmi, sang along, his voice like the sweet melody of a cuckoo.

They sang: "Those who are masters of great yoga, who are steadfast and possess noble qualities, who have attained the supreme, unblemished, and world-renowned Arhat, free from all comparisons, through their good fortune; who have broken the rock of great delusion with the staff of meditation; who consider the world as a beggar, devoid of the practice of Dharma; such sages are worthy of being honored by the gods, with their minds, heads, and words."

As Rama and Lakshmana, experts in the art of singing, sang these words, even the hearts of the animals were softened.  Then, Sita, who knew all the graceful dance forms, adorned with beautiful ornaments like necklaces and garlands, displayed her graceful movements with perfect ease.  She was skilled in expressing emotions through gestures, her beautiful arms swaying like vines, and her breasts trembling slightly as she changed rhythms. 

Page #200:

182
In the Padma Purana, Sita danced gracefully with her breasts swaying, her feet silent and her movements in accordance with the principles of music. Her dance was inspired by devotion, like the dance of Shri Devi on Mount Sumeru during the birth ceremony of the Jina. 

Then, as if struck by a calamity, the sun set, and the twilight, with its fleeting brilliance, followed. A dense darkness, swallowing the light of the constellations and resembling a dark cloud, rose and enveloped all directions. 

At that moment, a strange sound, as if piercing the sky, echoed through the directions, causing great commotion. 

The sky was filled with long, dark clouds, their fronts ablaze with lightning, and the world seemed to be fleeing in terror. 

Groups of ghosts, their forms terrifying and their mouths twisted with fangs, roared with laughter. 

The Rakshasas uttered meaningless sounds, the ominous jackals howled, spewing fire, and hundreds of bodies danced in a terrifying manner. 

The clouds rained down heads, chests, arms, and thighs, all covered in thick, foul-smelling drops of blood. 

A Dakini appeared, wielding a sword, her body cruel, her breasts swaying, her lips long, her bones visible, her eyes like chunks of flesh, her head adorned with a garland of skulls, her tongue raised to touch her forehead, and raining down flesh and blood. 

The Rakshasas, with faces like lions and tigers, eyes like glowing iron wheels, tridents in their hands, biting their lips, their foreheads furrowed, their voices harsh, danced in a throng, shaking the mountains and the earth.

## Forty-First Chapter

183. This futile effort was not known to the great Muni, for at that time their *Jnana-karma* was being consumed by the *Shukla-dhyana* within. ||6||

Seeing this event, which caused great fear to the good men, Sita, abandoning her dance, clung to her husband, trembling. ||69||

Padma said to her, "O Devi! O auspicious one! Do not be afraid. Take refuge in the feet of the Muni, which destroy all fear." ||70||

Saying this, Rama placed Sita near the Muni's feet and, along with Lakshmana Kumar, prepared for battle. ||71||

Like two clouds filled with water, they roared, those great bearers of radiance, Rama and Lakshmana, as if releasing thunderbolts, shaking their bows. ||72||

Then, knowing them to be Balabhadra and Narayana, the fire-radiant god, terrified, disappeared. ||73||

With the departure of that celestial being, all his efforts were instantly destroyed, and the sky became clear. ||74||

With the task of the protector fulfilled by those who desired the highest good, *kevala-jnana* arose instantly in the Muni-punga-vas. ||75||

Then, seated on various vehicles, the four classes of gods, filled with joy, praising the fruit of their austerities, arrived. ||76||

Having paid their respects according to the proper rites and performed *kevala-puja*, the gods, with folded hands, sat in their respective places. ||77||

Due to the gathering of the gods, attracted by the birth of *kevala-jnana*, the distinction of night and day, as well as the time, ceased to exist. ||78||

The earth-dwellers, the *vidyadharas*, possessing great strength in the form of knowledge, sat down in their appropriate places, having performed *kevala-puja* to the *kevalins*. ||79||

With joyful hearts, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita, quickly performed *kevala-puja* and sat down in their respective places. ||80||

Then, Padma, with folded hands, asked the great Muni, who was seated on the supreme throne that had arisen at that moment: ||81|| 

Page #202:

184
In the Pashma Purana, the Bhagavants were asked, "By whom was this evil inflicted upon you both at night? Or was this great good fortune born of your own selves?" ||82|| Though both great Munis knew the entire universe, past, present, and future, they spoke in divine voices, one after the other, having attained the state of samya-parinam. ||83|| They said, "In the city of Padmini, there lived a king named Vijayaparbata. His wife, Dharini, was like a fertile field for the growth of virtues." ||84|| King Vijayaparbata had a messenger named Amritasvara, who was well-versed in scriptures, skilled in royal duties, knowledgeable about the world, and fond of virtues. ||85|| His wife was named Upayoga, and she gave birth to two sons, Udit and Mudit. Both sons were very skilled in worldly affairs. ||86|| Once, the king sent Amritasvara on a mission as a messenger. Amritasvara, deeply devoted to his master, went on a journey. ||87|| Vasubhuti, a friend who lived off Amritasvara's food, went with him. Vasubhuti was a man of wicked mind and was lustful for Amritasvara's wife. ||88|| He killed Amritasvara in his sleep with a sword and returned to the city. He told the people that Amritasvara had sent him back. ||89|| Upayoga told Vasubhuti, "Kill our two sons as well, so that we can live in peace." Her daughter-in-law, knowing that her mother-in-law was having an affair with Vasubhuti, quickly informed Udit about this. ||90-91|| Vasubhuti's own wife was always jealous of him because of his affair with Upayoga, and her mind was constantly troubled. Therefore, she told this news to Udit's wife. ||92|| Udit had some doubts about this, and Mudit also knew about it. When he saw the sword in Vasubhuti's hand, everything became clear. ||93|| Filled with rage, Udit killed him. Thus, the wicked Brahmin, who was always engaged in evil deeds, met his end as a mleccha. ||94||

The forty-first chapter

It is said that the great ascetic, Matīvardhana, the lord of the Muni Sangha, while wandering on earth, arrived at the city of Padmini. || 95 || At that time, the Ganini Anuddhara, who was devoted to Dharma-dhyāna, was also present. She was very great and protected the Sangha of Āryikās. || 96 || Matīvardhana, along with the fourfold Sangha, stayed in the beautiful Vasantatilaka garden, which was endowed with excellent land. || 97 || Then, the servants who guarded the garden were very anxious and went to the king, placing their hands on the ground, and said, "O Lord! There is a very steep cliff in front and a tiger behind. Tell us, whose refuge shall we seek? Our destruction is imminent." || 98-99 || The king said, "What? What? What are you saying?" The servants replied, "O Lord! A Sangha of Munis has come and settled in the garden." || 100 || "If we stop them, we will surely receive a curse. And if we don't stop them, you will be angry. Thus, a great calamity has befallen us." || 101 || "O King! By your grace, we have made this garden like a garden of Kalpa trees. Ordinary people cannot enter it." || 102 || "Those Nirgrantha Munis, who are inaccessible due to their tapas-tejas, cannot be stopped even by the gods. What to speak of us, mere mortals?" || 103 || Then, the king, comforting the servants, said, "Don't be afraid." He went to the garden, filled with great wonder. || 104 || The king, who was endowed with great wealth, praised by his captives, and very powerful, went to the garden. || 105 || There, he saw the great Munis, covered in forest dust, engaged in actions worthy of liberation, and with very peaceful minds. || 106 || Some of them were standing like statues, with their arms hanging down, and their bodies were emaciated due to severe fasts like Vela-Tela, etc. || 107 ||

Page #204:
---------------------------
186
In the Padma Purana, some were engrossed in self-study, humming sweet sounds like bees, while others were seated in Padmasana with their minds focused. ||108|| Seeing these munis, the king's pride, like a sprout, was broken. He descended from his elephant and bowed to the munis. The king's name was Vijayaparbata. ||109|| The king, who had attained proper understanding in worldly matters, bowed to all the munis in succession and reached the Acharya. Bowing at his feet, he said, "O best of men! Your radiance is as bright as your auspicious signs. Why then are worldly pleasures not situated at your feet?" ||110-111|| The Acharya replied, "What kind of understanding do you have in your body? Your understanding, which considers the body to be permanent, is false and increases the cycle of birth and death." ||112|| Indeed, this life is as fickle as the ears of an elephant calf, and this human body resembles the pith of a banana tree. ||113|| This wealth and the company of relatives are like a dream. Knowing this, what is there to desire in them? The more you think about these worldly possessions, the more painful they seem. ||114|| This life has resided countless times in a womb that is like hell, terrifying, filled with foul odor, teeming with worms, a reservoir of blood and phlegm, and overflowing with filth. Yet, enveloped in the darkness of great delusion, this being is not afraid of it. ||115-116|| This body, a repository of all impurities, is fleeting, unprotected, ungrateful, and filled with delusion. It is entangled in a network of nerves, covered with a thin skin, afflicted with numerous diseases, and despised by the arrival of old age. This body is despicable. ||117-118|| How can those who are devoid of consciousness, that is, the power of discrimination, find well-being in this body, which is subject to such conditions? ||119|| This soul, like a traveling merchant, is setting out for the other world, but these thieves in the form of senses are stopping it by forcibly robbing people. ||120|| This king of beings, surrounded by the women of delusion, is playing. 

Page #205:

The Forty-First Chapter

187. The mind, like a maddened elephant, runs wild in the paths of sense-objects. It can be controlled only by a man of strong detachment, who relies on the goad of knowledge. ||122||

Those who harbor the desire for the forms of other women, are like horses driven by lust, who, intoxicated with the speed of great delusion, throw the chariot of the body into the mire of evil deeds. ||123||

Therefore, make the reins of the mind very strong, so that it may not be carried away by the passions. ||124||

Bow down to the Jina with devotion, and remember him constantly, so that you may surely cross the ocean of existence. ||125||

Destroy the thorns of delusion with the weapons of austerity and self-control, and, reaching the city of liberation, rule there fearlessly. ||126||

Having heard the Jain grammar, the wise king Vijayaprabhu, abandoning his vast wealth, became a great sage. ||127||

His two sons, Udit and Mudit, also, hearing the Jina's teachings with devotion, became ascetics, and, adorned with great austerity, wandered together over the earth. ||128||

They were going to Sammed Shikhar, to worship the place of liberation, when, by some chance, they lost their way and entered a great forest. ||129||

There, in that forest, Vasubhuti, who had been a human being, had become a fierce mleccha. Seeing them, he was filled with great anger, and called them with harsh words. ||130||

Seeing him eager to kill them, the elder brother, Udit, said to Mudit, "Brother, do not be afraid. Take refuge in meditation, and make your mind steady." ||131||

"This wicked mleccha, with his evil form, is eager to kill us. But today is the time to test the forbearance which we have cultivated for so long." ||132||

Mudit replied, "Brother, what fear can we have, who are steadfast in the words of the Jina? Surely, we have also brought about his death by our foolishness." ||133||

Thus, talking in this way, the two brothers, with calm minds, stood firm, and, abandoning all attachment to their bodies, attained the state of image-meditation. ||134||

Then, the mleccha, eager to kill them, approached them. But, by the grace of God, the leader of the tribe of mleccha saw him, and prevented him from doing so. ||135||

Hearing this, Rama asked the Kevali, "Why did the mleccha want to kill them? What was the reason?" ||136|| 

Page #206:
---------------------------
188
In a past life, a divine voice emerged from the Kevali, saying that in a city called Yakshastana, there lived two brothers named Surapa and Karshaka. ||137|| One day, a hunter captured a bird and brought it to the village. Moved by compassion, Surapa and Karshaka paid a price to free the bird. ||138|| Later, the bird died and became a Mlechcha king, while Surapa and Karshaka died and became Udit and Mudit. ||139|| Because they had protected the bird in its previous life, the bird, now a general, protected these two monks. ||140|| The hunter, through the power of karma, was reborn as a Brahmin named Vasubhuti, achieving the highest human existence. ||141|| As one acts in a previous life, so they are born in this life. This is the fate of all beings in the cycle of existence. ||142|| What is the point of studying scriptures created by Indra and others? The only duty is to accumulate good karma, which is the cause of happiness. ||143|| Due to the influence of their good karma, the two monks, freed from suffering, reached the Nirvana realm, the Sammed Shikhar, and paid homage to the Jinas. ||144|| Thus, they wandered through many beautiful realms, worshipped the three jewels for a long time, and after death, ascended to heaven. ||145|| Vasubhuti, after wandering through many inferior births, attained human existence with great difficulty and embraced the path of asceticism. ||146|| After performing arduous austerities in his youth, he died and became a wicked astrologer god named Agniketu. ||147|| In the same Bharat Kshetra, there is a city called Aristapura, where a great king named Priyavrata ruled. ||148|| He had two queens, both possessing excellent qualities: Kanchanabha and Padmavati. ||149|| The souls of Udit and Mudit, reborn from heaven, became the beautiful sons of Queen Padmavati, named Ratnaratha and Vichitraratha. ||150|| The soul of Vasubhuti, who had become an astrologer god, was reborn as the son of King Priyavrata's other queen, Kanchanabha, named Anundhara. All three sons, born on earth, became famous for their virtues. ||151|| King Priyavrata, after entrusting his kingdom to his sons, spent six days at the Jinalaya, properly documented his deeds, and ascended to heaven. ||152||

189. The daughter of another king, named Shri-Prabha, truly the possessor of the radiance of Lakshmi, was obtained in marriage by Ratna-ratha, and also by Kanaka-amanga. ||153||

190. Having obtained her in marriage, Ratna-ratha was then filled with hatred. Anudhara, the son of Kanaka-amanga, was eager to destroy his kingdom. ||154||

191. Then Ratna-ratha, with his variegated chariot, defeated him in battle, and having inflicted five punishments, banished him. ||155||

192. Anudhara, filled with anger because of this humiliation and the enmity of a previous birth, became an ascetic, like a poison tree, wearing matted hair and bark. ||156||

193. Having enjoyed the kingdom for a long time, the two brothers, being awakened, renounced the world, performed austerities, and attained the heavenly world. ||157||

194. Possessing great radiance, they enjoyed there the pleasures fit for the gods, and then descended to the city of Siddhartha, where they were born as the sons of Kshema-kara, the king, and the great queen Vimala. ||158||

195. The first son was named Desa-bhushana, and the second, Kula-bhushana, both being very handsome. ||159||

196. While they were still young, fit to acquire knowledge, and playing at home, a learned man named Sagara-ghosha came there, wandering about. ||160||

197. The king took him into his service, and the two brothers, endowed with excellent courtesy, learned all the arts from him. ||161||

198. So engrossed were they in their studies that they did not even know their own family. Indeed, their whole mind was fixed on learning and the school. ||162||

199. After a long time, the teacher, having made the boys proficient, brought them to their father, who, seeing them worthy, honored the teacher as he deserved. ||163||

200. Then the news reached their ears that their father had summoned royal princesses for their marriage. ||164||

201. Filled with great longing, the two brothers went out of the city one day, and saw a beautiful princess sitting in a window. ||165||

202. To gain access to her, they both secretly resolved in their minds to kill each other. Then, from the mouth of the suppliant, a sound arose. ||166||

203. He left the Jinalaya after six days of excellent Sallekhana, and went to heaven. ||152||

In the Padma Purana, the glorious King Kshemakar, the husband of the pure Devi Vimala, is eternally victorious. His two sons, who are like the gods, are also victorious. ||167|| The daughter, Kamalotstava, who sits in the window, is also victorious, for she has these two brothers, who are full of excellent qualities. ||168|| Knowing that these two were their siblings, they attained supreme dispassion and began to think: ||169|| Alas! This great sin that we have desired is utterly despicable! Alas! See the terrible nature of delusion, which made us desire our own sister! ||170|| We are grieving because of our carelessness, but those who deliberately do such things are truly very bold. ||171|| Alas! This world, filled with suffering, is utterly meaningless. In it, such thoughts arise in the minds of sinful people. ||172|| A being who acts hastily due to some sin can quickly go to hell. But we, having attained knowledge and good conduct, are still desiring to go to hell. This is truly amazing! ||173|| Thinking thus, they abandoned their mother, who was fainting from grief, and their father, who was overwhelmed with affection, and took the Daigambari initiation. ||174|| Having attained the supreme wealth of tapas, these two monks, who were like the sun, wandered through the various pilgrimage sites of the world, traveling through the sky. ||175|| King Kshemakar, consumed by the fire of grief, renounced all food and attained death. ||176|| From the beginning of his existence, as mentioned earlier, he has been the father of both of us. Therefore, he always had great affection for us. ||177|| Now, after death, he has become the lord of the Garuda Kumaras, the gods of the celestial beings, known as Mahalochan, who is handsome, with extraordinary prowess. ||178|| He is agitated by the trembling of his seat, and knowing everything through his divine knowledge, he has come here and is sitting in the assembly of the Vyantara gods. ||179|| On the other hand, Anundhar, who is devoted to the practice of asceticism, has come to the city of Kaumudi, accompanied by a group of disciples. ||180|| The king there is named Sumukh, and his beloved queen, Ratavati, is a supremely beautiful woman who has attained the status of a hundred-headed queen. ||181||

193. The king had him bound and kept him under watch throughout the night. In the morning, he was publicly humiliated. ||27||

Then, consumed by the fire of humiliation, he carried the burden of great sorrow. Wandering the earth, he died and was reborn in the realms of suffering. ||12||

Then, due to the influence of his karma, he was born as a human. He was born into a low family, immersed in the mud of poverty and devoid of respect. ||213||

While he was still in the womb, his father left for a foreign land, driven by the harsh words of his wife. ||214||

When he was a child, his mother was killed during an invasion by barbarians. He was left with no family and suffered great sorrow. ||25||

Then, he became an ascetic and performed severe austerities as a child. He ascended to the luminous realm and became a god named Agniprabha. ||216||

Once, a disciple whose mind was filled with thoughts of Dharma asked the Kevali named Anantavirya, who was served by the gods, "O Lord! In this Tirtha of Manisuvrata, is there another worthy soul like you who will be the cause of crossing the ocean of existence?" ||217-218||

The Kevali Anantavirya replied, "After my liberation, there will be two Kevalis in this land of the monks: one a Deshbhushan (ornament of the land) and the other a Kulbhushan (ornament of the family). They will be the essence of the world, holders of the knowledge and vision of Kevala. By taking refuge in them, the worthy souls will cross the ocean of existence." ||219-220||

Hearing this from the mouth of the Kevali, Agniprabha, the god, went to his own abode, meditating on the words of the Kevali. ||221||

One day, knowing through his knowledge of the future, he saw both of us, the monks, present on this mountain. He said, "I declare the words of Anantavirya, the omniscient, to be false." Driven by the three poisons, he came here to cause great harm due to his past enmity. ||222-223||

Seeing you, the ultimate embodiment, and fearing the wrath of Indra, he quickly disappeared, fleeing the scene. ||224||

You, Balabhadra, and Lakshmana, the Narayana, have protected us from his attack. Therefore, with the destruction of the karma of the enemy, we have attained Kevala knowledge. ||225||

Thus, the enemies who harm the land: 1. Deshghate sati. 2-25 

Page #212:

194
Having heard the coming and going of the souls, O noble ones, of those who are enemies of living beings, let the living beings become healthy, abandoning their attachment to enmity. ||226|| Having heard the word "Mahapūta" spoken by the Kevali, the gods and demons bowed to him again and again, filled with fear and sorrow. ||227|| At that time, the lord of the Garuda, having attained supreme wealth, bowed down to the feet of the Kevali, with his head touching the ground. ||228|| He addressed Rama, the light of the Raghu dynasty, with shining earrings, his eyes spreading out with affection, his mind filled with love. ||229|| You have done a great service to my sons, therefore I am pleased with you. Ask for whatever you desire. ||230|| After a moment of thought, the son of Raghu said, "O god, if you are pleased, remember us in times of adversity." ||231|| This fruit has been obtained by the grace of serving the virtuous. We accept this, which has come out of your door. ||232|| "So be it," said the Garuda king. Then the gods blew their conch shells, and the drums, like clouds, sounded together. ||233|| Hearing this, filled with great emotion, some people took initiation, and others took on the Anuvrata. ||234|| The Deshakulbhushan, worthy of worship by the world, free from the association of all the dirt of worldly suffering, wandered through villages, towns, mountains, and forests, adorned with excellent qualities, preaching the Dharma. ||235|| The Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika, those who hear this extremely pure character of the Deshakulbhushan, the great Muni, with noble feelings, and who speak it to others, become radiant like the sun and quickly abandon their sins." ||236|| Thus ends the thirty-ninth chapter of the Padmacharita, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravi Acharya, which describes the Deshakulbhushan, the Kevali. ||39||
1. With his hand placed on his forehead. 2. The drums also. 3. Those who hear the words.

Having heard the words of the Kevali, the last embodied one, all the kings praised him with shouts of victory and bowed down to him. ||1||
The king of Vamsasthalapur, Sura Prabha, with a great heart, worshipped Rama along with Lakshmana and Sita. ||2||
The king requested Rama to enter the city, which was adorned with the brilliance of the palace towers, making the sky white. But Rama did not agree. ||3||
On the peak of the Vamsadhara mountain, which was beautiful and resembled the peak of the Himalayas, there was a flat, wide, and beautiful stone platform. ||4||
It was covered with various trees and creepers, filled with the sounds of various birds, and filled with fragrant air, various flowers and fruits. ||5||
It was adorned with many ponds filled with lotuses and water lilies, and the spring season served it with all its seasons. ||6||
The land was prepared, pure and like a mirror surface. Many pictures were made on it with dust of five colors. ||7||
Women, adorned with various emotions and graceful movements, created there, with the same five-colored dust, trees like Kunda, Ati Mukta Kalata, Maula Shri, Lotus, Juhi, Malati, Nagakesar, and Ashoka with beautiful leaves. ||8-9||
Skilled men, with excellent manners, engaged in auspicious conversations, and devoted to their master, prepared with great care, spread out clothes of the color of clouds, adorned with various pictures, and raised hundreds of dense flags. ||10-11||
Hundreds of garlands of pearls, adorned with small bells, colorful whisks, jeweled lanterns, mirrors, and many small spheres on which the rays of the sun were shining, were all placed on high arches and flags. ||12-13||
On the earth, full pots were placed according to the rules. They shone like swans in a lotus grove. ||14||

Padma Purana
Wherever Raghunandan placed his foot, there, on the earth, were established great lotuses. ||15||
Asanas and sleeping places were created there, adorned with jewels and gold, with a touch that was most pleasant. ||16||
Cloves, betel nut, and other fine things, along with excellent garments, great fragrant scents, and shining ornaments were placed everywhere. ||17||
Hundreds of kitchens, complete with all kinds of food, were built there, with separate cooking areas. ||18||
The earth was sometimes muddy with jaggery, ghee, and yogurt, and sometimes adorned with people who were eager to perform their duties, filled with respect. ||19||
Some travelers, satisfied with their food, sat there at their leisure, while others, free from worry, formed groups and delighted each other with conversation. ||20||
Here, a man adorned with a garland, his eyes intoxicated with wine, could be seen, and there, a woman, fragrant with jasmine, her mind filled with intoxication. ||21||
Here, there was drama, there, music, and there, discussions of virtue, while elsewhere, beautiful women, adorned with ornaments, played with their husbands. ||22||
Some women, adorned like celestial dancers, were seen, smiling and playful, with witty men who teased them. ||23||
Who can describe the play-grounds created for Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita? ||24||
Their bodies were adorned with various ornaments, they wore the finest garlands and garments, and they engaged in whatever play they desired. ||25||
Sita, adorned with unbroken good fortune, free from the touch of sin, played there, her mind illuminated by the teachings of the scriptures. ||26||
O King! On that Vamsagiri, Rama, the moon of the world, built thousands of shrines for the Jina masters. ||27||
They were adorned with strong pillars, their width and height were appropriate, and they were beautiful with windows, palaces, and roofs. ||28||
They had large doorways with toranas, many halls, and were surrounded by moats. They were adorned with white and beautiful flags, and had large...

197. The sounds of the mridanga, flute, and muraja were excellent, and the sounds of the cymbals, drums, conch shells, and drums were very loud. 30. There were continuous festivals with endless beautiful things. 31. The rows of Jain temples built by Rama were adorned everywhere. 32. In those temples, the five-colored Jain images, adorned with all auspicious marks, were worshipped by all beings. 33. Then, one day, the lotus-eyed king Ramachandra said to Lakshmana, "What should we do now?" 34. Time was spent happily on this excellent mountain, and the bright fame arising from the construction of Jain temples was established. 35. This king, captivated by hundreds of kinds of excellent services, said, "If we stay here, the intended work will be destroyed." 36. Although I think I have no use for these enjoyments, this lineage of excellent enjoyments does not leave me for even a moment. 37. The karma done in this world is enjoyed in the next world, and the fruits of the virtuous deeds done in the previous birth are obtained in this birth. 38. The days that are passing for us while we are living here and enjoying happiness will not come again. 39. O Lakshmana! The part of the swift-flowing rivers, the days of life, and youth that has passed is gone, it will not return. 40. It is heard that the Dandaka forest, which is exciting beyond the sound of the Karna river and difficult to reach for land-dwellers, is devoid of countries. 41. Since there is no entry of Bharata's command in that forest, we will build a house there, having obtained the seashore. 42. When Lakshmana said, "As you command," Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, all three, left that place, abandoning enjoyments like Indra. 43. The king Suraprabha of Vansasthavilpur went a long way to escort them with his army. Rama and Lakshmana were able to return him with great difficulty. After that, he returned to his city, bearing sorrow.

In the Padma Purana,
This is also a high, supreme mountain, the glorious Nitamba, with many peaks. It is adorned with a row of Jain houses, shining with their beautiful towers. ||44||
Because Rama built the most excellent temples of the Jina on that mountain, its lineage was destroyed, and that mountain, shining like the sun, became known as Ramagiri. ||45||
Thus ends the fortieth chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the Arsha, which describes Ramagiri. ||40||
1. It shone with its towers.

The Forty-Fourth Chapter

Then, the glorious Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sita, who were constantly enjoying pleasures, crossed many countries filled with cities and villages, and entered a great forest teeming with various kinds of animals. ||1-2||

They entered this dense forest where no path could be found, not a single place was inhabited by noble men, even for the forest-dwelling Bhils it was difficult to traverse, it was filled with winds, dense with various trees and creepers, with extremely uneven terrain, it seemed deep with the darkness of caves, and where waterfalls and many rivers flowed. ||3-4||

In that forest, they walked slowly, only a krosha at a time, due to Janaki. Thus, fearless and eager to play, the two brothers reached the Karna-rava river. ||5||

Whose banks were extremely beautiful, filled with abundant grass, even, long and wide, and possessed a pleasant touch. ||6||

The mountains near the Karna-rava river, were adorned with trees on its banks, which were not very tall, but whose shade was very dense, and which were filled with fruits and flowers. ||7||

Considering this forest and river both to be extremely beautiful, they sat down in the pleasant shade of a tree, accompanied by Sita. ||8||

After staying there for a while, and taking a dip in the beautiful banks, they engaged in the delightful sport of water-play, that is, they entered the water and played in it. ||9||

Then, while engaging in pleasant conversation with each other, they all enjoyed the ripe, sweet fruits and flowers of the forest, as they wished. ||10||

There, Lakshmana quickly made all kinds of utensils and useful things from various kinds of mud, bamboo, and leaves. ||11||

In all these utensils, the princess Sita prepared delicious and beautiful fruits and fragrant rice dishes of the forest. ||12||

One day, while observing the guests, Sita suddenly saw, coming towards them, Sugupti and Gupti, who were enjoying pleasures, and who had beautiful appearances, their bodies enveloped in a veil of grace. ||13|| 

Page #218:

Two monks were seen. The monks were wandering in the sky, their bodies were filled with a group of radiance, they were very beautiful, they were endowed with the three knowledges of Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi, they were the holders of the great vows, they were endowed with supreme penance, their minds were devoid of evil desires, they had fasted for a month, they were brave and courageous, they were endowed with virtues, they were the holders of auspicious conduct, they provided joy to the eyes like the moon and Mercury, and they were endowed with the prescribed conduct. ||13 - 16|| Thereafter, Sita, whose eyes were shining with the burden of joy and whose body was trembling with excitement, said to Rama, "O best of men! Look, look, these Digambar monks, whose bodies are becoming thin due to penance and who seem extremely tired." ||17-18|| Rama, in confusion, said, "My dear! O virtuous one! O learned one! O beautiful one! O ornament of virtues! Where did you see the pair of Nirgranth monks? Where did you see them?" ||19|| "That pair, whose sight, O beautiful one, destroys the long-accumulated sins of the devotees in an instant." ||20|| Upon Rama saying this, Sita said in confusion, "These are they, these are they." At that time, Rama was filled with some anxiety. ||21|| Thereafter, seeing the two monks whose gaze was fixed on the earth, whose walk was extremely peaceful, and whose bodies were devoid of carelessness, the couple, Rama and Sita, stood up, went forward, praised them, and bowed to them, thus making them like mountains for the spring of the river of merit. ||22-23|| Sita, whose body was pure and who was endowed with great faith, served food to the two monks along with her husband. ||24|| That food was made from fresh and beautiful ghee, milk, and other products made from them, such as mawa, produced from cows and buffaloes born in the forest. ||25|| It was made from dates, figs, mangoes, coconuts, juicy berries, and fruits like bhilma. ||26|| Thus, the monks performed their Parana with various types of food items endowed with scriptural purity. They

The Muni Rama, accompanied by his beloved, was engaged in serving the two Munis, his face adorned with the garland of all the scriptures. 28
At that time, unseen drums sounded in the sky, and a fragrant breeze, pleasing to the sense of smell, blew gently. 29
The sweet sound of the Devas, chanting "Sadhu, Sadhu," filled the air, and the sky rained down flowers of five colors. 30
The divine, multi-colored, radiant rain of jewels, filling the sky, was a result of the power of giving alms. 31
Then, in the same forest, a large, heavy vulture perched on the top of a dense, tall tree. 32
Seeing the two Munis, filled with extraordinary qualities, the vulture remembered his many past lives, due to the influence of his karma. He began to think: 33
"In my previous life, though I was wise, I became careless and did not perform the austerities that were appropriate for a human life. Therefore, I, the unwise, am cursed." 34
"Oh, heart, why are you grieving now? I have come to this wretched womb and am immersed in sinful activities. What can I do?" 35
"Driven by those who call themselves friends but are actually wicked enemies, I have always abandoned the jewel of Dharma." 36
"Remembering the great sins I have committed, I am burning now, enveloped in the darkness of delusion, despite hearing the teachings of the Gurus." 37
"There is no use in thinking about this any further. There is no other path for me in this world to end my suffering. 38
"I will seek refuge in these two Munis, who bring happiness to all beings. Through them, I will surely attain the ultimate goal." 39
Thus, overwhelmed by the sorrow of remembering his past lives and filled with joy at the sight of the great Munis, the vulture, with tears in his eyes and a humble demeanor, fluttered his wings and descended from the top of the tree. 40
Even the Nagas and lions fled in terror at the sound of the drums. How could the lowly birds not flee? 41

The Munis were free from the greed that is the food for the mind. 27 

Page #220:
---------------------------
202
"O Mother, see the audacity of this sinful vulture!" Thus, thinking, Sita, with a mind filled with anger, spoke harshly. 43
Even though she tried to stop him, the bird, with great enthusiasm, was eager to drink the water from the Muni's feet. 44
By the grace of the foot-water, his body instantly became like a mountain of jewels, adorned with radiant light. 45
His wings were like gold, his feet like lapis lazuli, his body shone with various jewels, and his beak was like coral. 46
Seeing himself transformed, he was overjoyed and, releasing a sweet sound, began to dance. 47
The sound of the divine drum was like his own voice, beautiful and powerful. 48
With joyful eyes, he circled the two Munis and, having danced, shone like a peacock in the rainy season. 49
Having performed the Parana according to the rules, the Munis, adorned like lapis lazuli, sat on the stone platform. 50
The vulture, with eyes like ruby, his wings folded, bowed at their feet, hands clasped in reverence, and sat comfortably. 51
Seeing the bird, blazing with light like fire, Rama, with eyes like a blooming lotus, was filled with wonder. 52
Bowing at the feet of the Munis, adorned with virtue and character, he asked the vulture, "O Lord, this creature was once extremely deformed. How did he become radiant like gold and jewels in an instant? 53-54
This vulture, impure, a devourer of all flesh, with a wicked mind, why is he sitting peacefully at your feet?" 55
The Muni, named Sugupti, said, "O King, in the past, this land was filled with various settlements, a beautiful and vast kingdom. 56

The Fortieth Chapter

Adorned with cities, villages, caravanserais, monasteries, cave-temples, drums, and war-trumpets, there was a very large and beautiful country. [56-57] In this country, there was a beautiful city called Karnakundala, where this supremely powerful king resided. He was endowed with great valor, a destroyer of enemies, a great dignitary, and a master of all means. [58-59] O Raghunandan! This king, who was full of faith in Dharma, understood the scriptures that promote evil, and he wore them, as if he had churned water for the sake of ghee. [60] The queen of King Dandaka was a great devotee of the wandering ascetics, because she had received great pleasures from the masters of the wandering ascetics. [61] King Dandaka was under the control of his queen, and so he also sought refuge in her direction. What do men not do when they are intent on captivating the hearts of women? [62] One day, the king went out of the city, and there he saw a sage with his arms hanging down, endowed with the wealth of detachment, and whose mind was absorbed in meditation. [63] The king, who had a heart as hard as stone, had a dead black snake, whose body was covered with poisonous saliva, placed around the neck of the sage. [64] "Until this snake is removed, I will not contract my yoga," vowed the sage, and he remained in that place. [65] After many nights had passed, the king, who was passing by the same path, saw the great sage in the same state of meditation. [66] At that time, a man was removing the snake from the neck of the sage. The king, attracted by the simplicity of the sage, went to him and asked the man who was removing the snake, "What is this?" In reply, the man said, "O King! See, some man who is seeking hell has placed this snake around the neck of this sage who is absorbed in meditation. [67-68] Due to the contact of this snake, his body has become dark, sorrowful, unsightly, and extremely terrifying." [69] Seeing the sage in that state, without any resistance, the king bowed down and begged his forgiveness, and then he went to his place. [70] From that time on, the king became devoted to the great Digambara monks, and he removed all the troubles and hardships of the monks. [71]

204
In the Padma Purana, knowing the king's affair with the wandering ascetic, the queen desired to do this. ||72|| Abandoning her love for life, and motivated by the suffering of others, she again sought the company of the Nirgrantha Muni. ||73|| Knowing her actions, the king was filled with anger. Remembering the slander of the Nirgrantha Munis by his ministers and others, ||74|| motivated by the hatred of the ascetics, he ordered his servants to crush all the Munis in a mortar. ||75|| The group of ascetics, along with their leader, were crushed in the mortar by the wicked men, and met their end. ||76|| At that time, one Muni was away, and was returning to the city. A compassionate man stopped him, saying, "O Nirgrantha! O Digambara! Do not enter the city in your former Nirgrantha garb, or you will be crushed in the mortar. Flee from here quickly." ||77-78|| The king, in his anger, has crushed all the Nirgrantha Munis in the mortar. Do not meet the same fate. Protect your body, which is the refuge of Dharma. ||79|| Then, pierced by the sorrow of the death of the entire community, the Muni stood motionless like a pillar, his consciousness obscured. ||80|| Then, from the cave of peace, the lion of anger emerged, driven by hundreds of sorrows, from the mountain of Nirgrantha Munis. ||81|| The sky was filled with the red glow of his eyes, like the fire of the ashoka tree, as if twilight had descended. ||82|| The Muni, burning with anger, sweat poured from his entire body, reflecting the image of the world. ||83|| Then, from his mouth, a fire emerged, like the fire of time, very crooked and vast, with the sound "Ha". ||84|| That fire, continuously burning, consumed the entire sky, without any fuel. ||85||

The Forty-First Chapter

205. Are the worlds being consumed by meteors? Are the celestial beings falling? Has the time of the great destruction arrived? Are the fire gods enraged? 86. Alas, mother! What is this? This heat is unbearable. It seems as if the eyes are being gouged out by large, sharp pincers. 87. This formless sky is making a terrible sound. It is like a forest of bamboo, ablaze, ready to consume life. 88. As long as this extremely agitated sound reverberates in the world, this fire will reduce the entire land to ashes. 89. Neither the inner chambers, nor the land, nor the cities, nor the mountains, nor the rivers, nor the forests, nor the living beings remained. 90. The great penance, accumulated by the sage with great fervor, was consumed by the fire of anger. What else could remain? 91. This Dandaka region was ruled by Indra, the king of the gods. Therefore, even today, this place is known as Dandaka. 92. After a long time, the land regained its beauty. Trees, mountains, and rivers appeared. 93. Due to the influence of that sage, this forest became a source of fear even for the gods, let alone the Vidyadharas. 94. Later, this forest became filled with lions, tigers, and other ferocious animals, various kinds of birds, and abundant wild grains. 95. Even today, hearing the roar of this forest fire, people tremble, remembering the past event. 96. After wandering in the world for a long time, Dandaka, filled with sorrow, has attained the state of a householder and found joy in this forest. 97. Seeing us both, who have come to this forest with great devotion, he has attained the memory of his past life due to the destruction of his evil deeds. 98. Look, Dandaka, the king who was once endowed with supreme power, has become like this due to his evil deeds. 99. Knowing the tasteless fruit of evil deeds, why not engage in Dharma and renounce evil? 100.

## Chapter 206 of the Padma Purana

**Example:** Even an external cause can lead to peace. What to say if one remembers one's own faults? || 101 ||

Addressing the vulture, the sage said, "O twice-born, do not be afraid now, do not cry. What is destined to happen, who can change it?" || 102 ||

"Be patient, be fearless, let go of your trembling, be happy. Look, where is this great forest? And where is Rama with Sita?" || 103 ||

"Where is our downfall? And where is your awakening, experiencing sorrow for the sake of your own well-being? Such is the nature of karma." || 104 ||

"This world is extremely diverse due to the diversity of karma. I speak as I have experienced, heard, and seen." || 105 ||

To explain to the bird, knowing the intention of Rama, the sage Sugupti spoke of his initiation and the cause of peace. || 106 ||

He said, "In the city of Varanasi, there was a famous king named Achal. His wife was Giri Devi, adorned with jewels of virtue." || 107 ||

"One day, a sage named Trigupta, known for his virtuous name and pure actions, entered her house for food." || 108 ||

"Giri Devi, holding the utmost faith in him, following proper rituals, satisfied him with the best food, abandoning all other tasks." || 109 ||

"After the sage had finished eating, she bowed her head at his feet and, under the guise of another matter, asked about the birth of her sons." || 110 ||

"She said, 'O master, will my dwelling in this house be fruitful or not? Please make me certain and bring me joy.'" || 111 ||

"Though he was the keeper of three secrets, the sage, due to the queen's devotion, broke his vow of secrecy and said, 'You will have two beautiful sons.'" || 112 ||

"Following the sage Trigupta's instructions, two sons were born. Their parents named them Sugupti and Gupta." || 113 ||

"Both sons were knowledgeable in all arts, adorned with the fortune of youth, delighted in various emotions, and were greatly loved by the people." || 114 ||

At the same time, this other story occurred: In the city of Gandhavati, the king's priest, Soma, had two sons... || 115 ||

The Forty-First Chapter

207. Suketa and Agniketa, the two sons of the Purohita, were deeply attached to each other. Suketa had already married and taken a wife. 

116. Suketa was saddened, thinking, "Now that my wife has come, my brother and I will have to sleep separately."

117. Suketa, inspired by auspicious deeds, took refuge in the order of the Shramanas under the guidance of Anantavirya.

118. Agniketa, deeply distressed by his brother's departure, became a severe ascetic in Varanasi, engrossed in contemplation of Dharma.

119. Bound by affection, Suketa, upon hearing of his brother's ascetic life, decided to go and enlighten him.

120. As he was about to leave, his Guru said, "Suketa, you must tell your brother this story, which will surely calm him down."

121. "What story, my Lord?" asked Suketa. The Guru replied, "Your brother, filled with evil thoughts, will engage in a debate with you."

122. "While you two are debating, a beautiful maiden with a radiant complexion, accompanied by three other women, will arrive at the Ganges."

123. "She will arrive in the last watch of the day, adorned in colorful garments. Recognize her by these signs and tell your brother, 'If you have any knowledge of Dharma, tell me what good or bad fortune awaits this maiden.'"

124-125. "Then, the ignorant ascetic, ashamed, will say, 'Well, you know, tell me.' You, with certainty, should say, "In this very city, there lives a wealthy merchant named Pravara. This is his daughter, known as Ruchi."

126-127. "This unfortunate girl will die three days from now. She will be reborn as a goat in the village of Kambar, belonging to a merchant named Vilasa."

128-129. "A wolf will kill the goat, and she will be reborn as a cow in the same household. Then, she will be reborn as a daughter of the same Vilasa. This Vilasa is the maternal uncle of the girl's father."

130. "So be it," said Suketa, bowing to his Guru with reverence and joy, and proceeded towards the hermitage of the ascetics. 

Page #226:
---------------------------
208
Padmapurana
As instructed by the Guru, Suketa saw the girl and told his brother Agniketa. Thus, the whole story came before Agniketa, i.e., it turned out to be true. ||131||
Then, after death, that girl was born as the daughter of Vilasa, named Vidhura. The wealthy man named Pravara requested her and obtained her, the beautiful one. ||132||
When the time for marriage arrived, Agniketa told Pravara that this girl was his daughter in a previous birth. ||133||
Saying this, he also narrated all those births to Vilasa, the girl's present father. Hearing those births, the girl remembered her past lives. ||134||
Frightened by the world, she desired to take initiation. On the other hand, Pravara thought that Vilasa was not marrying his daughter due to some deceit. Thus, Pravara, harboring a wicked intention, accused Vilasa in the assembly of their father. But in the end, Pravara lost, the girl attained the path of liberation, and Agniketa became a Digambara monk. ||135-136||
Hearing the story, we also became detached and took Jain initiation in the presence of the Muni Raja named Anantavirya. ||137||
Thus, due to the influence of the deluded, many wicked conducts arise in the world, which give rise to progeny. ||138||
This being, according to its own actions, obtains mother, father, friends, wife, son, and happiness-sorrow, etc., in birth after birth. ||139||
Hearing this, the vulture became extremely frightened by the sorrows of the world and started making sounds repeatedly, desiring to take refuge in Dharma. ||140||
Then, the Muni Raja said, "O Bhadra! Do not be afraid. Take vows now, so that you do not obtain this progeny of sorrows again." ||141||
Become completely peaceful, do not cause pain to any being, abandon falsehood, theft, and another's wife, or else, practice complete celibacy, be endowed with excellent forgiveness, abandon night-time meals, be endowed with good conduct, with great effort, keep the Jina in your heart day and night, practice the rules of fasting, etc., according to your ability, be free from carelessness, and control your senses. ||142-144||

Page #227:
---------------------------
209
The forty-first chapter: Being free from carelessness, be eager in the pursuit of the Self.  Do what is right, be devoted to the virtuous. ||145||

Thus spoken to, the bird, with folded hands, bowed its head repeatedly, making a sweet sound, and received the Muni's instruction. ||146||

"This devotee, with a humble soul, has been born to bring us joy," said Sita, smiling, and touched him with her hands. ||147||

"It is now proper for you to protect what has been spoken by the virtuous. This ascetic, with a peaceful mind, where will this bird-bearer go?" ||148||

"In this dense forest, frequented by cruel beings, you must always protect this bird of right vision." ||149||

Then, receiving the Guru's words, Sita, filled with great affection, took upon herself the care of his protection. ||150||

With hands as soft as leaves, she touched him. Sita shone like Vinata, touching Garuda. ||151||

The two Nirgrantha masters, praised and saluted, went to their own place, their journey being a source of great benefit to many. ||152||

As they flew up, the two great Munis shone like two great waves of the ocean of charity and righteousness. ||153||

Meanwhile, Lakshmana, having subdued a maddened elephant and mounted it, came rushing, hearing the sound. ||154||

Seeing a great heap of jewels and gold, like a mountain, with a rainbow emanating from it, and its many-colored rays, Lakshmana, with his lotus-like eyes wide open, and filled with great curiosity, was informed of all the events by Rama, who was delighted. ||155-156||

The bird, who had received the three jewels, and who diligently followed all the Muni's words, did not go anywhere without Rama and Sita. ||157||

Remembering the Muni's instructions, and being constantly reminded by Sita in the Anuvrata Ashrama, the bird roamed the earth, delighting in the path of Rama and Lakshmana. ||158||

Page #228:
---------------------------
210
Behold the generosity of dharma in the Padma Purana, where a bird, once like a leaf of a vegetable, became like a lotus in this very birth. ||159||
Previously, he was foul-smelling, repulsive, and a consumer of many kinds of flesh. Now, he has become beautiful, like water in a golden pitcher. ||160||
His form was sometimes like a flame of fire, sometimes like a sapphire, sometimes with the radiance of gold, and sometimes like a green gem. ||161||
He sat before Rama and Lakshmana, a master of sweet words, and enjoyed the excellent food prepared by Sita. ||162||
His body was anointed with sandalwood, adorned with golden bells, and he wore a head adorned with a crown of radiant gems. ||163||
Because his body was adorned with radiant, gem-studded, golden locks, he was affectionately called "Jatayu" by Rama and the others. ||164||
Seeing him, with his graceful gait, surpassing even the swan, adorned with beautiful ornaments, other birds were terrified and astonished. ||165||
He bowed three times a day, with Sita, to the Jinas, the Siddhas, and the Yogis, filled with devotion. ||166||
Sita, compassionate and devoted to dharma, was greatly pleased and always protected him with care. ||167||
Enjoying the fruits of his good deeds, he savored the pure, nectar-like fruits, and drank the finest water in the forest, always living righteously. ||168||
When Sita, the daughter of Janaka, sang songs of dharma, accompanied by the sound of the cymbals, and her husband and brother-in-law harmonized with her voice, Jatayu, radiant like the sun, danced with joy. ||169||
Thus ends the forty-first chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the sage Ravisha, called the "Jatayu Story." ||41||
1. Radiant like the sun.

In the forty-second chapter, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sita, became endowed with jewels and gold due to the effect of the offering of water. ||1|| Thereafter, they mounted a golden chariot adorned with many bells and chains, supported by excellent pillars, a platform, and a central chamber, elevated, with windows adorned with large pearl garlands, decorated with small spheres, mirrors, tassels, and crescent moons, filled with beds, seats, musical instruments, clothes, and fragrances, drawn by four elephants, resembling an aerial chariot. ||2-4|| Riding this chariot, free from obstacles, they roamed with Jatayu in the delightful forest, captivating the hearts of virtuous people. ||5|| They stayed in this enchanting forest, indulging in their desired pastimes, sometimes for a day, sometimes for a fortnight, and sometimes for a month. ||6|| Desiring to dwell here and there, they wandered like a bull seeking fresh grass. ||7|| They gradually traversed many high and low regions, filled with deep ravines and towering trees. ||8|| Roaming freely like fearless lions, they entered the heart of the Dandaka forest, a place that instilled fear in the hearts of timid people. ||9|| This forest was adorned with diverse peaks resembling the Himalayas, beautiful waterfalls and rivers resembling pearl necklaces. ||10|| It was filled with banyan trees, tamarind trees, jujube trees, bel trees, silk cotton trees, banana trees, resin trees, walnut trees, cedar trees, dhau trees, kadamba trees, tilak trees, lodh trees, ashoka trees, jamun trees of blue and red hues, rose trees, mango trees, amla trees, champak trees, karnicar trees, teak trees, palm trees, priyangu trees, saptaparna trees, tamala trees, nagakesar trees, nandi trees, koha trees, bakouli trees, sandalwood trees, neem trees, bhojpatra trees, hingulak trees, banyan trees, white and black aguru trees, kund trees, rambha trees, ingua trees, padmak trees, muchakunda trees, kutila trees,

Rajputri! Where are you coming from and where are you going?" ||30|| The forest seemed to be eager to see the extremely clear lakes, filled with white, blue, and red lotuses. ||31|| The forest, with its branches bent under the weight of fruits, seemed to be sighing with joy, with the fragrant wind. ||32||

Then, seeing the beautiful forest, Rama said to Janaka's daughter, whose eyes were like blooming lotuses, "My dear, look! These mountains, with their vines, bushes, and nearby trees, seem to be like families."

"See this Priyangu creeper clinging to the chest of the Vakula tree. It seems like a loving woman clinging to her husband's chest."

"This Madhavi creeper, with its swaying leaves, seems to be touching the mango tree out of affection."

"Oh Sita! This elephant, whose eyes are drowsy, is being urged on by the female elephant, and whose cluster of buds has been emptied by the bees, is entering the lotus forest."

**Verse 37**

He, who, hearing the sound of a chariot, wakes up for a moment, abandoning his sleep, and, looking at it with his sidelong glance, yawns slowly and then remains in the same position."

**Verse 40**

**Page 213**

It seemed as if Rama was greeting them with great respect, and the fragrant air was so beautiful, as if it were releasing breaths of joy.

Then, seeing the beautiful forest, which was like the Saumanasa forest, Rama said to Sita, whose eyes were like blooming lotuses, "My dear, look! These trees, with their vines, bushes, and nearby trees, seem to be like families."

"See this Priyangu creeper clinging to the chest of the Vakula tree. It seems like a loving woman clinging to her husband's chest."

In the Padma Purana,
Here, the sky is adorned with a multitude of geese, their feet adorned with the creations of various water-dwelling beings. The flock of stars, bound by love, sometimes engage in fierce quarrels due to excessive intoxication. ||69||
This sandy shore, adorned with the footprints of flocks of birds, resembles your hips, O beloved! Your face, radiant like the moon, has banished the darkness of the demons. ||70||
This is the Mattamayoora Chanda, like the river, adorned with many beautiful waves, and the beautiful, expansive, and virtuous Subhadra, adorned with many beautiful qualities, obtained the beautiful and expansive Bharat Chakravarti. Similarly, this river, adorned with many beautiful birds, and beautiful waves like eyebrows, obtained the beautiful and expansive ocean. ||71||
These banks, O beloved, adorned with fruits and flowers, and filled with various birds, are continuous and resemble clouds filled with water. They seem to have come to this riverbank to create joy for us both. ||72||
Thus, when Rama spoke with words of great beauty and meaning, Sita, filled with joy, said with respect. ||73||
O beloved! This river is filled with pure water, adorned with waves, and filled with flocks of swans and other birds. Your mind is also drawn to it.

The Twenty-Fourth Chapter
The Lament of the Separated One
Hearing those words, the moon of the Raghu lineage, Rama, followed by his brother, accepted the invitation and went from his chariot-dwelling to the delightful earth. ||75||
First, Lakshmana, the lord of Lakshmi, bathed to relieve the fatigue caused by the new elephant's journey through the forest paths. Then, he gathered a collection of various sweet, excellent, tender leaves and flowers, and performed the appropriate service. ||76||
(?) Afterwards, Lakshmana, whose mind was a mine of various virtues, desired to play in the water with Rama. He would sometimes climb onto the groups of trees that were advancing in the flow of the water and jump into the water, sometimes he would perform unparalleled feats, and sometimes he would use the best methods of various water sports. ||77||
The earth-circle, adorned with rings of foam, with waves rising in garlands, filled with crushed white, blue, and red lotus petals, emitting a sweet sound, and served by solitary gatherings, seemed as if the river-woman was enjoying herself with the moon of the Raghu lineage, Ramachandra. ||78||
The lamenting one, having submerged herself in the water, went far away, hidden in the lotus forest. Then, upon learning of this, Sita quickly went to him and began to play. ||79||
The swans and other birds, who were previously playing in the water with their mates and whose wings were adorned with pollen from their wanderings in the lotus forest, now quickly came to the shores, making various sweet sounds, abandoning their attachments to various activities, and with their minds free from distractions, they watched the excellent water sports of Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita.

Padma Purana
The sound of the water drum, played with the hands, was very sweet, beautiful, and varied, even though it was played with a rough touch. Raghupati, accompanied by his beloved, played the water drum with a beautiful song. ||8||
Lakshmana, who was devoted to his brother and carried a bow that echoed the sound of the ocean, circled around him. Although he was very fast, he was also very skilled in walking gracefully, and he was focused on his brother's virtues. ||83||
Rama, with his pure and playful nature, enjoyed playing in the water, bringing joy to the deer on the shore. Raghupati, accompanied by his brother and wife, was about to go to the shore, like an elephant king. ||84||
They made their home in the forest, using the best things that nature provided. They lived happily in the Dandaka forest, where the sun was blocked by the canopy of vines, like gods in a storybook. ||85||
Then Sita's husband, with a calm mind, spoke. He was sitting near Sita, who was adorned with flowers on her head. ||86||
"Brother, there are many different trees here, full of delicious fruits. There are clear rivers and pavilions made of vines." ||87||
"This great mountain, called Dandaka, is full of many jewels and has many different regions suitable for playing." ||88||
"Let us build a beautiful city near this mountain and keep many buffaloes that are born in the forest." ||89||
"Let us build our home in this beautiful forest, where it is difficult for others to come, because I am very happy here." ||90||
"Go quickly and bring our mothers, who are attached to us and are constantly consumed by sorrow, along with all our relatives and family who are devoted to our well-being." ||91||
This is right, because even animals understand the beautiful actions of humans who have gentle hearts. ||80-81||
After that, Rama played the water drum with his hands, singing a beautiful song with Sita by his side. The sound of the water drum was sweeter, more beautiful, and more varied than the sound of a mridanga. ||82||
At that time, Rama's mind was absorbed in playing in the water, and he was eager to perform various clever actions. Lakshmana, filled with brotherly love and carrying a bow that echoed the sound of the ocean, circled around him. Although Lakshmana was very fast, he was also very skilled in walking gracefully, and he was focused on his brother's virtues. ||83||
In this way, Rama, with his pure and playful nature, enjoyed playing in the water, bringing joy to the deer on the shore, along with his brother and wife. Like an elephant king, he was about to go to the shore. ||84||
After bathing, they ate food made from the best things that grew in the forest. They sat happily in the Dandaka forest, where the sun was blocked by the canopy of vines, like gods in a storybook, telling many stories. ||85||
Then Sita's husband, with a calm mind, spoke. He was sitting near Sita, who was adorned with flowers on her head. ||86||
"Brother, there are many different trees here, full of delicious fruits. There are clear rivers and pavilions made of vines." ||87||
"This great mountain, called Dandaka, is full of many jewels and has many different regions suitable for playing." ||88||
"Let us build a beautiful city near this mountain and keep many buffaloes that are born in the forest." ||89||
"Let us build our home in this beautiful forest, where it is difficult for others to come, because I am very happy here." ||90||

"Do not go, my dear, do not go! This is not right, my mind does not attain purity this way." ||12||

"I will go myself when the season arrives. You, being careful, will stay here with Sita." ||13||

Then, Lakshmana, having heard Rama's first words, was about to leave with great humility, but upon hearing the second, he stopped. At that time, Rama, whose heart was filled with love, said again, "The scorching summer season, marked by the blazing sun, has passed. Now, this extremely dreadful rainy season has arrived." ||14-15||

These clouds, filled with lightning, are darkening the directions, roaring like the churning ocean, and moving like the swift Anjanagiri mountain. ||16||

Just as the gods shower down a treasure of jewels at the birth of the Jina, these clouds, embodying the gods, continuously cover the sky and release water, showering rain. ||17||

These great clouds, with their loud roars, are making the mountains even higher with their mighty streams. They are moving in the sky, adorned with lightning, and are filled with the love of the moment. ||18||

These white clouds, driven by the swift wind, are wandering here and there, like the youthful hearts of unrestrained men. ||19||

Just as a wealthy man, without discerning the worthiness of the recipient, gives his wealth to the unworthy, this cloud, leaving the land of crops, is showering rain on the mountain. ||20||

**Malini Vritta**

"The rivers are flowing with great speed, the earth is difficult to traverse due to the excessive mud, and the cool, sharp wind, fragrant with the scent of water, is blowing. Therefore, my dear, your departure is not appropriate." ||21||

Thus, Padma says to Kekayi's son,
"You are the master, whatever you say, I will do. In this way, with various sweet stories, they spent the rainy season, devoid of the sun's presence, happily in their beautiful abode." || 102 ||
Thus ends the forty-second chapter, titled "Dandakaranya Nivaasa", in the Padmacharita, a narrative known as Aarsha, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. || 42 ||

Then, having conquered the autumn season with its moon-like rays, the cloud-mass, Vishnu-like, spread its dominion over the entire world. ||1||

The trees, adorned with blooming flowers, stood as the finest ornaments, their hearts filled with affection, welcoming the arrival of the season. ||2||

The sky, freed from the grime of the clouds, shone with a brilliance like that of polished collyrium, as if cleansed by water for a long time. ||3||

The elephant of the rainy season, having showered the earth, the goddess of wealth, with rain-laden clouds, had vanished somewhere, leaving behind a trail of lightning. ||4||

The swarms of bees, after a long time, reached the abode of the lotus, and, engaged in sweet conversation, settled down in comfort. ||5||

The rivers, filled with clear water, their banks gradually submerged, attained supreme beauty, having found their beloved, the autumn season. ||6||

The forests, freed from the harsh winds of the rainy season, after a long time, settled down in comfort, appearing as if they were united in sleep. ||7||

The lakes, adorned with lotuses, engaged in conversation, as it were, with the trees that had sprung up on their banks, accompanied by the sounds of birds. ||8||

The night, adorned with a clear sky, like a pure garment, and adorned with various flowers, was like a woman wearing a moon-like ornament, having found her husband, the auspicious time. ||9||

The wind, its body turned pale by the pollen of the Ketaki flowers, blew gently, intoxicating the women. ||10||

At this time, when the whole world was filled with joy and enthusiasm, Lakshmana, the lion-like, fearless, and mighty, having received permission from his elder brother Rama, looked towards the directions, and, at some point, wandered alone near the Dandaka forest. ||11-12||

He then smelled a divine fragrance carried by the gentle breeze. Inhaling it, he wondered to himself, "Whose fragrance could this be, so captivating?" ||13|| 

Page #242:
---------------------------
"Is this fragrance from these trees bearing blooming flowers, or from my body, which rests on a bed of flowers?" (14) "Or is Rama, along with Sita, residing above? Or has some god arrived here?" (15) Then, the king of Magadha, Shrenik, asked the great sage, "O Bhagavan, whose fragrance was it that caused Lakshmana to be astonished?" (16) Then, the Ganadhara, who knew the activities of the world, spoke, like the sun dispelling the darkness of doubt and the wind blowing away the dust of sin. (17) "When the second Jina, Shri Ajitanatha, was in Samavasarana, a Vidyadhara named Meghavahana, terrified, sought refuge in the Lord. At that time, the lord of the Rakshasas, the wise Mahaabhima, out of compassion, gave a boon to Meghavahana, saying, (18-19) "O Meghavahana! There is a vast Rakshasa island in the southern ocean, on which there is a mountain called Trikut. Go there, without worry, and reside on that Trikut mountain. There, taking refuge in the platform of Jambudvipa, the Rakshasas have established a city called Lanka in the southern direction. You reside there." "O Vidyadhara! Along with this, listen to another secret, confidential matter. The Bharat Kshetra, related to Jambudvipa, is situated in the southern direction. Taking refuge on the northern bank of the salt ocean, there is a natural place, situated within the earth, which is eight yojanas wide. Entering the great gate, situated at the foot of the Dandaka mountain, through the arches of jewels, (20-25) you will see a city called Alankaroday, which is the best and most beautiful. It is situated in the land of the hundred Dharmas, a divine land. It is adorned with a multitude of rays of various kinds of jewels, and is capable of causing wonder even to the inhabitants of the heavens. It is inaccessible to those who fly in the sky, and is devoid of Vidyadharas. It is full of all kinds of desirable qualities, and is filled with various kinds of buildings." (26-27) "If, at any time, you are attacked by the Parachakra, take refuge in that fort and reside there without fear." (28) Thus, the Vidyadhara boy, who was spoken to by Mahaabhima, went there. From him, many noble descendants were born in Lanka. (29)

**225**

To have faith in things as they are, is the greatest happiness. To accept things that are falsely conceived, is the greatest sorrow. ||30||

The wise should understand the difference between the *Vidhyadharas* and the Gods, just as there is a difference between a sesame seed and a mountain, due to their strength, brilliance, and other qualities. ||31||

Just as there is a difference between mud and sandalwood, and between stone and gem, so too is there a difference between the *Vidhyadharas* and the Gods. ||32||

The *Vidhyadharas* are born after experiencing the pain of gestation, due to the influence of their karma. They are only holders of knowledge. They are born on the *Kshetra-Vijayardha* mountain and in their respective families, and they move in the sky, hence they are called *Khecharas*. But the nature of the Gods is beautiful. ||33-34||

The Gods are beautiful and pure, free from gestation, devoid of flesh, bones, and sweat, and have eyes that never blink. ||35||

They are free from old age and disease, eternally youthful, endowed with great brilliance, oceans of happiness and good fortune, naturally knowledgeable, with eyes of *Avadhi* knowledge, capable of assuming any form at will, courageous, valiant, and free to move as they please. ||36-37||

O King! The *Vidhyadharas* who reside in Lanka are neither Gods nor demons, but they protect the demon realm, hence they are called demons. ||38||

Their lineage continues through many eons, and according to that lineage, many *Sagara* (oceans) of time have passed. ||39||

After the passing of many praiseworthy and excellent *Vidhyadhara* kings, like the *Rakshasas*, Ravana was born in the same lineage, as the ruler of the three realms. ||40||

He had a sister named *Duka*, whose beauty had no equal on earth. She married the mighty *Kharadushan*. ||41||

The mighty *Kharadushan* was the trusted commander of fourteen thousand men. ||42||

He was as generous as the *Dikkusara* (God of the directions), and his abode was the city of *Alankarapur*, situated in the heart of the earth. ||43||

He had two sons, *Shambuka* and *Sunda*. He was also related to *Dashgriva*, and he gained great respect on earth. ||44||

It was from the *Vidhyadhara* child who went to Lanka, as told by the demon king, that many excellent descendants were born. ||29||

Even though he was being stopped by the gurus, Shambuka, seeing the noose of death, entered the terrifying forest with the Suryahaas sword. ||45||  O King! He was eager to obtain the Suryahaas sword, following the prescribed conduct. He was a Brahmachari, a conqueror of senses, a pure soul, and a one-meal eater. ||46||  "Whoever comes before my sight without having served his purpose, shall be slain by me," saying this, he entered the forest on the Vansasthal mountain. ||47||  He was situated in the Dandakaranya forest, at the end of the river Krauncharava, on the northern bank of the ocean. ||48||  After twelve years, the Suryahaas sword appeared, which could be obtained after staying for seven days, otherwise, it would kill the seeker. ||49||  Driven by her love for her son, Kaikesi's daughter (Chandranakha) kept coming to see him. She saw the Suryahaas sword, which had appeared at that moment, presided over by the gods. ||50||  Chandranakha, with a happy face, told her husband Kharadushana, "O King! My son will return after circumambulating Mount Meru in three days, as his vow is not yet completed." ||51-52||  Thus, Chandranakha, the mother of Shambuka, was always thinking about her fulfilled desire, while Lakshmana, wandering in the forest, reached that place. ||53||  The fragrance of the Suryahaas sword, a gem, reached Lakshmana, which was worshipped by a thousand gods, naturally had a good fragrance, was infinite, and was adorned with divine garlands and smeared with divine fragrance. ||54-55||  Lakshmana, filled with wonder, abandoned all other activities and, like a lion, fearlessly followed the path of the fragrance. ||56||  He saw a very difficult place, covered with trees, surrounded by a network of creepers, and enclosed by high rocks. ||57||  In the middle of this dense forest, there was a level ground, made of various gems and adorned with golden lotuses. ||58||  In the middle of that level ground, there was a vast bamboo pillar, which, due to unknown curiosity, seemed like the Sudharma heaven. ||59||

Then, at the end, a sword, with a radiant circle of light, was seen, illuminating the bamboo forest. 6

Taking the sword, Lakshmana was filled with wonder. He tested its sharpness by cutting the bamboo stalk. 61

Seeing Lakshmana holding the sword, all the deities there said, "You are our master," and worshipped him with reverence. 62

Then, with tearful eyes, Rama asked, "Sumitra's son, Lakshmana, has been gone for a long time. Where could he have gone?" 63

"O noble Jatayu, rise and fly far into the sky, and search diligently for Lakshmana, the son of Lakshmana." 64

As Jatayu prepared to fly, Sita, with a gesture of her finger, said, "Lakshmana, whose body is smeared with saffron dust, who wears various garlands and robes, and who is adorned with ornaments, is coming." 66

"He is holding this great, radiant sword, and he shines brightly, like a lion on a mountain." 67

Seeing Lakshmana, Rama was filled with wonder and joy. Unable to contain his happiness, he rose and embraced him. 68

When asked, Lakshmana recounted his entire story. Thus, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita, all three, stayed there happily, sharing various stories. 69

Then, Chandanakha, who used to see the sword and her son, who was always disciplined, every day, came there alone. 70

Upon arrival, she saw that the entire bamboo forest had been cut down. She wondered, "Where could my son have gone, living in this forest?" 71

"It was not right for my son to cut down this forest, where he lived and where this sword, a gem, was perfected, for the sake of testing it." 72

At that moment, she saw her son's headless body, lying between a stump, with a radiant head, like the sun setting on the horizon, and adorned with earrings. 73

Although I desire death, even the evil creatures in this terrible forest leave me alone. ||103||
Wandering in this desolate forest for a long time, I have seen you, noble ones, today, due to the destruction of my sinful karma. ||104||
A person who, previously unknown, befriends someone, goes near them uninvited, and speaks excessively without respect, with a vacant mind, what kind of person does not generate hatred? ||105-106||
Even being like this, O beautiful one! As long as I don't leave my body, desire me today, have compassion on me, the sorrowful one. ||107||
Who in this world would not desire a woman who is righteous, virtuous, free from all obstacles, and whose nature is benevolent? ||108||
Hearing her shameless words, Rama and Lakshmana looked at each other and remained silent. ||109||
Their minds, cleansed by the water of knowledge of the meaning of all scriptures, were shining brightly in the discernment of what should be done and what should not be done. ||110||
When she said, "I am leaving," with a sigh filled with sorrow, Rama and the others replied, "Do as you wish." ||111||
As soon as she left, the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, driven by their concern for her, were astonished and laughed. ||112||
Then, overwhelmed with grief, Chandranakha, with a broken heart, flew away in anger, quickly returning to her home. ||113||
Lakshmana was captivated by her beauty, so his eyes were restless. He was filled with longing, wanting to see her again. ||114||
Under the pretext of some other task, he rose from Rama's side and, eager to find Chandranakha, began to wander through the forest on foot. ||115||
His heart was deeply saddened, his eyes were filled with tears, he had ignored the love that Chandranakha had shown him, and he was filled with her love. Lakshmana thought: 1. Bhūtapito (?) M.! 2. Muñcati M. 3. Tasyah ashalīnata akulīnata tayā hṛto. 4. Uthāyāgnapadeśena M. anyavyājena.

## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**231** "My mind, devoid of the right path, has fallen away from the object of duty. It is now being consumed relentlessly by the fire of sorrow." (119) "Where was she born? Whose daughter is she? This beautiful one with excellent eyes, like a deer separated from its herd, how did she come here?" (120) Thinking thus, Lakshmana, who was wandering about and was very distressed because he had not seen her, considered that forest to be like celestial flowers all around. (121)

**_Malini Vritta_** "It is not right for those with pure minds to begin an action without knowing the ultimate truth. Those who are attached to worldly objects, like children, are devoid of wisdom and bear the greatest sorrow when they are deprived of them." (122) "What is this? Why should my mind be attached to this? Why is it desirable? And how do those who follow the path of duty attain happiness and peace?" Thus, the one who is the doer of excellent discrimination, like the sun, shines brightly on the path of the world. (123)

Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the _Shambuka Vada_, narrated by the sage Ravisha. (43)

Chapter Forty-Four

When Chandranakha's beloved, Kharadushana, was destroyed by her own unwillingness, she was again overwhelmed by sorrow, like a river whose dam has broken.  ||1||

Chandranakha, whose body was scorched by the fire of grief, became distraught, like a cow who has lost her calf, and she wailed in various ways. ||2||

Bearing the burden of the aforementioned insult, her mind filled with anger and dejection, Chandranakha, whose eyes were overflowing with tears, was seen by Kharadushana. ||3||

Seeing her, covered in dust, her hair disheveled, her belt loosened, her armpits, thighs, and breasts wounded by nails, stained with blood, her earrings fallen, devoid of ornaments and beauty, her garment torn, her natural radiance extinguished, and resembling a lotus crushed by a maddened elephant, Kharadushana comforted her and asked, "My dear, tell me quickly, by whom have you been brought to this state?" ||4-7||

"Whose eighth moon is today? Who has been seen by death? Who is sleeping on the peak of the mountain, and who is foolishly playing with a serpent? ||8||

"Who has fallen into the well of blindness? Whose destiny is inauspicious? And who, like a moth, desires to fall into my blazing fire of anger?" ||9||

"Shame on that wicked one, like an animal, devoid of reason, who has polluted both worlds with his impure conduct!" ||10||

"Crying is useless. You are no different from other ordinary women. Tell me the name of the one who has touched you, like the flame of a great fire." ||11||

"Like a lion crushing a serpent, I will crush him with my own hand today and send him to Yama's abode." ||12||

Thus spoken, Chandranakha, with great difficulty, stopped crying and spoke in a choked voice. At that time, her cheeks...

## Forty-Fourth Chapter

233

I had gone to see my son who was in the forest. I saw that his head had been severed by someone. ||14||

The base of the trunk, where the blood flowed continuously, appeared like a burning pyre. ||15||

Someone had killed my peaceful son and taken the jewel-studded sword, along with the offerings. ||16||

I, the recipient of thousands of sorrows, devoid of fortune, was lamenting, holding my son's head in my lap. ||17||

Then, that wicked killer of Shambuka, embraced me with his arms, desiring something evil. ||18||

Though I begged him to release me, that low-born man, bound by his lustful touch, did not let me go. ||19||

He tore me apart with his nails and teeth in that desolate forest. What can a helpless woman do against a powerful man? ||20||

Yet, by the grace of some remaining merit, I was protected and, with my character intact, I escaped from that ordeal. ||21||

My brother, Ravana, the lord of all the celestial beings, the cause of the upheaval of the three worlds, is known to be undefeated even by Indra. You, Kharadushana, are a mere mortal, yet I have been reduced to this state by fate. ||22-23||

Hearing this, Kharadushana, filled with grief and anger, rushed to the spot and saw his son dead. ||24||

Though he was once bright like the full moon and had eyes like a deer, he became as terrifying as the midday sun in the summer, upon seeing his son dead. ||25||

He quickly returned and entered his palace, where he held a brief council with his friends. ||26||

Some of his ministers, with harsh intentions and devoted to service, knowing the king's mind, quickly said, "O King, the one who killed Shambuka and took the jewel-studded sword, has been ignored. What will you do about it?" ||27-28||

**Note:** The text mentions "आंसुओंसे भीग रहे थे तथा बिखरे हुए बालोंसे आच्छन्न थे" which translates to "She was drenched in tears and her hair was scattered." This is not part of the numbered verses but a description of the mother's state. 

Page #252:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
The wise minister said, "O Lord, this is not a small matter. Summon all the vassals and inform Ravana." ||29||
"How can one who has obtained the sword-jewel be easily subdued? Therefore, it is not appropriate to be hasty in this matter which requires collective effort." ||30||
At the behest of the Guru's words, a young and swift messenger was sent to Lanka to inform Ravana. ||31||
The messenger, eager to accomplish the task, remained at Ravana's court for a long time due to some royal duty. ||32||
Meanwhile, Khara-Dushana, whose soul was consumed by intense anger and whose mind was constantly dwelling on his son's virtues, spoke again, "The divine army, like a sea, cannot be crossed by those who are devoid of magic, small, and earth-bound creatures." ||33-34||
"Shame on our valor that seeks the help of others. What use is my arm that desires its own other arm?" ||35||
Saying this, Khara-Dushana, filled with pride and his face trembling with anger, swiftly rose from among his friends and flew into the sky. ||36||
Seeing him so determined, his fourteen thousand friends, who were already prepared, marched out of the city in an instant. ||37||
Hearing the sound of the instruments of that Rakshasa army, like the roar of the ocean, Sita was filled with fear. ||38||
"What is this, O Lord? What is this?" Saying this, she clung to her husband like a vine clinging to a Kalpa tree. ||39||
"Do not fear, do not fear," comforting her, Rama thought, "Whose voice could be so powerful?" ||40||
"Is it the roar of a lion, or the sound of a cloud, or the thunder of the sea that fills the entire sky?" ||41||
He said to Sita, "My dear, it seems these are the graceful, winged, powerful Rajahansa birds, who are bowing in our courtyard." ||42||

Page #253:
---------------------------
## Forty-fourth Chapter

235. "Are there any other wicked *dvijas* who are your enemies? Give me the bow, my dear, so that I can destroy them." ||43||

Seeing the large army approaching, filled with various weapons and resembling a cloud driven by the wind, ||44||

Rama said, "Are these gods, the possessors of great strength, going to Nandishvara island to pay homage to the Jinas with devotion?" ||44-45||

"Or, having cut down a bamboo grove and killed a man, has Lakshmana taken this *asir* gem, and are these deceitful enemies approaching?" ||46||

"Or, it seems that this wicked, deceitful woman has stirred up her own people to cause us harm." ||47||

"It is not right to ignore this army that has come so close." Saying this, Rama fixed his gaze on his armor and bow. ||48||

Lakshmana, with folded hands, said, "O Lord, it is not fitting for you to be angry while I am here." ||49||

"You protect the princess, and I will go towards the enemy. If there is any danger to me, you will know it by my lion's roar." ||50||

Saying this, Lakshmana, covered in armor and armed with great weapons, stood ready to fight, facing the enemy. ||51||

Seeing Lakshmana, the valiant, the best of men, with his excellent form, the *vidyadharas* in the sky surrounded him like clouds surrounding a mountain. ||52||

Lakshmana skillfully repelled the *shakti*, *mudgara*, *chakra*, spears, and arrows launched by the *vidyadharas* with his own weapons. ||53||

Then, having stopped all the weapons launched by the *vidyadharas*, he prepared to release his thunderbolt-like arrows at them. ||54||

With a single arrow, Lakshmana, with his controlled mind and knowledge of the battlefield, stopped the great army of *vidyadharas* just as a sage stops evil desires with his special knowledge. ||55||

The heads of the enemies, adorned with jeweled necklaces and earrings, fell from the sky to the earth like lotuses from a celestial lake. ||56||

Mountain-like *dviradas* fell along with their horses, and the sound of their clashing armor was terrifying. ||57||

## Forty-fourth Chapter

Having contemplated and understood the means of abduction through the knowledge of Avalokini, he knew the names, lineage, etc. of those involved. ||72|| This is the well-known Lakshmana, surrounded by many. This is Rama, and this is Sita, renowned for her virtues. ||73|| After creating a calamity for this bowman, he, like Garuda seizing the flesh of a vulture, took Sita. ||74|| Inflamed with anger towards his wife, this invincible Khara-Dushana will kill these two brothers in an instant with his weapons. ||75|| Who does not know the power of a great river with a strong current to sweep away both its banks? ||76|| Thinking thus, the lust-stricken Ravana, with a mind like a child, decided to abduct Sita, just as one decides to drink poison to die. ||77|| When a great battle ensued, filled with the darkness of weapons, he roared like a lion, repeatedly calling out "Rama! Rama!" ||78|| Hearing that lion's roar, Rama understood it was Lakshmana, and he was filled with joy and excitement. ||79|| Then, he covered Sita completely with many garlands and said, "My dear, stay here for a moment, do not be afraid." ||80|| Then, he said to Jatayu, "O noble one, if you remember the favor I have done you, protect my friend's wife with all your might." ||81|| Saying this, even though he was stopped by the crying birds, he left Sita in the forest and swiftly entered the battle. ||82|| Meanwhile, the learned Ravana, the embodiment of knowledge, approached Sita, lifted her with his arms like an elephant lifting a lotus, and attempted to place her in the celestial Pushpaka chariot. ||83|| His mind consumed by the fire of lust, forgetting all Dharma, he began to place her in the Pushpaka chariot, which was in the sky. ||84||

It is good that he strives alone in this way, for the world is the supreme teacher, meaning that the beings of the world are very clever. ||71|| 

Page #256:
---------------------------
238
In the Padma Purana, seeing his beloved woman being carried away, Jatayu, whose soul was ignited by the fire of anger, rose up with great speed. ||45|| With his extremely sharp, claw-like plows, he plowed the field of Dasanana's chest, which was soaked in blood. ||86|| Then, the extremely powerful Jatayu, with his rough, wind-torn, swift wings, tore apart the entire body of Ravana. ||87|| After that, Ravana, enraged by the obstruction of his desired object, killed Jatayu with a blow of his hand and sent him to the ground. ||88|| Then, with his mind greatly disturbed by the harsh blow, the sorrowful bird Jatayu fainted, making a ke-ke sound. ||89|| After that, Ravana, knowing the purpose of his desire, boarded the Pushpaka Vimana with Sita without any hindrance and went as he pleased. ||90|| Knowing that she had been abducted, Sita, overwhelmed by her love for Rama, began to lament, crying out in sorrow. ||91|| Then, seeing Sita weeping, whose heart was attached to her husband, Dasanana became somewhat detached. ||92|| He thought to himself, "What respect does she have for me? She is weeping in sorrow for someone else. Her life is attached to him, and she is distressed by his separation." ||93|| "She is eager to bear the burden of great sorrow, repeatedly mentioning the qualities of other men, who are dear to virtuous people." ||94|| "So, should I kill this fool with this sword? Or, my mind is not inclined to kill a woman." ||95|| "Or, it is not a matter of impatience, because a king who is angry cannot be easily appeased. Similarly, obtaining a desired object, acquiring radiance or fame, a desired knowledge, a heavenly action, a wife who delights the mind, or anything else that is desired, does not happen suddenly. It takes time to obtain them." ||96-97|| I had previously made this vow in the presence of the virtuous:
1. Nakharoopahalaish. 2. Dasananasya idam Dasanana. Dasanana-m., Kh. 3. Nisvanan m. 4. Moodha m. 5. Abhishtallabh. Abhishtalabdh j.

Protecting this vow, therefore, I attain this bliss. My wealth will be favorable to me in time. ||99||

Thus, having gathered her, Ravana kept her near him. For death, driven by karma, awaits its time. ||100||

Then, seeing Rama enter the battlefield, filled with streams of arrows, Lakshmana spoke. ||101||

Alas, my lord! Why have you come to this land, leaving the solitary Maithili in the forest, full of obstacles? ||102||

Hearing your words, I have come here with haste, said Rama. Lakshmana replied, Go quickly, you have not done well. ||103||

Filled with utmost zeal, conquer the powerful enemy by all means. Saying this, Rama, filled with doubt and restless, turned towards Janaki. ||104||

As he returned in a moment, he did not see her there. Seeing this, Rama thought his wealth was lost or fallen. ||105||

Alas, Sita! Saying this, Rama fainted and fell to the ground. The earth, embraced by her husband, became beautiful. ||106||

Regaining consciousness, he looked around the forest, filled with trees. Rama, whose heart was filled with love, spoke in a troubled voice. ||107||

Oh, goddess! Where have you gone? Speak quickly. What is the use of laughing for a long time? I saw you walking among the trees. ||108||

Come, come, I am leaving. What is the purpose of anger, my dear? You know that I am not happy with your anger for a long time. ||109||

Speaking thus, and wandering through that place filled with caves, Rama slowly saw the dying Jatayu, making a faint sound. ||110||

Then, deeply distressed, Rama chanted the Namokar mantra into the ear of the dying bird. By its influence, the bird attained the state of a god. ||111||

Rama, consumed by the fire of separation, fainted again in that lonely forest, overwhelmed by the burning pain of separation. ||112||

I will not enjoy a woman who does not desire me, who is not happy with me. ||28|| 

Page #258:

In the Padma Purana, having been comforted, he looked everywhere, his mind troubled.  He lamented, "Because of despair, I am afflicted by this creature.  "113"  Having reached a cave in the forest, he said, "By whom, by what evil-minded person, has Janaki been taken away?  I am destroyed by the one who has done this difficult deed."  114"  Now, who will be my true friend in this forest, showing me her, having abandoned her, and taking away all my sorrow?"  115"  O trees, have you seen any woman whose radiance is like the champak flower, whose eyes are like lotus petals, whose body is very delicate, who is timid by nature, who is endowed with excellent gait, who brings joy to the heart, whose breath is fragrant like the pollen of the lotus, and who is an unprecedented creation of women?"  116-117"  Why are you all silent?"  Having said this, he was overwhelmed by her qualities and fell to the ground again.  118"  When he regained consciousness, he was enraged and, mounting the great bow called Vajravat, he began to draw it, making a loud twanging sound.  At that time, the best of men, Rama, repeatedly made a very sharp lion roar.  His lion roar was terrifying to the lions, and the elephants, with their ears erect, heard it with fear.  119-120"  Again, overcome by sorrow, he laid down his bow and upper garment, sat down, and immediately grieved over his own folly.  121"  Alas, just as a foolish man defeats dharma-buddhi, so too, without listening carefully and considering, I have, in my haste, lost my beloved.  122"  Just as it is difficult for a man who has once been lost in the forest of the world, a creature who does evil deeds, to find his way back, so too, it is difficult to find my beloved again.

## Translation:

**242**

* **14.**  Either a lion, extremely hungry and completely devoid of reason, has devoured your beloved, who was affectionate towards the virtuous.
* **142.**  Or, a lion, whose very nature is terrifying and whose mane stands on end, might have killed her just by its sight, without even touching her with its claws.
* **143.**  My brother Lakshmana is filled with doubt in this terrible war, and I am also experiencing separation from Sita. I find no joy in this.
* **144.**  I see this entire world as filled with doubt, or perhaps it seems that the entire world has become void. It is right, for the nature of sorrow is very strange.
* **145.**  As long as I do not reach the end of one sorrow, another sorrow arrives. Oh! This ocean of sorrow is vast.
* **146.**  It is often seen that the lame foot gets injured, the tree dried by frost catches fire, and the one who slips falls into a pit. Misfortunes often come in large numbers.
* **147.**  Then, wandering through the forest, seeing the deer and birds, Rama entered his dwelling, the forest. The forest seemed devoid of beauty without Sita.
* **148.**  With a face full of extreme sorrow, and having removed the string from his bow, Rama stood on the ground, clad in white, smooth cloth.
* **149.**  He meditated deeply, again and again, his body becoming motionless for moments. He was filled with despair, and his face was filled with the sound of lamentations.
* **150.**  Oh people! Seeing great men suffering greatly due to the ripening of their past evil karma, always fix your mind on the Dharma preached by the Jinas.

**139-140.**  Just as desire takes away knowledge, so too does a river, with large, sharp waves, flowing very fast and devoid of reason, take away one's beloved.

**Note:** The Jain terms are preserved in the translation.

## Forty-fourth Chapter

**243**

Those who do not worship the words of the Jinas, remaining aloof from the company of the *bhavapramavadika* (those who are attached to worldly affairs), are devoid of refuge and subdued by their senses. The unbearable sun of their past karma constantly burns them. ||151||

Thus ends the forty-fourth chapter of the *Padmacarita*, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, renowned by its *Arsha* name, and describing the abduction of Sita and the lament of Rama. ||44||

## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

In the meantime, Viradhit, the enemy of Kharadushan, who had been mentioned earlier, arrived with his ministers and valiant warriors, fully armed and equipped.  ||1|| He saw Lakshmana, the great warrior, fighting alone, radiating with great energy, and decided that this would lead to the fulfillment of his own desires. ||2||  He knelt on the ground, placing both hands on his head, and with utmost humility, spoke to Lakshmana, saying, "O Lord! I am your devotee. Please listen to my request. The company of great souls like you is the cause of the destruction of sorrow." ||3-4||  Viradhit had only spoken half his words when Lakshmana placed his hand on his head and said, "Stay behind us." ||5||

Then, Viradhit, filled with great wonder and suddenly imbued with great energy, bowed again and spoke these pleasing words, "You, O Lord, should stop this powerful enemy, Kharadushan. I will bring death to the rest of the warriors on the battlefield." ||6-7||  Having said this, he quickly began to destroy Kharadushan's army. He charged towards the enemy forces, accompanied by his own army, with a blazing array of weapons. ||8|| He said, "I am Viradhit, the son of King Chandrodar, and I have come after a long time, eager to be a guest in this battle." ||9||  "Where are you going now? Let those who are valiant in battle stand firm. Today, I will give you the fruit that the terrible Yama, the god of death, gives." ||10||

As he spoke, the warriors on both sides were filled with hatred, and a great clash of weapons, a terrible destruction of men, ensued.  ||11||  Foot soldiers clashed with foot soldiers, horsemen with horsemen, elephant riders with elephant riders, and chariot riders with chariot riders. ||12||

In the Padma Purana,
Khar-Dushan, lifeless, fell to the earth like a fallen celestial being. ||27||
Or, he appeared like the lifeless form of the beloved of Rati, or a fragment of a mountain of jewels, fallen by an elephant. ||28||
Then, Dushan, the commander of Khar-Dushan's army, attempted to disarm Viradhit, the son of King Chandrodar. ||29||
But Lakshmana, with his skill, struck him deeply in his vital spot. The whirling Khar-Dushan fell to the earth and met his end. ||30||
After giving that army to Viradhit, Lakshmana, filled with joy, went to the place where Rama resided. ||31||
Seeing Rama, devoid of Sita, lying on the ground, Lakshmana exclaimed, "O Lord, arise and tell me, where has Janaki gone?" ||32||
Rama, rising quickly, saw Lakshmana, his body free from wounds, and, filled with a little joy, rushed to embrace him. ||33||
He said to Lakshmana, "O noble one, I do not know if the Goddess has been abducted by someone, or devoured by a lion. I have searched this forest extensively, but she is nowhere to be found." ||34||
"Perhaps she has been taken to the netherworld, or carried to the peak of the sky, or, being delicate, she has vanished out of fear." ||35||
Then, Lakshmana, his body consumed by anger, spoke in a tone of despair, "O Lord, there is no point in prolonging this anxiety." ||36||
"It seems that Janaki has been abducted by some demon. Whoever is holding her, I will surely retrieve her. There is no doubt about it." ||37||
Consoling him with various words, sweet to the ears, the wise Lakshmana washed Rama's face with pure water. ||38||
Hearing that loud sound, Rama, his face filled with a little confusion, asked Lakshmana, "Is the earth making this sound, or is it coming from the sky? Have you left any of my enemies remaining, causing this fear?" ||39-40||

## The Forty-Fifth Chapter

Sumitra's son then said to the Lord, "O Lord, in this great battle, the Khechara has done me a great favor. This son of Chandrodara, Viradhit, is known to be a great warrior. He has been sent to me by fate, for my benefit. This noble-hearted Khechara is coming with a great army of four types. The sound of his arrival has reached my ears. While this story is being told between the two of us, Viradhit, with his great army, has arrived."

The Khechara king, Viradhit, with his ministers, folded his hands and said, "Victory, victory! O Lord, you, the best of men, have arrived after a long time. Please give me your orders regarding what needs to be done."

Lakshmana replied, "O noble one, listen! A wicked person has taken away my elder brother Rama's wife. Rama, bereft of her, is consumed by grief. If he gives up his life, I will surely enter the fire. O noble one, know for sure that my life is bound to his. Therefore, we must find a way out of this situation."

Viradhit, the king of the Khecharas, lowered his head and thought, "Alas! Even after all this effort, my hope has not been fulfilled. I used to live happily, fulfilling my desires. Then, I was displaced and wandered through various forests. Now, I have entrusted myself to these people, and see, they themselves are falling into the pit of doubt and sorrow. I have reached the shore of the ocean of sorrow. Whatever vine I grasp, fate uproots it. Indeed, the whole world is subject to karma. Even if they do good or bad to me according to their karma, I will still be enthusiastic and carry out this task for them."

Thinking thus, Viradhit, the brave and enthusiastic, spoke to his ministers with bright words, "If the wife of this great man has been taken to the earth, the sky, the mountains, the water, the land, or the forest, search for her diligently in all directions. If you find her, you will be rewarded, my great warriors."

## Chapter 248

**Verse 57:** Thus spoken, the Vidyadevas, filled with joy, armed, and possessing great energy, adorned with various ornaments, and desirous of fame, flew in all ten directions.

**Verse 58:** Then, the Vidyadeva named Ratnajaati, son of Arkajaati, who wielded a sword, heard a sound of weeping from afar.

**Verse 59:** Following the sound of weeping, he reached the direction from where it came and heard in the sky above the ocean, "Oh Rama! Oh Kumar Lakshmana!"

**Verse 60:** Hearing this very clear sound of lament, he flew towards that place and saw a Vimana.

**Verse 61-62:** Seeing Sita, extremely distraught, lamenting atop the Vimana, he, filled with anger, said, "Stop! Stop, you wicked, vile, low Vidyadeva! Having committed such a crime, where do you think you are going now?

**Verse 63:** Oh foolish one! If you desire life, then quickly release the wife of Ramadeva and the sister of the Bhamandala."

**Verse 64:** Then, Ravana, filled with anger and with a disturbed mind, addressed Ratnajaati with harsh words, ready to fight.

**Verse 65-66:** Then, he thought, "If a battle ensues, I will not be able to see this distraught Sita, and in that state, she might meet her end. And even if I protect this frightened Sita, with my extremely troubled mind, I will not be able to kill this Vidyadeva, even though he is insignificant."

**Verse 67:** Thus, thinking, with his crown and upper garment loosened due to agitation, the powerful Ravana took away the Vidya of the aerial Ratnajaati.

**Verse 68:** Then, the frightened Ratnajaati, due to the effect of some mantra, fell slowly to the earth like a meteor.

**Verse 69:** Like a merchant whose ship has sunk, he, with the remaining essence of his life, reached the island called Kambu, situated in the middle of the ocean.

**Verse 70:** There, he sat still for a moment, then, with great effort, climbed the Kambu mountain and looked in all directions.

**Verse 54-56:** "Search diligently in all directions, in mountains, water, land, forests, or cities, wherever she might have been taken. Oh great warriors! Whatever you desire, I will grant it to you upon finding her."

Then, with the cool sea breeze, his fatigue and sweat subsided. He sighed deeply, filled with sorrow. ||7||

Those others who had gone to search for Sita, having searched with all their might, returned to Rama, their faces devoid of joy. ||72||

Seeing their dejected faces and their eyes fixed on the ground, their hearts empty, Padma, with a long, hot breath, spoke, his eyes weary. ||73||

"You, blessed celestial beings, have not abandoned your strength, but have strived in our cause. Yet, fate is against me." ||74||

"Now, stay as you wish, or go to your homes. What is lost in the great fire, can it be seen again?" ||75||

"Surely, whatever karma I have done, I am destined to receive its fruit. Neither you nor I can change it." ||76||

"I have taken refuge in this harsh, distant forest, bereft of kin. Even here, the enemy of fate has not shown me mercy." ||77||

"It seems this relentless misfortune is clinging to me. What greater sorrow can it bring?" ||78||

As Rama began to lament, Viradhit, skilled in comforting, spoke with great composure, "Oh, Lord, why do you indulge in such unparalleled sorrow? You will see your beloved, the embodiment of purity, in a few days." ||79-80||

"Indeed, this sorrow is a potent poison, destroying the body it clings to. What need is there to speak of other things?" ||81||

"Therefore, embrace the fortitude cherished by great men. You, noble souls, are the fertile ground for the birth of wisdom." ||82||

"A courageous man, even if he lives, sees prosperity after a long time. But a man of weak intellect, even in hardship, cannot see it." ||83||

"This is not the time for sorrow. Focus your mind on action, for apathy brings great harm." ||84||

In the Padma Purana, the great Vidhyadhara king, Kharadushana, has been killed. This is a change in circumstances, and its consequences will be dire. You should understand this. ||45||
The king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, Indrajit, Bhanukarna, Trishhira, Kshobhana, Bhima, Krurakarma, and Mahodara, all great warriors, masters of various arts and possessing immense power, will be filled with anger at the grief of their friend Kharadushana's family. ||86-87||
All these warriors have earned great fame in thousands of battles, and even the king of the Vidhyadharas, who resides on the mountain of Vijayanga, could not subdue them. ||88||
The son of the wind god, Hanuman, is very famous. When the enemy sees his banner marked with a monkey, they flee in terror. ||89||
Even the gods, by the will of fate, abandon their desire for victory when they face him. He is truly a great and glorious man. ||90||
Therefore, rise up and seek refuge in the protected place called Alankarpur. There, you can stay peacefully and receive news of the welfare of the earth. ||91||
Alankarpur is located beneath the earth and has been passed down through our lineage. We will stay in that impregnable place and consider our course of action as appropriate. ||92||
Having said this, Rama and Lakshmana mounted a magnificent, shining chariot drawn by four swift horses and set out. ||93||
Just as knowledge and character without right vision are not adorned, so too, Rama and Lakshmana, without Sita, were not adorned at that time. ||94||
Surrounded by a sea of four types of great armies, Viradha stood before them, eager for battle. ||95||
By the time he arrived, the son of Chandranakha had emerged from the city gate and engaged in battle. Viradha defeated him and entered the beautiful city. ||96||
That city was like the abode of the gods, shining with jewels. Viradha and Rama-Lakshmana settled there, in the palace of Kharadushana, as befitted their status. ||97||
Although that palace was like the abode of the gods, Rama could not find peace there without Sita. He felt no joy without her. ||98||
Even the forest becomes beautiful when a beloved is present. For one consumed by the fire of separation from his beloved, even the entire Vindhya forest becomes desolate. ||99||
1. All have earned great fame. ||
2. They flee. ||
3. The group. ||
4. They abandon the desire. ||
5. Right vision, knowledge. ||
6. In turmoil. ||

## Forty-Fifth Chapter: The Agony of Separation

**251**

And then, in the secluded part of that house, adorned with trees, seeing the incomparable temple, Rama went there.  ||10||

Seeing the Arhat, worshipped with jewels and flowers, his sorrow momentarily forgotten, he attained supreme tranquility. ||10||

Looking around at the other images, he stood there, his sorrow somewhat calmed. ||102||

Sunda, protected by his army, and accompanied by his mother Chandanakha, went to Lanka, grieving for the loss of his father and brother. ||103||

Gautama Swami says: "O noble ones, knowing that these possessions are perishable, obtained through various painful means and fraught with many obstacles, do not desire them. ||104||

Even though there is hope of accumulating possessions due to the influence of past karma, upon attaining knowledge through the teachings of the wise, that hope is destroyed just as night is destroyed by the rising sun." ||105||

Thus ends the forty-fifth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, describing the agony of Sita's separation. ||45||

**Note:**

* **Arhat:** A Jain term for a liberated soul, a perfect being.
* **Jineendra:** Another Jain term for an Arhat.
* **Samgama:** A Jain term for the state of being united with the divine.
* **Bhavya:** A Jain term for a soul that is destined for liberation.
* **Parigraha:** A Jain term for attachment to worldly possessions.

## The Forty-Sixth Chapter

There, seated on the lofty peak of his aerial chariot, Ravana, moving freely, shone like the sun in the sky.  ||1||

Seeing Sita's face, wilted with sorrow, Ravana, whose mind was intoxicated with lust and desire, pondered. ||2||

Standing before Sita, whose face was constantly bathed in tears, Ravana, with great humility, spoke hundreds of sweet words. ||3||

He said, "If I die, struck by the extremely soft, flower-tipped arrows of Kamadeva, then, O virtuous one, you will be guilty of manslaughter." ||4||

"O beautiful one, even when your lotus-like face is filled with anger, it still shines. For beauty is inherent in all that is beautiful." ||5||

"O Goddess, be pleased and cast your eyes upon this servant. My fatigue will be washed away by the water of your radiant eyes." ||6||

"O fair-faced one, if you do not grant me the favor of your gaze, then strike my head with this lotus-like foot of yours." ||7||

"Why have I not become an Ashoka tree in your beautiful garden? For there, the praiseworthy touch of your lotus-like feet would be readily available." ||8||

"O slender-waisted one, look out from the window of the chariot's peak and see the directions. I am flying in the sky, even higher than the sun." ||9||

"O Goddess, look at this earth, adorned with mountain ranges, Mount Meru, and the ocean. It seems as if it were created by a skilled craftsman." ||10||

Thus spoken to, Sita, sitting with her back turned, placed a blade of grass between them and spoke these harsh words. ||11||

She said, "O low-born man, get away! Do not touch my body. How dare you speak such vile words?" ||12|| 

Page #271:
---------------------------
## The Forty-Sixth Chapter

This wicked act of yours is sinful, reduces your lifespan, leads to hell, brings disrepute, is against dharma, and causes fear. ||13||

By desiring another man's wife, you will experience great sorrow, and your entire body will be consumed by remorse, like a body covered in ashes. ||14||

Your mind is filled with the mud of sin, so teaching you dharma is futile, like dancing in front of a blind man. ||15||

Oh, lowly one! By merely desiring another's wife, you will bind yourself to a great sin and go to hell, where you will suffer. ||16||

Even though Sita used harsh words to rebuke Ravana, his love for her did not diminish because his mind was consumed by lust. ||17||

After the battle with Khara and Dushana ended, the ministers, Shuk, Hast, Prahast, and others, were filled with anxiety because they had not seen their master, Ravana. When they saw his chariot approaching, adorned with a fluttering flag and shining like the morning sun, they were overjoyed and went to meet him. ||18-19||

They offered him divine gifts, showered him with praise, and welcomed him with great pomp, but Sita remained unmoved by their wealth and offerings. ||20||

Who in this world is wise enough to drink fire, or touch a gem-studded rod placed on the head of a serpent? ||21||

Even though Sita had scorned Ravana, comparing him to a blade of grass, he placed his hands together in a gesture of respect, with ten fingers joined, and bowed to her repeatedly. ||22||

Ravana, surrounded by ministers who were as powerful as Indra, and who had come from all directions, was praised with words like "Victory to you, grow prosperous, be blessed," which were pleasing to the ears. He entered Lanka, a city as vast as the earth. ||23-24||

At that time, Sita thought, "This king of the Vidyadharas is acting without any restraint. Where can one find refuge when such a person is around?" ||25||

"I will not eat until I receive news of my husband's well-being. This is my vow." ||26||

Page #272:
---------------------------
## Padma Purana

**1**

There is a very bright garden called Devaranya in the west, which is like heaven. It is full of large trees like Kalpavriksha. After settling Sita in that garden, Ravana went to his palace.

**27-28**

As soon as Ravana heard the news of Khara-Dushana's death, his eighteen thousand wives started wailing loudly in front of him, overwhelmed with grief.

**29**

Chandranakha, falling at her brother's feet and tearing her throat, cried out, "Alas! I am unfortunate, I am killed!" She lamented, drowning the evil day in a torrent of tears.

**30**

Seeing Chandranakha lamenting so much, her heart burning with the fire of her husband and son's death, her brother Ravana said to her:

**31**

"My dear sister, your crying is in vain. Is it not known that all beings in the world receive the fruits of their past actions? There is no doubt about it."

**32**

"If it were not so, then where are the earth-bound humans with their limited powers, and where is your husband, who is capable of flying in the sky?"

**33**

"Knowing that this is the result of my past actions, it is not appropriate for any mortal to grieve."

**34**

"No one dies before their time, even if struck by a thunderbolt. When the time of death arrives, even nectar becomes poison for a living being."

**35**

"My dear sister, the one who killed Khara-Dushana in battle is death for all our enemies. I will kill them all."

**36**

Thus, comforting his sister and giving her instructions to worship the Jina, Ravana, with a burning heart, went to his residence.

**37**

There, without waiting for any respect, he lay down on his bed. At that time, he looked like a mad lion or a snake breathing heavily.

**38**

Seeing her husband like this, Mandodari, devoid of the adornments of a grieving woman, approached him with great respect and said:

**39**

"My lord, why are you so distressed by the death of Khara-Dushana? Brave warriors do not grieve even in the face of great adversity."

**40**

**1. Tarutalchchhaye Mahapadapam. 2. Sarvam. 3. Mandodari.** 

Page #273:
---------------------------
## Chapter Forty-Six

**41.** In many battles before, your friends have perished. You did not grieve for them, but why are you grieving for Kharadushan now?

**42.** In the battle with Indra, many kings like Srimal, who were your relatives, perished. You never grieved for them.

**43.** Even in the face of great calamities, you never grieved for anyone. Why are you grieving now? I wish to know, O Lord, tell me the reason.

**44.** Then, with great respect, Ravana sighed and said, leaving his bed slightly, his words half-spoken and half-unspoken.

**45.** Listen, Sundari, I tell you one thing with sincerity. You are the mistress of my life, and I have always desired you.

**46.** If you wish me to live, then, Devi, you should not be angry. For life is the root of all things.

**47.** Then, after Mandodari said, "It is so," Ravana, bound by oaths, spoke to her, somewhat ashamed.

**48.** If Sita, who is the creation of the Creator, does not desire me as her husband, then I have no life.

**49.** Beauty, youth, form, sweetness, and graceful movements, all have been attained by obtaining that one beautiful woman.

**50.** Then, knowing this difficult situation of Ravana, Mandodari, smiling and with her teeth shining like the moon, spoke thus:

**51.** O Lord, it is a great wonder that you are begging for a boon. It seems that she is a sinful woman who does not herself request you.

**52.** Or, perhaps, she is the only one in the entire world who deserves the highest happiness, for whom a man like you, full of pride, begs with humility.

**53.** Why don't you forcefully embrace her with these arms, adorned with jeweled bracelets and resembling the trunk of an elephant?

**54.** Ravana said, "Devi, listen to the reason why I am forcefully taking her, who is beautiful in every way." 

Page #274:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
It was at the feet of Anantavirya, the Maghava, that I took this vow, in the assembly of the Nirgrantha sages. ||55|| This was explained by Anantavirya, who is worshipped by the Indras, that even a single renunciation brings the highest fruit. ||56|| For those who wander through the cycle of births and deaths, filled with suffering, even a small renunciation of sin is the cause of liberation from the world. ||57|| Those who do not have even a single rule of renunciation, are like broken pots, devoid of any virtue. ||58|| There is no difference between humans and animals, for those who do not have even a single rule of renunciation, are the cause of liberation. ||59|| With your strength, renounce your sins and acquire the wealth of virtue, so that you do not wander in the world like the blind born, for a long time. ||60|| Thus, having drunk the nectar of the words that came from the lotus mouth of the Bhagavan, some men attained the state of Nirgrantha, and some, with weak powers, took refuge in the Dharma of the householder. ||61-62|| At that time, a sage with a gentle mind said to me, "O Dasanana, take on a single rule, according to your strength." ||63|| You have attained the island of the shining jewel of Dharma, so why do you go with an empty mind and empty hands, being wise and skilled in the collection of virtues? ||64|| Thus, having said this, O Devi, I bowed to the sage and said in the presence of the gods, demons, and sages, "As long as a woman does not desire me, even if I am in distress, I will not force myself upon her." ||65-66|| O beloved, I took this vow out of pride, for who, seeing me, would consider me worthy of respect? ||67|| Therefore, O Devi, I do not take her, who is beautiful, for myself, for kings speak only once, otherwise there is great harm. ||68|| Therefore, until I give up my life, please appease Sita, for my efforts in this house will be in vain. ||69||

Page #275:

## The Forty-Sixth Chapter
## 257

Then, knowing her to be in such a state, Mandodari, filled with compassion, said to her lord, "This is a small matter, my lord." ||70||

Then, somewhat swayed by the allure of sweet pleasures, she, the lotus-eyed Mandodari, went to the Devaranya garden. ||71||

Upon receiving her command, eighteen thousand of Ravana's wives, adorned with splendor, followed her. ||72||

Mandodari, whose mind was adorned with the knowledge of all political strategies, approached Sita and spoke to her in this manner: ||73||

"Oh, beautiful one, why are you grieving instead of rejoicing? The woman whose husband is Ravana is blessed in all three worlds." ||74||

"Why do you not desire Ravana as your husband, he who is the lord of all the Vidyadharas, who has defeated Indra, and who is the most beautiful in all three worlds?" ||75||

"Is your husband some poor, landless man, that you are so distressed for him? You should make yourself happy, being the best of all beings." ||76||

"There is no fault in a person who acts for their own benefit, for all actions are meant for happiness." ||77||

"If you do not accept my words, then may the consequences befall your enemies." ||78||

"Ravana is very powerful and free from enemies. He will be filled with anger and desire if his request is denied." ||79||

"Even if those two men named Rama and Lakshmana are dear to you, there is doubt about them too, if Ravana is angered." ||80||

"Therefore, quickly accept the lord of the Vidyadharas, Ravana. Obtain supreme wealth and enjoy the divine play of the gods." ||81||

Thus spoken to, Sita, whose voice was choked with tears and whose eyes were filled with water, said: ||82||

"Oh, lady, all these words of yours are completely against the dharma. How can such words come from the mouth of a virtuous woman?" ||83||

"This body of mine, you may cut, you may break, you may kill. But I will not even think of another man as my husband." ||84||

"For, after the house is reduced to ashes, digging a well is a useless effort." ||86|| 

Page #276:

Even when threatened by tigers with fearsome fangs and unbearable roars, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||19|| Even when threatened by lions with shaking manes and sharp claws, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||10|| Even when threatened by large serpents with blazing sparks and flickering tongues, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||101|| Even when threatened by cruel monkeys with gaping mouths, who were constantly leaping and falling, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||102|| Even when threatened by tall, black, roaring Vetalas, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||103|| Even when threatened by various kinds of terrifying afflictions, moment by moment, Sita did not seek refuge in Ravana. ||104||
After that, as if the night had passed in fear, the sound of conch shells and drums echoed in the Jina temples. ||105|| As dawn broke, the doors of the great palaces opened, and it seemed as if they had opened their sleepless eyes. ||106|| The eastern sky, painted by the evening, was resplendent, as if it had been smeared with saffron for the arrival of the sun. ||107|| The sun rose, dispelling the darkness of night and dimming the moon, and caused the lotuses to bloom. ||108|| Then, as the morning air became clear and the birds began to fly, Vibhishana and his other dear friends arrived at Ravana's side. ||109|| Their faces were downcast with grief for Khara and Dushana, and their eyes were filled with tears, as they sat down on the ground in a proper manner. ||110|| At that time, Vibhishana heard the heart-rending sound of a woman weeping, burdened with grief, from within the curtain. ||111|| Hearing this, Vibhishana became agitated and said, "Who is this unknown woman who is making such a sorrowful sound, as if she has been separated from her lord?" ||112||
Not gone. ||98||
1. In which the birds were flying, in that.

Padma Purana
This word indicates the intense trembling of her body, born from grief, which carries the burden of sorrow. ||113|| Hearing these words, Sita cried even louder. Indeed, grief increases in the presence of the virtuous. ||114|| With tear-filled eyes, she uttered these words, her voice choked with emotion: "Oh, my dear brother, who are you, that you ask me with such affection?" ||115|| "I am Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, the sister of the Bhāmaṇḍala, the wife of Kakutstha, and the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha." ||116|| "While my husband went to inquire about your well-being, this wicked-hearted one abducted me, taking advantage of a weakness. ||117|| "Oh, brother, please take me to Rama quickly, before he gives up his life, separated from me." ||118|| Hearing these words, Vibhīshaṇa's heart burned with anger. Then, with humility and love for his elder brother, he said: "Brother, how could you, blinded by delusion, bring this woman, who is like a venomous serpent, a source of fear and danger?" ||119-120|| "Oh, master, though I am of childish intellect, please listen to my plea. You have granted me the favor of speaking my mind." ||121|| "Oh, master of Dharma, the entire world is enveloped in the network of your glorious deeds, like vines. Do not let the fire of disgrace consume it. Be pleased." ||122|| "This desire for another man's wife is wrong, extremely terrible, shameful, repulsive, and destructive of both worlds." ||123|| "The condemnation that is received from all the virtuous is capable of breaking the hearts of the compassionate. ||124|| "You, who know all the rules of Dharma, the lord of the Vidyadharas, why are you holding this burning ember in your heart?" ||125|| "Whoever indulges in the sin of another man's wife, enters hell just as a piece of iron sinks into water." ||126||

## The Forty-Sixth Canto

**261** Touching that, Ravana said, "What is that on the earth that I am not the master of? Therefore, how can this be a foreign object for me?" **127**

Saying this, the one with a different mind began to speak in vain. Then, seizing the opportunity, the great strategist Maricha said, **128**

"Knowing the whole story of the world, O Dashaanan, why did you do such a deed? This is truly the act of delusion." **129**

"A wise man, having risen in the morning, should consider his own good and bad with discrimination." **130**

Speaking thus, the great-minded Maricha, being impartial, stood up, causing a commotion in the assembly. **131**

Then, surrounded by great riches and mounted warriors, Ravana mounted the elephant named Trilokamanadana. **132**

Placing Sita, who was filled with grief, on the Pushpaka chariot, and placing her in front, he proceeded towards the city with great splendor. **133**

Men with spears, swords, umbrellas, and flags in their hands, making a loud noise with their shouts and confusion, were walking in front. **134**

Thousands of horses with swaying necks, strong backs, and beautiful riders, digging the earth with their restless hooves, were moving. **135**

Elephants, whose bells were making a loud sound, roaring like clouds, driven by their keepers, and resembling mountains with their huge cheeks, were moving. **136**

Men, laughing loudly, performing various acts, and seeming to shatter the sky, were going ahead of him. **137**

Filling the directions with the sound of thousands of musical instruments, Dashaanan entered the city of Lanka, adorned with gems and golden arches. **138**

Although Ravana was surrounded by such beautiful wealth, Sita considered him even lower than grass. **139**

By nature, the pure-minded Vaidehi could not be tempted by Ravana, just as a lotus cannot be stained by water. **140**

Padmapurana
The forest called Pramada, where Sita was taken, was full of flowers, various trees and creepers, and as beautiful as Nandana forest. ||141|| Situated on top of a mountain of flowers, it captivates the eyes, and even the gods feel immense excitement upon seeing it. ||142|| The mountain was adorned with seven gardens, each unique and beautiful, and it shone brightly like Mount Meru, surrounded by forests like Bhadrashala. ||143|| Gautama Swami says, "O King! Listen to the names of the various wondrous forests, which are parts of that mountain." ||144|| The names of the seven forests on that mountain are: 1. Prakirnaka, 2. Janananda, 3. Sukhasevya, 4. Samuccaya, 5. Charanapriya, 6. Nibodha, and 7. Pramada. ||145|| Among these, the Prakirnaka forest is the earth, but beyond it is the Janananda forest, where only those who are allowed to come and go freely play. ||146|| Above it is the third forest, called Sukhasevya, which is filled with soft trees, resembles a cloud mass, and is beautiful with rivers and ponds. In that forest are trees ten spans tall, blocking the path of the sun, adorned with Ketaki and Juhi flowers, and entwined with betel vines. ||147-148|| Above it is the fourth forest, called Samuccaya, with unobstructed movement, where beautiful women are adorned with graceful gestures, and noble men are also adorned. ||149|| Above it is the fifth forest, called Charanapriya, a beautiful, sin-destroying forest, where the Charana-Riddhi-dharis, the Muni-Rajas, are engaged in their studies. ||150|| [Above it is the sixth forest, called Nibodha, which is the abode of knowledge] and beyond it, climbing up, is the seventh forest, called Pramada, which appears like the back of a horse, with excellent, comfortable steps for climbing. ||151|| In this Pramada forest are beautiful ponds suitable for bathing and playing, adorned with lotuses, water-houses in various places, and assembly halls built with many sections. ||152|| There are trees like Naring and Bijapur, laden with fruits, surrounded by date palms, coconut palms, and other trees. ||153|| In that Pramada forest, all the elephants are covered with flower garlands, and they sing in a drunken state.

## Chapter Forty-Six

**Verse 155:** The vines, with their delicate leaves like hands, dance in the gentle breeze, adorned with beautiful flowers and fruits.

**Verse 156:** Beloved by the deer, these trees, with their long, cloud-like branches, provide shade in all seasons and are constantly served by them.

**Verse 157:** The ponds, with their lotus-like faces, gaze upon the beauty of the forest, their dark, lotus-like eyes seemingly never satisfied.

**Verse 158:** The ponds, dancing in the gentle breeze, seem to laugh with the flocks of swans, their laughter echoing the deep calls of the cuckoos in the dense forests.

**Verse 159:** What more need be said? This garden, called "Pramada," filled with all pleasures and festivities, surpasses even the Nandana forest in beauty.

**Verse 160:** In this Pramada garden, there is a pond called "Ashoka Malini," adorned with lotus leaves, golden steps, and intricately designed towers.

**Verse 161:** This garden is further embellished with beautiful houses, adorned with windows and balconies, embraced by lush vines, and waterfalls cascading with sparkling water.

**Verse 162:** In this garden, under the shade of an Ashoka tree, sits Shokavati Sita, looking like Lakshmi herself, fallen from heaven.

**Verse 163:** At Ravana's command, women adorned with clothes, perfumes, and ornaments, constantly try to please Sita.

**Verse 164:** But even with divine music, sweet words like nectar, and wealth beyond compare, Sita cannot be swayed.

**Verse 165:** Despite this, Ravana, consumed by the flames of his passionate love, sends one messenger after another.

**Verse 166:** He says, "Go, messenger, and tell Sita that it is no longer appropriate to ignore Ravana, who is filled with love. Let her be pleased."

**Verse 167:** The messenger goes to Sita and returns to Ravana, saying, "O Lord, she has abandoned her food and sits alone. How can she accept you?" 

Page #282:

In the Padma Purana, she sits silently, not speaking, not moving her body, and does not even look at us, being consumed by great sorrow. ||168|| She does not accept even the most delicious food, like milk and other things, which are fragrant and of many colors. ||169|| Then, Ravana, who was burning with the flames of the fire of Kamadeva, and who was immersed in the ocean of sorrow, thought deeply. ||170|| He would sometimes grieve, letting out long, hot breaths, and sometimes, with his mouth dry, he would sing some unintelligible words. ||171|| He would repeatedly shake his lotus-like face, which was scorched by the frost of Kamadeva, and sometimes, he would sit still for a moment, thinking about something and laughing. ||172|| He would roll on the floor, which was studded with jewels, and repeatedly stretch out all his limbs, which were consumed by the great fire of attachment. ||173|| Then, he would stand up, empty of heart, and sit on his seat. Sometimes, he would go out, and seeing someone, he would return. ||174|| Like an elephant with its trunk, which can go in all directions, he would, without fear, strike the floor with his hand, making it tremble. ||175|| Remembering Sita, who had come into his mind, he would blame his own strength and his destiny, which had been unkind to him, and tears would flow from his eyes. ||176|| He would call out to someone, and when the people nearby would shout back, he would remain silent. Then, he would repeatedly speak without any purpose, saying, "What is it? What is it?" ||177|| Sometimes, he would raise his face and shout, "Sita, Sita," repeatedly, and sometimes, he would lower his face and scratch the earth with his nails, sitting silently. ||178|| Sometimes, he would clean his chest with his hand, sometimes he would look at the tips of his arms, sometimes he would let out a roar, and sometimes he would lie down on his bed. ||179|| Sometimes, he would place a lotus on his heart, and sometimes, he would throw it away. He would repeatedly recite love poems and look at the sky. ||180|| How can this be accepted? ||167||

In the Padma Purana, there is no one else who is as beneficial to Ravana as Vibhishana. He is always vigilant, utilizing all his capabilities for Ravana's benefit. ||195|| The old ministers said to Vibhishana, "Oh, wise one! Now that the king is behaving in this way, what should we do?" ||196|| Having heard Vibhishana's words, Sambhinnamathi said, "What more can we say? All our efforts have become futile, everything is in disarray." ||197|| By the will of fate, Ravana's right arm, Khadusha, was suddenly destroyed. ||198|| The Vidhyadhara named Viradhit, who was insignificant to anyone, has now abandoned his jackal nature and attained the strength of a lion. ||199|| Look at the grandeur he has attained due to the rise of his virtuous deeds. He has become a friend to Lakshmana, who is known for his noble actions. ||200|| On the other hand, all these monkey-descendants are proud and strong. They can only be subdued by force, never by peaceful means. ||201|| Their appearance is one thing, but their minds are quite different. Just like snakes, they appear gentle on the outside, but inside they harbor deadly poison. ||202|| Hanuman, the husband of Anangakusuma, the daughter of Khadusha, is now the leader of the monkey clan. He is particularly loyal to Sugriva. ||203|| After Sambhinnamathi finished speaking, the five-faced minister laughed scornfully and said, "What good is it to dwell on Khadusha's story, to think about his death?" ||204|| What fear or disgrace can arise from this story? None, because this is the way of brave warriors in battle. ||205|| If the wind carries away a single particle from the ocean, does it diminish the ocean? Not at all. Ravana is very powerful, what does it matter if he has some flaws? ||206|| My heart is filled with shame when I think about this. On one hand, we have Ravana, the lord of the world, and on the other, these forest dwellers. ||207|| Even though Lakshmana wields the Suryahaas sword, what can he do? Who is there who would follow the wishes of someone who has been defeated? ||208|| 

Page #285:

## Forty-sixth Chapter

267. Even though a mountain is guarded by a lion, what can it do against a forest fire? 209.  After shaking his head, Sahasramati, the minister, spoke, indicating that the previous words were tasteless. He said, "What is the use of these meaningless words filled with pride? Those who wish well for their master should engage in counsel that is relevant to the situation." 210-211.  One should not underestimate an enemy thinking, "He is small," because even a single spark of fire can burn the entire world in time. 212.  Ashvagriva, the king of a vast army, was renowned throughout the world, yet he was slain on the battlefield by a small three-pronged weapon. 213.  Therefore, without delay, this city of Lanka should be made extremely impregnable by wise men. 214.  These terrifying machines should be deployed in all directions. From the peaks of the towering ramparts, one should keep watch over what has been done and what remains to be done. 215.  The entire populace should be constantly served with many honors, and the ministers, speaking sweet words, should consider all people as their own family. 216.  Those who are dear to the king should protect him by all means, so that King Dashaanan can attain happiness. 217.  Just as a serpent is pleased by milk, so too should Sita be pleased by excellent diplomacy, the most beloved sweet words, and gifts. 218.  Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, and other valiant warriors should be stationed outside the city, ready to defend it. 219.  By doing this, those stationed outside, like Sugriva, will not be able to know the secrets within, and because they are entrusted with tasks, they will believe that the king is pleased with them. 220.  When every task here becomes extremely difficult in every way, who will know whether the abducted Sita is here or elsewhere? 221.  Without Sita, Rama will surely abandon his life. For how can one live when one's beloved wife is in separation? 222.  When Rama attains the five elements, overwhelmed by grief, what will his friend, Saumitri, do, alone and with only a small force? 223. 

Page #286:

268
In the Padma Purana, or by the grief of Rama, his death is certain. The union of the lamp and light is most auspicious. ||22|| Being submerged in the ocean of sin, where will the poet go? Or if he goes, it is said that he will go to Sugriva. ||225|| Who in the world will destroy the illusion that creates doubt in Sugriva, other than the lord of ten faces? ||226|| Therefore, to accomplish that difficult task, Sugriva will serve the lord, Dashaanan. And the union of Dashaanan with Sugriva will be auspicious in the end. ||227|| In this way, Dashaanan will conquer these enemies and others as well. Therefore, let effort be made in this matter. ||228|| Thus, considering, the wise ministers, with joyful minds, went to their respective homes, having decided on the work to be done. ||229|| Vibhishana made the city very difficult to enter by means of machines, etc., and by means of various kinds of knowledge, he made Lanka full of deep pits and snares. ||230||
Gautama Swami says, "O King! No work of men who have pure minds is independent of the words of the wise, that is, their every work is done according to what the wise say. The work that the wise Lord has told for men does not succeed without effort, and effort does not become the cause of desired success without destiny. Therefore, O Bhavyajivas! He is the cause of all, strive to please him. ||231|| O King! As long as the rise of men's karma is present, various kinds of auspicious words do not enter their minds. Therefore, one should do auspicious and virtuous deeds according to one's own proper position, so that the scorching sun of grief does not arise again. ||232||
Thus ends the forty-sixth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, describing the various forms of Ravana's illusion. ||46||

## Forty-Seventh Chapter

Kiskinḏhēśa, grieving for his beloved, wandered about. He reached the place where the battle had taken place. [1]

There he saw broken chariots, dead elephants, and fallen chieftains with their horses, their bodies mangled and torn. [2]

He saw some kings burning, some gasping for breath, some loyal warriors dying for their lord. [3]

Some had lost their arms, some their thighs, some had their intestines spilling out, some had their heads crushed. [4]

Some were surrounded by jackals, some were being devoured by birds, and some were covered by their weeping families. [5]

When he asked what had happened, someone told him that Sītā had been abducted and that Jatayu and Khara-Dūṣaṇa had been killed. [6]

Kiskinḏhēśa was deeply saddened by the death of Khara-Dūṣaṇa. He was overwhelmed with worry and thought, "Alas, I had thought that I would be able to relieve my sorrow by appealing to that powerful one. With great hope, I came here. But my fate, like an elephant, has destroyed my hope, like a great tree. Alas, how can I, a sinner, find peace?" [7-9]

"Should I seek refuge with Hanumān, who will be able to sustain me, a deceitful Sugrīva, who is like him in appearance?" [10]

"How can those who are devoid of effort find happiness? Therefore, I will seek refuge in the best effort to destroy my sorrow." [11]

"Or perhaps Hanumān will scorn me, for I have seen him many times. Only the new moon is worshipped with love by people, not the old one." [12]

"Therefore, I will go to Rāvaṇa, who is mighty, radiant, and skilled in all the arts. He will bring me peace." [13] 

Page #288:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**270**

**14.**  The ten-headed one, ignorant of the special [knowledge] or driven by anger, might perhaps desire to kill both of us, leading to a disastrous outcome.

**15.**  One should not reveal to evil friends, the defects of mantras, disrespect, charity, merit, one's own valor, bad character, and the burning of the mind.

**16.**  Therefore, I seek refuge in the one who has vanquished Khara and Dushana in battle, he will bring me peace.

**17.**  This time is opportune due to our shared affliction, for people on earth with similar circumstances find solace in each other.

**18.**  Considering this, Sugriva, with his noble mind, sent a messenger to appease Viradha.

**19.**  When the messenger informed him of Sugriva's arrival, Viradha was filled with wonder and joy, thinking to himself: "It is amazing that Sugriva, worthy of our service, is coming to serve us. But what is impossible for a man with the power of refuge?"

**20.**  Then, hearing the thunderous sound of the drums, the city of Patala (Alankara) was filled with fear and anxiety.

**21.**  Then Lakshmana asked Viradha, "Tell me, whose trumpet sound is this that we hear?"

**22.**  He replied, "O God! This is Sugriva, the lord of the monkey clan, endowed with great strength, who has come to you with love."

**23.**  Bali and Sugriva, these two brothers are the rulers of the city of Kishkindha, sons of the radiant Sun, and are renowned throughout the world.

**24.**  Among them, Bali, known by that name, was famous for his character, valor, and other virtues. He was like Mount Meru in his pride, and did not bow down to Ravana.

**25.**  Finally, attaining supreme enlightenment and placing the prosperity of the kingdom under Sugriva's control, he entered the forest of penance, free from all worldly possessions.

**26.**  Sugriva, too, with a pure heart, was blessed with prosperity through his wife Tara. He ruled his kingdom without any obstacles, just like Hari with Sachi.

**27.**  He will grant [what is requested].

## Forty-Seventh Chapter

He, whose son, adorned with the jewels of virtues, is named Angada, and whose stories are unparalleled in the land of Kishkindha. ||28|| 

While this conversation was going on between Lakshmana and Viradhit, who were both single-minded, Sugriva arrived at the royal palace. ||29|| 

Upon being informed, the king's officials showed him great respect. After receiving permission, he entered the palace, observing the auspicious rituals. ||30|| 

O King! Lakshmana and others, who were filled with wonder and whose faces were blooming with radiance, embraced him. ||31|| 

After the customary greetings, they all sat down on the golden floor, according to the proper etiquette, and engaged in conversation, their words sweet as nectar. ||32|| 

Then, the elders introduced him to King Ramachandra, saying, "O Lord! This is Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha." ||33|| 

He is immensely wealthy, powerful, a connoisseur of pleasures, virtuous, and dearly loved by the righteous. But a wicked, deceitful Vidhyadhara has brought him to misfortune. ||34|| 

Some evil-minded Vidhyadhara, assuming his form, desires to seize his kingdom, city, army, and his beloved Sutara. ||35|| 

After the elders finished speaking, Rama looked at Sugriva. He thought to himself, "Alas! This one is even more sorrowful than I am." ||36|| 

He is like me, or perhaps even more inferior, for his enemy is directly obstructing him. ||37|| 

This task is extremely difficult. How will it be accomplished? Such a great loss is happening to him. What can someone like me do? ||38|| 

Lakshmana, who was as steadfast as Sugriva, asked Jambunada, the wise and valiant minister, the entire cause of his sorrow. ||39|| 

Then, Jambunada, the chief among the ministers, spoke with great humility, explaining the difference between the real Sugriva and the illusory Sugriva. ||40|| 

Page #290:
---------------------------
272
In the Padma Purana, O King, a wicked Vidyaadhara, captivated by the allure of a beautiful woman, assumed her form through his magic.  [41]  He remained unknown to the council of ministers and all the people.  He entered Sugreeva's inner palace, content and unaware.  [42]  Seeing him enter, the virtuous queen, Tara, spoke to her people with anxiety.  [43]  "This wicked Vidyaadhara, with a heart full of sin and devoid of good qualities, has come disguised as Sugreeva.  [44]  Do not treat him with respect as before.  This ocean of evil is difficult to cross."  [45]  Then, with a mind free of doubt, the Vidyaadhara, deep and playful, went to Sugreeva's throne and sat upon it.  [46]  Meanwhile, Bali's brother, the real Sugreeva, arrived in due course.  He saw his people in distress and asked them anxiously,  [47]  "Why are our people so dejected and downcast?  Why are they filled with sorrow and gathered in groups?"  [48]  "Has Angada, who went to Mount Meru to pay homage, been delayed?  Or has the queen, in her anger, been offended by someone?"  [49]  "Or is Vibhishana, terrified by the intense suffering of birth, death, and old age, and the various miseries of the world, gone to a forest of penance?"  [50]  Thinking thus, Sugreeva crossed the gates, adorned with jewels and magnificent arches, and entered the palace.  [51]  The palace was silent, devoid of music and conversation, as if everyone was asleep.  The guards at the gates were suspicious, as if they had assumed a different form.  [52]  Looking around the grand palace, he saw a wicked Vidyaadhara, resembling himself, sitting among the women.  [53]  He was adorned with divine ornaments and garments, radiating beauty, with a charming face adorned with beautiful earrings.  [54] 

Page #291:

## The Forty-Seventh Chapter

The enraged Sugriva roared like a thundercloud in the rainy season, his eyes blazing red like the evening sky, spreading in all directions. ||55|| Then, assuming a form similar to Sugriva's, the Vidyadhara, his face flushed with anger, stood up, intoxicated with pride like an elephant in rut, and roared fiercely. ||56|| Seeing the two mighty warriors ready to fight, their lips clenched, Sri Chandra and the other ministers quickly intervened and pacified them. ||57|| Then, Sutara said, "This is a wicked Vidyadhara. Though he appears similar in body, strength, speech, and complexion, he is not at all like my husband in terms of the auspicious marks, such as the palace, conch, pot, etc., which have been present on my husband's body for a long time and which I have seen many times. ||58-59|| The body of my husband, adorned with the marks of a great man, is as different from this lowly being as a horse is from a donkey." ||60|| Even after hearing Sutara's words, the ministers, whose minds were confused by the resemblance, disregarded her words like a wealthy man disregards the words of a poor man. ||61|| Then, all the wise ministers, their minds freed from doubt, gathered together and deliberated, saying, "The words of a drunkard, an old man, a womanizer, a child, and a woman should never be heeded by the wise." ||62-63|| "Purity of lineage is extremely rare in the world. Without it, even a vast kingdom is of no use. ||64|| Only by attaining a pure lineage can one be adorned with virtues and other qualities. Therefore, this pure inner palace must be protected with utmost care." ||65|| "To prevent Sugriva from being subjected to slander and disgrace, you must diligently separate these two." ||66|| "Anga, the son, went to the artificial Sugriva, misled by his father, while Angada, the son, went to the true Sugriva, following his mother's instructions." ||67|| 

Page #292:
---------------------------
274
We are also doubtful about our lord due to the similarity, but we are established by the words of Sutara. ||6||
Seven Akshauhinis then took refuge in one Prabhu, and the others were also under the control of another. ||6||
A false Sugriva was placed in the southern part of the city, and the real Sugriva was established in the northern part according to the rules. ||7||
The son of Bali, Chandra-rasmi, made a vow in doubt, saying that whoever goes to the door of Sutara's house will be killed by my sword, he will be killed by my sword. ||72||
Then both the monkey flags were thus established, but they were immersed in the ocean of misery, not seeing Sutara's face. ||73||
Then the true Sugriva, distressed by the separation of his beloved, went to Khara-Dushan many times to alleviate his grief. ||74||
Again, he spoke to Marut repeatedly, saying, "O friend, protect me from sorrow, be pleased." ||75||
"Some sinful Vidhyadhara, assuming my form by magic, is causing me great harm, go and kill him quickly." ||76||
Hearing the words of Sugriva, who was in such a state and grieving, Anjana's son became like a blazing fire in anger. ||77||
He mounted the Aparati-Ghat, a magnificent chariot, adorned with various ornaments, resembling a celestial abode, filled with great enthusiasm and surrounded by his ministers, and reached Kishkindha city, like a virtuous man reaching heaven. ||78-79||
Hearing that Hanuman had arrived, he quickly mounted an elephant and went out of the city with joy, like Sugriva. ||80||
Seeing that monkey flag, which had attained great similarity, Hanuman was also astonished and fell into the ocean of doubt. ||81||
He thought to himself, "Clearly, these two are Sugrivas, until I know the difference..." ||82||

Page #293:
---------------------------
The Forty-Seventh Chapter

275. Without knowing the difference between these two monkey kings, I might kill Sugriva, the best of friends. ||83||

Having consulted with his ministers for a moment, and having considered the matter properly, Maruti, with indifference, went back to his city. ||84||

When the son of Marut returned, Sugriva was very distressed. And the other, who was like him, remained in the same way, full of hope. ||85||

Although Sugriva is endowed with thousands of kinds of magic, is very powerful, a great achiever, and wields weapons like meteors, even he is filled with doubt. This is a great hardship. ||86||

O God! This Sugriva, who is submerged in the ocean of doubt, filled with crocodiles of misfortune, who will save him, I do not know. ||87||

O Raghunandan! Be pleased to accept the service of this Sugriva, whose banner is ablaze with the fire of separation from his beloved, and who is grateful for favors. ||88||

This one has come to your refuge, who is kind to those who seek refuge. Indeed, the body of a great man like you is the destroyer of the suffering of others. ||89||

Then, hearing his words, all those whose minds were filled with wonder, began to utter words like "Fie!" and "Alas!" ||90||

Rama thought, "Now, because of this sorrow, I have another friend, for love often arises between those who are alike." ||91||

If this one is not able to reciprocate my kindness, then I will become a homeless ascetic and achieve liberation. ||92||

Thinking thus, and after consulting with Viradha and others for a moment, Padma-nabha called Sugriva and said to him: ||93||

"Whether you are the real Sugriva or the false Sugriva, I want you. I will kill the other Sugriva who is like you, and give you your own position." ||94||

"Obtain your kingdom as before, and having destroyed all your enemies, be happy and come to me with your wife." ||95||

If I find Sita, who is dearer to me than life itself, and who is full of virtues, O Bhadra, it will be a great blessing. ||96||
Hearing this, Sugriva said, "If I do not find your beloved within seven days, I will enter the fire." ||97||
Rama, who was like a lotus, was filled with joy by these words of Sugriva, which were like the rays of the moon. ||98||
His face, like a blooming lotus, was bathed in the nectar of joy, and his body was filled with thrills. ||99||
"We are free from treachery towards each other, we are friends," they said with respect, and took the Jain oath in that very temple. ||100||
Then, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by their great ministers, mounted a fine chariot and set out for Kishkindha. ||101||
When they reached the city, Sugriva, who wore a monkey emblem on his crown, sent a messenger, who was insulted by the deceitful Sugriva and returned. ||102||
Then, the deceitful Sugriva, filled with anger, mounted his chariot, surrounded by a large army, and set out for battle. ||103||
Then, a great battle began between the two armies, which was full of treachery, danger, and loud noises. ||104||
Sugriva, who was full of fierce anger and devoted to the practice of knowledge, was ready to fight fiercely against the deceitful Sugriva, who raised his head in arrogance. ||105||
A great battle took place between the two Sugrivas, who did not tire even after fighting for a long time. Their battle filled the sky with darkness, as they used weapons like discs, arrows, and swords. ||106||
Then, the deceitful Sugriva, having struck Sugriva with his mace, and thinking that he was dead, entered the city with satisfaction. ||107||
On the other hand, the body of Sugriva, who was lying motionless,

The awakened one said, "O Lord, the thief who came into my hand is alive. How did he return to my city?" ||109||

"Surely, O Raghava, there will be no end to my sorrow, and even after attaining you, what greater suffering can there be?" ||110||

Then Padma Prabhu said, "I did not know the difference between you two while fighting, so I did not kill the one who was like you." ||111||

"Because of the fault of ignorance, I have always been afraid of destroying you, my dear friend, by uttering the Jain words, which have created a bond of love." ||112||

Then, the counterfeit Sugriva, who was like the real one, was called again. He came, blazing with the fire of anger, and faced Padma. ||113||

Like the ocean agitated by a mountain, the counterfeit Sugriva, filled with the movement of a multitude of cruel warriors like crocodiles, was agitated by Rama. ||114||

Lakshmana embraced the real Sugriva tightly and held him, saying, "Don't go near the enemy because of your anger towards women." ||115||

Then, Rama, shining like a lotus, called out to the counterfeit Sugriva, blazing with the great energy born from the attainment of battle. ||116||

Then, seeing Padma, he asked the accomplished one, "The Vaitali Vidya has come out of his body, like a woman who has taken on a bold posture." ||117||

Seeing the one who was devoid of Sugriva's form, whose monkey mark was gone, who looked like an Indra-nila gem, and who was in his natural form, as if he had come out of a covering, all the monkey warriors were agitated and took refuge in unity. ||118-119||

The powerful monkeys, armed with various weapons, angry, fought him, saying, "This is he, this is he, look, look." ||120||

That powerful one, with his vast strength, drove that army of enemies forward, so that they fled in all directions, like cotton before the wind. ||121||

Thus, the real Sugriva was brought to his camp by his friends. ||108||

Having strung his bow, the valiant one, resembling a mountain of wealth, ran towards Padma.  He showered him with arrows, making the space between them a torrent of shafts. The son of Kakutstha established a pavilion of arrows.  

The battle between him and the valiant Saahasayana was a fitting one, for he who fights for a long time brings joy to Padma.  

Then, after engaging in a long and glorious battle, the son of Raghu severed the armor of Kshurapresya with his arrows.  

The body of Saahasayana, riddled with sharp arrows, became like a sieve.  He fell to the earth, his radiance gone, embracing the ground.  

All the curious Vidyadharas gathered around and recognized him with certainty as the wicked Saahasayana.  

Then, along with his brother, Sugreeva worshipped Rama, praising him with beautiful hymns, filled with great joy.  

He went to meet his beloved, carrying the utmost longing, to bring about the ultimate beauty in the city, free from thorns.  

He was so immersed in the ocean of pleasures that he did not know day or night.  He had been seen after a long time, and so he had surrendered all his consciousness to the Sutara.  

After spending one night outside the city, Rama and the other kings, accompanied by their mighty forces, entered Kishkindha with great splendor.  

They settled in the Anandavana, a garden that rivaled the beauty of Nandana, enjoying themselves as freely as the guardians of the world.  

To describe this garden is to describe its beauty beyond words.  Who is capable of describing its virtues?  

There was a beautiful temple in the garden, adorned with the image of Chandra Prabha.  Rama and Lakshmana, after bowing to Chandra Prabha, the destroyer of all obstacles, resided there.

The type of cotton that is obtained by the wind.  

At that time, the valiant Saahasayana, resembling a cloud, with his bow strung and arrows ready, ran towards Rama.  

On the other side, Rama was also showering him with a torrent of arrows, creating a pavilion of arrows.  

Thus, the battle between Rama and the valiant Saahasayana was a fitting one, for he who fights for a long time brings joy to Padma.  

Then, after engaging in a long and glorious battle, Ramachandra, the bearer of great valor, pierced his armor with arrows.  

After that, Saahasayana, whose body was riddled with sharp arrows, became like a sieve.  He fell to the earth, his radiance gone, embracing the ground.  

All the curious Vidyadharas gathered around and recognized him with certainty as the wicked Saahasayana.

279.  Outside the Chaitya-alaya, Chandrodara's sons, having settled their army, were free from fatigue. ||135||

Inspired by the stories of the virtues of Rama, the thirteen daughters of Sugriva, with the desire for self-choice, went there with joy. ||136||

The first was Chandrabha, with a face like the moon, the second was Hridyaavali, the third was Hridya-dharma, who was like a thorn in the heart, the fourth was Anundhara, the fifth was Shrikant, like the second Lakshmi, the sixth was Sundari, beautiful in every way, the seventh was Suravati, who was like a celestial woman, the eighth was Manovahini, skilled in controlling the mind, the ninth was Charushri, known for her beauty, the tenth was Madanotsava, who was like the festival of Madan, the eleventh was Gunavati, adorned with a garland of virtues, the twelfth was Padmavati, with a face like a blooming lotus, and the thirteenth was Jinamati, always devoted to the worship of the Jinas. Taking all these daughters, their entourage went to Rama. ||137-142||

Saluting Rama, he said, "O Lord! You are the refuge of these daughters in their self-choice. O Lokesh! You are the best friend of these daughters." ||143||

Hearing the name of the protector of their lineage, the daughters' hearts naturally felt that their marriage should not be with the lowly Vidhyadharas. ||144||

Then, burdened with shyness, their faces bowed, adorned with beauty, their radiance like a lotus, and filled with youthful vigor, all the daughters went to King Ramachandra. ||145||

Their bodies, shining like lightning, fire, gold, and the inner petals of a lotus, illuminated the sky with their brilliance. ||146||

With graceful, elegant bodies and dignified manners, all the daughters sat down near Rama. ||147||

## Forty-eighth Chapter

Then, desiring to please Sri Rama, the excellent maidens began to perform various actions. These maidens seemed to have come from the celestial realms. ||1||

They played on the veena and other instruments, sang most enchanting songs, and engaged in graceful sports and pastimes. Yet, none of these actions could stir Rama's heart. ||2||

Although he was surrounded by an abundance of all kinds of pleasures, his mind remained fixed on Sita, not swayed by the allure of worldly delights. ||3||

Like a sage absorbed in meditation on liberation, Rama, with unwavering devotion, focused solely on Sita, disregarding all other pursuits. ||4||

He did not hear the words of those maidens, nor did he see their forms. To him, the entire world was filled with Sita. ||5||

He spoke only of Sita, never of anything else. Even if he addressed another woman standing nearby, he would do so as if she were Sita. ||6||

With affection, he would ask the crow, "Brother, you travel far and wide. Have you seen Sita anywhere?" ||7||

Seeing a pair of chakwas (male and female geese) playing in a lake adorned with the pollen of blooming lotuses, he would fall into deep thought and become angry. ||8||

Fearing that the wind might have touched Sita, he would close his eyes and embrace it with great respect. ||9||

He considered the earth blessed because Sita had sat upon it. He looked at the moon as if it were despised by Sita's radiance. ||10||

He would ponder, "Has Sita been consumed by the fire of my separation? Has she reached the state of those who suffer misfortune?" ||11||

"Is this Sita? Or is it just a creeper swaying in the gentle breeze? Is this a piece of cloth, or a cluster of leaves fluttering in the wind?" ||12|| 

Page #300:
---------------------------
282
Is this her garment, or a cluster of fluttering leaves?  ||12|| Are these her eyes, or flowers with bees? And is this her moving hand, or a new shoot? ||13|| I see her beautiful hair-knot in the peacocks, her forehead's beauty in the half-moon, her eyes' beauty in the three-colored lotuses, her gentle smile's beauty in the flower amidst the red leaves, her breasts' beauty in the well-formed, lustrous clusters, her middle's beauty in the middle of the Jina-abhisheka platforms, her hips' full form in the upper part of those platforms, her thighs' incomparable beauty in the beautiful pillars of the banana tree, and her feet's beauty in the lotus of the earth, that is, the rose flower. But I do not see Sita's beauty in the totality of all these. ||14-18||
Why is that Sugriva delaying without reason? Has he, the seer of auspicious things, inquired about Sita from anyone? ||19|| Or does he know that she, the virtuous one, has perished, consumed by grief at my separation, and yet, unable to speak, does he not come into my sight? ||20|| Or has he, the celestial being, attained his goal, having obtained his kingdom again, and, having become happy, forgotten my sorrow and immersed himself in his own joy? ||21|| Thinking thus, Lakshmana, whose eyes were filled with tears and whose body was slack and languid, understood Rama's intention. ||22||
Then, with his mind agitated, his eyes red with anger, and his hand adorned with a naked sword, Lakshmana went towards Sugriva. ||23|| As he went, the wind generated by the pillars of his legs caused the entire city to tremble, as if it were trembling from a great calamity. ||24|| Throwing down all the king's officials with his speed, he entered Sugriva's house and said to him: ||25|| Oh, sinner! While the Lord Rama is immersed in the sorrow of his wife, how, O foolish one, do you enjoy happiness with a woman? ||26||

## Chapter 283

27. "O vile Vidhyadhara, I will take you to the place where Rama took the artificial Sugriva who had assumed your form."

28. Thus, Sugriva pacified Lakshmana, who was giving vent to his anger like sparks from a fire, by prostrating before him.

29. And he said, "O Lord, forgive me this one mistake, for such vile deeds are common to men like me."

30. Sugriva's wives, their bodies trembling with fear, came out with arghya in their hands and, prostrating themselves, completely dispelled Lakshmana's anger.

31. Just as fire born from the arani (fire-stick) of human beings is quickly extinguished by the water of the clouds, which are the words of the virtuous, so too, anger is quickly extinguished.

32. The peace of mind of great men is attained merely by prostration, while wicked men cannot be pacified even by great gifts.

33. Remembering his promise, Lakshmana did a great favor to Sugriva, just as the sage Yakshadatt did to his mother.

34. In the meantime, King Srenika asked Ganadhara, "O Lord, I wish to know the story of Yakshadatt."

35. Then Ganadhara said, "O King Srenika, listen! I will tell you the story of how the sage Yakshadatt remembered his mother."

36. There is a city called Kraunchapur, where there was a king named Yaksha, and his wife was known as Rajila.

37. Their son, named Yakshadatt, was enjoying himself outside the city when he saw a beautiful woman living in the quarters of the poor.

38. His heart was pierced by the arrows of love, and he was going to her at night when the sage, who knew the future, said, "No!"

39. At that moment, lightning flashed, and in its light, Yakshadatt, who was carrying a sword, saw the sage Ayan sitting under a tree.

40. He went to him, bowed down, and asked respectfully, "O Lord, why did you forbid me by saying 'No'? I am very curious."

Padma Purana
The Muni said, "You are lustful and were about to go towards her. She is your mother, so I stopped you saying, 'Don't go.'" || 41 || Yakshadatt asked, "How is she my mother?" The Muni then narrated this story, for the minds of Munis are filled with compassion. || 42 || Listen, in the city of Mrtikavati, there lived a merchant named Kanak. His wife, Dhūr, gave birth to a son named Bandhudatt. || 43 || Bandhudatt's wife was named Mitravati, the daughter of Latadatt. Once, Bandhudatt impregnated Mitravati without her knowledge and left for another place by ship. || 44 || Later, when his in-laws learned about the pregnancy, they considered it a sin and expelled her from the city. The pregnant Mitravati, along with her maid, Utpalika, left for her father's house with a large caravan. But in the forest, Utpalika was bitten by a snake and died. || 45-46 || Then, bereft of her friend, Mitravati, with only her good conduct as her companion, arrived in this city of Kraunchapur, overwhelmed with grief. || 47 || In the garden of the deity, Sphyta, she gave birth to a son. Later, she wrapped the child in a jeweled blanket and went to wash clothes in a nearby lake. While she was gone, a dog took the child away. || 48 || The dog was the king's beloved pet, so it carried the child, wrapped in the jeweled blanket, to the king, Yaks. || 49 || The king gave the child to his queen, Rajila, who was childless, and named him Yakshadatt, because Yaks was the name of the dog and the child was given by him. You are that Yakshadatt. || 50 || When Mitravati returned and did not see her son, she lamented for a long time in sorrow. || 51 || Then, the deity of the garden, Sphyta, saw her and comforted her with compassion. He said, "You are my sister," and kept her in his own dwelling. || 52 || Due to lack of support, shame, or fear of disgrace, she did not go to her father's house and stayed there. || 53 ||

The forty-eighth chapter.

She, being very virtuous and devoted to the Jain religion, was sitting in the hut of a poor devacharya. You saw her while wandering. || 54 || The jeweled blanket that her husband Bandhudatta gave her when he went abroad is still kept safe in the house of the king Yaksha. || 55 || Having said this, he bowed down to the benevolent Muni Raja and praised him greatly. Then, with a sword in hand, he quickly went to the king Yaksha. || 56 || And said, "If you do not tell me the true reason for my birth clearly, I will cut off your head with this sword." || 57 || Having said this, the king Yaksha told him everything as it was and, showing him the jeweled blanket, said, "This is still smeared with the placenta." || 58 || Then, he had a union with his former parents and there was a great festival, which amazed everyone with its grandeur. || 59 || Gautama Swami says, "O King! Since the subject has come up, I have told you this story. Now I will tell you the main point, so listen carefully." || 60 || Then, Sugriva, putting Lakshmana in front, quickly went to Rama and stood there, having bowed down. || 61 || Then, with pride in his prowess, he called all the servants who always acted openly and were born in noble families. He told those servants who had not heard this story about Rama's wonderful work, and they were amazed. || 62-63 || And, honoring those servants who knew this story and were devoted to the work of the Lord, he spoke to them in order to reciprocate their kindness. || 64 || "O all you men who are adorned with excellent virtues and are blessed with wealth! Quickly find out where Sita is." || 65 || "You are all endowed with various kinds of knowledge and prowess, so search for her in this entire earth, in the netherworld, in the sky, in water, on land, in Jambudvipa, in the ocean, in the Ghataki Khand island, in the groves of the Kulachala mountains, in the forests, on Mount Meru, in various beautiful cities, in the sky, in all the dense forests, in all directions, and in the caves of the earth." || 66-68 ||

The proud monkeys, like the remaining serpents, placed Sugriva's command on their heads and, filled with joy, quickly flew in all directions. ||65|| A young Vidyaadhara, having sent a letter according to the proper procedure, informed the Bhamandala of all that had happened. ||70|| Then, overwhelmed with grief for his sister, the Bhamandala became deeply distressed and, like Sugriva, became extremely obedient to Rama. ||71|| Sugriva himself, accompanied by a cluster of stars, set out on a celestial journey to search for Sita. ||72|| He was eager to search for Sita among the many cities of the wicked Vidyaadharas. While traveling, he saw a flag waving in the distance from the peak of a mountain in Jambudvipa. At that time, the hem of his garment was fluttering in the wind. ||73-74|| The Vidyaadhara Ratnakeshi resided on that mountain. Seeing Sugriva's radiant chariot descending from the sky like the sun, he was filled with fear of a calamity. ||75|| Seeing the chariot, he was utterly terrified and, like a serpent frightened by Garuda, he cowered in fear. ||76|| When Sugriva came very close, Ratnakeshi recognized him as a Vanara from his flag and, overwhelmed with fear of death, he was filled with anxiety. ||77|| It seems I have offended the king of Lanka, Ravana. Perhaps he has sent Sugriva to destroy me in his anger. ||78|| Alas, why did I not die quickly by falling into the fearsome salt sea? I am cursed to die on this other island. ||79|| I am devoid of knowledge and power, yet I cling to life for the sake of my desires. What will I achieve now? ||80|| While Ratnakeshi was thinking this, Sugriva, illuminating the island like a second sun, arrived there quickly. ||81|| Seeing the monkey flag, covered in dust from the forest, the compassionate Ratnakeshi asked, ||82||

In the end, search for Sita in the Sumeru mountains, in the beautiful and diverse cities of the Vidyaadharas, in all directions, and in the caves and crevices of the earth. ||66-68|| 

Page #305:

## The Forty-Eighth Chapter

Seeing Ratnajati, whose entire body was trembling, Sugriva, filled with compassion, asked, "You, Ratnajati, were once elevated by knowledge. O noble one, why have you fallen into this state?" ||83||

Even though Sugriva, the bearer of good tidings, spoke to him with compassion, Ratnajati trembled all over with fear and appeared extremely dejected. ||84||

Sugriva repeatedly said, "Do not fear, do not fear," and then, regaining his composure, Ratnajati bowed and said in clear words, "O virtuous one, the wicked Ravana, intent on abducting Sita, opposed me and stole my knowledge, leaving me in this state." ||85-86||

"O chief of the monkeys, by the grace of fate, I have somehow managed to survive and stand here, holding this flag." ||87||

Having received the news, Sugriva, bearing the joy and anxiety of the situation, quickly took Ratnajati and went towards his city. ||88||

Then, with humility, Ratnajati, joining his hands, spoke to Rama in the presence of Lakshmana and other great celestial beings, "O Lord, the extremely wicked Ravana, the king of Lanka, has abducted the virtuous Sita and stolen my knowledge, which I possess due to my anger." ||89-90||

"He abducted Sita, who was wailing loudly with a heart-wrenching sound, making her distraught like a deer." ||91||

"He, who defeated the mighty Indra, the lord of the celestial beings, in a fierce battle and imprisoned him." ||92||

"He, who is the undisputed master of the three divisions of the Bharata land, who gained immense fame by lifting Mount Kailasa, whose command is awaited by the earth, stretching to the ocean, and whom even the gods and demons combined cannot defeat, he, the best among the learned, the discerning of dharma and adharma, has committed this cruel act. It must be said that the delusion of the wicked is very powerful." ||93-95||

Hearing this, Rama, filled with various kinds of affection, embraced Ratnajati with love and respect. ||96||

And, Ratnajati, whose lineage had ruled the city of Devopagit, was restored to his rightful position as king, which had been usurped by his enemies for a long time. ||97||

Padma Purana
Again and again, the king, embracing him, asked for the news, and he, overwhelmed with joy, spoke the news again and again. ||18||
Then, filled with great curiosity, Rama asked quickly, "O celestial beings, tell me, how far is Lanka?" ||99||
Thus addressed, they were freed from their delusion, their bodies became motionless, they became speechless, their radiance gone, devoid of words. ||100||
Knowing their intention, Rama looked at them with a disdainful gaze, their hearts filled with fear. ||101||
Then, terrified, they were ashamed, knowing that they had been seen by Rama. With trembling minds, they clasped their hands and bowed their heads. ||102||
"O Lord, even the mere utterance of his name brings fear and fever. How can we speak before you?" ||103||
"We are but beings of small power, and he is the lord of Lanka. Abandon this insistence now that you know the truth." ||104||
"But, O Lord, this matter must be heard. Please listen. What harm is there in speaking before you? Can anything be said?" ||105||
"In this salt ocean, filled with cruel crocodiles, there is a famous island of the Rakshasas, full of wonders." ||106||
"It is seven hundred yojanas wide on all sides, and its circumference is twenty-one yojanas more." ||107||
"In its midst is a mountain called Trikuta, like Mount Mandara, nine yojanas high and fifty yojanas wide." ||108||
"It is adorned with gold and various gems, and covered with a network of rocks. It was given by the Rakshasa king to Meghavahana as a dwelling place." ||109||
"On the peak of Trikuta, adorned with various beautiful trees, lies the city of Lanka, shining with the rays of gems and jewels, with beautiful palaces like celestial chariots, and delightful places suitable for play and other activities." ||110-111||
"It is thirty yojanas wide on all sides, surrounded by a great rampart and a moat, and a second earth." ||112||

The forty-eighth chapter.

There are other beautiful regions near Lanka, which are made of gems, jewels and gold.  These regions are adorned with excellent cities, are the play grounds of the Rakshasas and are inhabited by the Vidyadharas who enjoy great pleasures.  

Sandhyakar, Suvel, Kanchan, Hladan, Yodhan, Hans, Harisagar and Ardha-Svarga are some other islands which are endowed with all kinds of riches and pleasures, are adorned with forests and gardens and resemble the regions of heaven.

The king of Lanka, Ravana, surrounded by his retinue, enjoys himself in these regions with his friends, brothers, sons, wives and other relatives.

Seeing the king of the Vidyadharas playing, I think even Indra would be filled with fear.

His brother Vibhishana is very powerful in the world, invincible in battle and the best among kings.

Even among the gods, there is no one who can equal him in intelligence, let alone a human being.  The king of the world, Ravana, is fortunate to have such a brother.

He has another brother, adorned with virtues, who is known as Kumbhakarna and is armed with the great weapon, the Trishul.

Even the gods cannot bear to look at his terrible, crooked frown, which resembles the cave of Yama.

Indrajit, who has gained fame in battle, is his son.  The whole world seems to be in his hands.

Thus, Ravana has many servants like these, who are endowed with various miraculous powers and have subdued their enemies through their prowess.

Seeing his umbrella, which shines like the full moon, enemies abandon their pride in battle.

Even a mere image or picture of him, or even his name uttered, is enough to strike terror in the hearts of his enemies.

Who is capable of defeating such a Ravana in battle?  This story should not be told, let us think of another way. 

Page #308:
---------------------------
290
Seeing each of them with disdain, Lakshmana, whose voice was like the roar of a cloud, spoke these powerful words: "If Ravana is truly known to be so powerful, then why is he a thief of women, whose name is not even fit to be heard?" ||128-129|| "He is a hypocrite, a coward, a deceiver, a doer of evil deeds, a vile Rakshasa. Where is even a little bit of bravery in him?" ||130|| 
Padmanabha said, "What is the point of saying more about this? By good fortune, we have obtained the news, which was difficult to get." ||131|| "There is no need to think about anything else now. Let that vile Rakshasa be agitated. The fruit of his actions, driven by the wind of karma, will be appropriate." ||132||
Then, after staying for a moment, the elders said respectfully, "Padmaabha! Give up your sorrow. Be our master. Be the husband of the Vidyaadhara princesses, who are equal to Apsaras in their qualities. Wander the world with joy, free from all sorrow." ||133-134||
Rama replied, "I have no need for other women, even if they surpass the great beauty of Indrani." ||135|| "O Vidyaadharas! If you have any affection or compassion for me, then show Sita to me quickly." ||136||
Then Jambunada said, "O Lord! Give up this foolish stubbornness. Do not be distressed like a petty man over a fake peacock." ||137|| "Listen to this story I tell you.
There was a householder named Sarvaruchi living in the city of Venatat. He had a son named Vinayadatta, born to his wife Gunapurna." ||138|| "Vinayadatta had a very dear friend named Vishalabhuuti. This wicked man became attached to Vinayadatta's wife, Grihalakshmi." ||139|| "One day, at the instigation of that woman, Vishalabhuuti took Vinayadatta to the forest under the pretense of going for a walk and tied him to a tree." ||140|| "After tying him up, the cruel Vishalabhuuti, with a wicked heart, returned home and...

291. In the meantime, a man named Ksudra, having lost his way, wandered about in distress and came upon that tree. ||342|| Seeing the shade of the tree, he went under it to rest. He heard the faint sound of Vinayadatta's groaning and looked up. ||343|| He saw Vinayadatta bound with strong ropes at the top of a very tall branch, his body motionless. ||344|| Ksudra, whose heart was filled with compassion, climbed up and freed him. Then Vinayadatta descended and took Ksudra with him to his home. ||345|| There was great joy in Vinayadatta's house at his return, and Vishalabhuuti fled upon seeing him. ||346|| Ksudra stayed at Vinayadatta's house. He had a toy peacock made of peacock feathers, which one day was blown away by the wind and reached the prince. ||347|| Ksudra was deeply grieved at the loss of his artificial peacock and said to his friend, "My friend, if you want me to live, give me back my artificial peacock." ||348|| "I freed you from your bonds on that tree, so give me this return for my great favor." ||349|| Vinayadatta replied, "Take another peacock, or a gem or a jewel, but how can I give you that peacock?" ||350|| Ksudra insisted, "No, give me that peacock." Ksudra was foolish and stubborn, but you, being a noble man, are also being stubborn. ||351|| Tell me, how can you get back the artificial peacock that has reached the prince's hands? Only those who ask from the prince can expect death. ||352|| Therefore, O Raghunandan, give up your desire for Sita and become the husband of those women whose eyes are white, black, and red, whose radiance is like gold, whose breasts are full and round, whose hips are wide and beautiful, whose faces are more radiant than the moon, and who are endowed with many other beautiful qualities. Enjoy great pleasures and be happy. ||353-354|| Give up this humorous and sorrow-increasing stubbornness and...

Do not abandon this humorous anecdote from the Padma Purana, which increases sorrow. Do not be like a peacock feather, grieving like a small creature, O wise one! [155] Women are always easily available to men, like peacock feathers. I tell you, Raghava, the wise do not hold onto sorrow. [156]
Then Lakshmana, who was extremely skilled in the art of speech, said, "O Jambunada, this is not like that, but like this, listen." [157]
There was a famous householder named Prabhava in the city of Kusumapura. His wife was known as Yamuna. [158]
They had five sons named Dhanapala, Bandhupala, Grihapala, Kshetrapala, and Pashupala. [159]
All these sons had meaningful names and were always dedicated to the welfare of their family, and they never took a moment's rest from their work. [160]
The youngest of them was a son named Atmasreya, who enjoyed pleasures like a divine prince due to his good deeds. [161]
He was constantly criticized by his brothers and parents with harsh words because he did nothing. One day, he left home in anger and wandered outside the city. [162]
He had a very delicate body and was unable to do anything, so he became extremely despondent and desired to die. [163]
At that time, a traveler, inspired by the influence of his past karma, came to him and said, "O man, listen!" [164]
"I am Subhanu, the son of the king of Prithustana. Following the instructions of a wise man, I have been wandering through many countries until now. [165]
Wandering on this earth, I reached the city of Kurmapura by divine will. There, I met a worthy teacher. [166]
Being afflicted by the hardships of the journey, that compassionate teacher gave me this iron bracelet. [167]
This bracelet is a cure for all diseases, increases intelligence, and is an excellent means of controlling planets, serpents, and ghosts. [168]

The Forty-Eighth Chapter
293
The time appointed by the knower of omens has arrived for me to depart. I am now going to my own city to rule my kingdom. ||169||
For one who dwells in a kingdom, countless follies arise. And this is a sure cause of destruction, if one falls prey to them. ||170||
"Take this, I give you this excellent bangle. If you desire a life free from calamities, then take it." ||171||
Giving away what one has obtained is praised as bearing great fruit. One gains fame in the world and people worship him. ||172||
Having said this, he took the iron bangle and went to his own abode, and Subhanu also went to his own city. ||173||
Meanwhile, the king's wife had been bitten by a snake and was rendered motionless. She was brought to the cremation ground to be burned. Atma-shreya saw her. ||174||
And seeing her, by the grace of that iron bangle, he revived her and received great honor from the king. ||175||
Now, by the influence of his virtuous deeds, he obtained great enjoyments, bringing supreme happiness, along with all his relatives. ||176||
Once, he placed the bangle on his upper garment and entered a lake. A fierce, wild Ghodher (a kind of serpent) took it away. ||177||
That Ghodher entered its large burrow, situated beneath a great tree. The burrow was covered with a heap of stones, inaccessible and filled with a terrible sound. ||178||
That Ghodher, sitting in its burrow, made a continuous sound, which made the sight of the burrow inspire fear of destruction in the mind. ||179||
Then Atma-shreya uprooted the tree, which was dense with stones, and killed the Ghodher, taking back the bangle and all its treasure. ||180||
So Rama is like Atma-shreya, Sita is like the bangle, the desire for gain is like folly, the sound of the enemy is like the sound of the Ghodher, Lanka is like the great treasure, Ravana is like the Ghodher. Therefore, O Vidyadharas, be fearless now. ||181-182||
1. Take this, I give you this excellent bangle. ||171||
2. Having taken the bangle. ||173||
3. Bitten by a snake. ||174||
4. At the cremation ground. ||174||
5. From afar. ||174||

Padma Purana
Hearing this account of Lakshmana, which was narrated by Jambunada, many people were filled with wonder and smiled. ||183|| Jambunada and all the others, after deliberating, said to Padma, "O King, listen attentively." ||184||  Previously, Ravana had respectfully saluted the yogi-indra, Anantavirya, and asked him the cause of his death. The yogi-indra replied, "Whoever will lift the incomparable, meritorious, and Nirvana-granting Shila, which is worshipped by the gods, will be the cause of your death." ||185-186|| Hearing this statement of the omniscient, Ravana pondered, "Who will be that man, and who will be capable of lifting it?" ||187||  The meaning of the Lord's words is that there is no cause for my death. This is correct, because the word-arrangement of the wise is intricate in the explanation of meaning. ||188||
Then Lakshmana said, "Let us go, there is no benefit in delay. We will see the Siddha Shila, which brings joy to all beings." ||189||  After that, all of them, after deliberating among themselves and being certain from all sides, abandoned all carelessness and were eager to go with Lakshmana. ||190|| Jambunada, the great intellect, Sugriva, the lord of Kishkindha, Viradhit, Arkamali, the extremely wise Nal and Neel, placed Rama and Lakshmana on the chariot with honor and quickly departed through the sky in the dense darkness of night. ||191-192||  And they descended near where that extremely beautiful, supremely deep, and worshipped by gods and demons, Siddha Shila was. ||193||  Then, with careful minds, they went forward, appointed the guardians of the directions, and all of them, with folded hands, went near that Siddha Shila with their heads bowed. ||194||  There, they worshipped that Shila with extremely fragrant, large lotuses, which were as beautiful as the full moon's disc, and with various other flowers. ||195||
That Shila, which was smeared with white sandalwood, adorned with saffron-colored garments, and decorated with various ornaments, appeared like Indrani at that time. ||196||

295. Having bowed to the Siddhas, the learned ones, with their hands joined and touching their foreheads, circumambulated the stone, in order, according to the prescribed rituals. ||197||

Then, tying their garments, bearing the humility of the virtuous, the devotee, devoted to prostration, prepared to offer praise. ||198||

The monkey-bannered kings, filled with joy, uttered the word "Victory!" and began to recite this excellent auspicious hymn of the Siddhas. ||199||

Standing on the peak of the three worlds, in their own supreme voice, they praised those who are established in the state of their own nature, free from rebirth, ||200||

who have crossed the ocean of existence, are born of supreme welfare, are the foundation of the happiness of liberation, and are endowed with perfect knowledge and perfect vision. ||201||

They praised those who are endowed with infinite power, established in their own nature, possessed of excellence, and whose all karmas have been exhausted. ||202||

They praised those who are endowed with the virtue of immersion, are formless, possess the quality of subtlety, are devoid of heaviness and lightness, and are of countless regions. ||203||

They praised those who are the foundation of immeasurable qualities, free from sequence and so on, equal in nature, and who have attained the ultimate goal of self-purpose. ||204||

They praised those whose essence is pure, who have known all that is knowable, who are free from the stain of karma, and who have burnt the forest of karma with the fire of pure meditation. ||205||

They praised those who are terrified of the world, surrounded by a veil of light, and who are praised by Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, and the Chakravartin, and others. ||206||

We bow to all the Siddhas, who are free from the laws of the world, who have attained the Dharma of the Siddhas, and who are the embodiment of all Siddhis. ||207||

We bow again and again, with devotion, to those who have attained Siddhi, who are the upholders of virtue, who are mentioned in the Puranas, who are free from all karmas, who have attained the equality of the Jinas, who have fulfilled their purpose, and who are mighty. ||208-209||

The beautiful one was pleased. ||196|| 

1. With hands joined and touching their foreheads. ||
2. Born of supreme welfare. ||

296
Having praised thus for a long time, the Vidyaadharas, with their minds fixed on Lakshmana, spoke again.  Addressing Lakshmana, they said: "Those Siddhas who have attained liberation on this rock, and all those who have destroyed their karmas, may they all be auspicious for you.  May the Arhats be auspicious for you, may the Siddhas be auspicious for you, may all the Sadhus be auspicious for you, and may the Jina-shaasana be auspicious for you."  With these auspicious words, Lakshmana, the bearer of great radiance, quickly moved the rock.  Lakshmana, the son of Kumara, lifted the rock, adorned with various ornaments, with his arms, as if it were a beautiful bride.  Then a great sound arose in the sky, and the kings, including Sugriva, were filled with great wonder.  Then, bowing to the Siddhas, free from fear, and to the Jina, Muni-Suvrata, who resides on the Sammed Shikhar, they said: "We have circumambulated the entire Bharat Kshetra, as per the rules, bowing to the Tirthankaras, starting with Rishabha, and to the Aryas."  In the evening, with their divine vehicles, swift as the mind, they, the bearers of auspicious bodies, surrounded Rama and Lakshmana, with great reverence, and entered Kishkindha Nagar, uttering the words "Victory" and "Joy."  They lay down in their respective places, and then, with their minds filled with wonder, they gathered together and spoke to each other with great joy.  "You will see, in a few days, that the kingdom of these two, who possess great power, will be free from all thorns, that is, enemies, on this earth."  "This Lakshmana, who lifted the Nirvana-Shila, will surely kill Ravana soon."  Some said, "Is Ravana, who lifted Kailasa, equal to this one who lifted the rock?"  Others said, "If Ravana lifted Mount Kailasa, then what is there to wonder at, since he did it by the power of his knowledge?"

**297** Some said, "What is the use of these pointless arguments? Why isn't a solution for the welfare of the world and the sake of peace being devised?" **225** "Therefore, let Sita be brought back, and let Ravana be appeased. I will give her to Raghava. What is the purpose of war?" **226** "In the battle, Taraka, the mighty Meruka, and the sons of Kritavirya, along with their vast armies, have been destroyed." **227** "These were the lords of the three continents, great and powerful. Many other kings, vassals and others, have been destroyed in the battle." **228** "Thus, all the wise men, skilled in the use of knowledge, consulted each other and, with humility and respect, came together to Rama." **229** "Sugriva and others, seated around Rama, who brought joy to their eyes, shone like the gods around Indra." **230** "Then, Padma-Nabha said, 'What are we waiting for? Without me, Sita must be suffering in the other island.'" **231** "Let us abandon procrastination and, without delay, all of us go to Trikuta. Why is there no effort being made?" **232** "The wise old ministers replied, 'O Lord, what is the doubt here? Tell us with certainty.' **233** "Do you desire Sita, or do you want to fight the Rakshasas? Victory will be hard-won, for this war is not between equals." **234** "For Ravana is the undisputed lord of the three continents, renowned in the islands and the oceans. He is the only one who has no rival." **235** "Even the island of Dhataki, which is feared even by the celestial beings, is afraid of him. He has attained supreme glory in Jambudvipa, and is the lord of the celestial beings." **236** "He is a thorn in the side of the entire world, and has performed many wondrous deeds. How can such a Rakshasa be conquered by you, O Rama?" **237** "Therefore, O Lord, abandon your warlike thoughts and do what we are saying. Be pleased and act for peace." **238** "Let not the world be filled with fear by his anger. Let not the armies be destroyed, and let not all the stars be extinguished." 

**What happened, because with the power of knowledge, who can be surprised by his actions?** **224**

In the Padma Purana, Vibhishana is known as Brahma himself. He is always free from cruel deeds and firmly adheres to the Anuvrata. ||240|| The king of the celestial beings considers his word inviolable. For there is a supreme, uninterrupted light between them. ||241|| Vibhishana will persuade him, or out of generosity, or for the sake of protecting his honor, or out of shame, Ravana will send Sita. ||242|| Therefore, quickly find a man skilled in the art of persuasive speech, adept in diplomacy, and capable of pleasing Ravana. ||243||
Then, the king of the Vidyadharas, known as Mahodadhi, said, "Has this news not reached your ears? ||244|| Lanka has been made inaccessible by numerous devices that constantly destroy people, it is difficult even to look at it, and it is filled with extreme fear and depth. ||245|| Among all these, I do not see a single Vidyadhara who possesses great knowledge and is capable of going to Lanka and returning quickly. ||246|| Yes, the son of Pavananjay Raja, Shrishila, is endowed with knowledge, virtue, and prowess, and is extremely powerful. He should be requested. ||247|| He has an excellent relationship with Dasanan, so if he is sent, this excellent man can establish peace without any obstacles. ||248|| Then, all the Vidyadharas, with reverence, agreed to Mahodadhi's proposal and quickly sent a messenger named Shributi to Shrishila (Hanuman). ||249|| Gautama Swami says that even a king who possesses supreme power should acquire supreme wisdom regarding the work that is to be undertaken, for such a king, like the sun, attains his rise when the time comes. ||250||
Thus ends the forty-eighth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as Arsha, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, which describes the lifting of the Kotishila. ||48||

Then, saluting, the Marujjava, the messenger, arrived in the world. He entered the city of Sri, the abode of Lakshmi, filled with extremely high caves. ||1|| There, on the ground of the Hemaravana forest, he saw a palace shining with brilliance, adorned with balconies as bright as the Kunda flower, and glittering with gem-studded pinnacles. ||2|| It was filled with pearl garlands, adorned with windows, and surrounded by gardens. The Marujjava entered the house. ||3|| Seeing the extraordinary crowd and the wondrous, excessive traffic, his mind, with great difficulty, attained composure. ||4|| When the Marujjava, the messenger, entered the house, the daughter of Chandranakha, Anangakusuma, fainted. ||5|| Seeing her right eye twitching, she thought, "What is destined to happen by fate cannot be done otherwise." ||6|| Even the gods cannot do anything otherwise, let alone humans, who are bound by their limited power. ||7|| Then, the messenger, Sribhuta, whose body was covered with drops of sweat, was admitted to the assembly by the gatekeeper, who had been informed of his arrival by Anangakusuma's playful companion. ||8|| Then, with a humble face, he narrated the entire story as it was: Rama and others came to the Dandaka forest, Shambuka was killed, there was a fierce battle with Khara-Dushana, and Khara-Dushana was killed along with the best of men. ||9-10|| Hearing this news, Anangakusuma, with a body overwhelmed by grief, fainted, and her eyes closed. ||11|| Her movements ceased, and she was sprinkled with sandalwood oil. Seeing this, the entire inner palace, like an ocean, was filled with extreme agitation. ||12|| All the women of the inner palace began to weep together, and the sound of their weeping, along with the sound of thousands of veena strings being struck, arose. ||13||

Anangakusuma, with great difficulty, regained consciousness.  She, filled with sorrow, wept, her breasts soaked with tears. ||14||
"Oh, father, where have you gone? Speak to me. Oh, brother, what has happened? Show yourself to me, even once." ||15||
"Oh, father, you have gone to a terrible forest, facing battle. How did you meet your death, by the hands of the earth-dwellers?" ||16||
When the abode of Shrishila was filled with grieving people, Anangakusuma, with her friend Narmada, took the messenger to a suitable place to speak. ||17||
Anangakusuma, the daughter of Chandranakha, was consumed with grief for her father and brother. She was comforted by virtuous men, skilled in pacifying sorrow, with great difficulty. ||18||
Anangakusuma, well-versed in the Jain path, knowing the nature of the world, performed the post-death rituals for her father, in accordance with the customs of the people. ||19||
The next day, Shrishila Hanuman, filled with grief, surrounded by his ministers and other learned men, called the messenger and asked, "Messenger, tell me everything about the death of Kharadushana." Saying this, Hanuman remembered Kharadushana. ||20-21||
Then, Hanuman, whose entire body was filled with anger, his eyebrows, like a streak of lightning, flickered. ||22||
Then, the messenger, filled with fear, his body trembling, spoke to Hanuman, a wise and powerful man, in sweet words, to pacify his anger. ||23||
"Oh, Lord, you know that the king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, was afflicted by a woman-related sorrow, caused by the Vidyaadhara, Sahasagati, who had assumed his form." ||24||
Sugriva, filled with sorrow, sought refuge in Rama, who promised to alleviate his suffering and went to Kishkindha. ||25||
There, a great battle took place between your father-in-law, Sugriva, and the imposter, Sahasagati, who had stolen his form, a battle that exhausted even the greatest warriors. ||26||
Then, Rama, with his great power, rose and challenged him. Seeing Rama, the Vetala Vidya, the cause of the theft, was destroyed. ||27||
Then, Sahasagati, regaining his true form, was recognized by those who had been freed by Rama and was taken to death by the Shilimukhas. ||28||
The sound of weeping arose, as if thousands of strings of a Veena were struck together, producing a single sound. ||13||

## The Fifty-First Chapter

Hearing this, the son of the wind, Pavana-nandana, became free of anger. His lotus-like face blossomed, and he spoke, pleased: "Well done, well done, O Rama! This is most pleasing to us. You have swiftly rescued the lineage of Sugriva, which was drowning in infamy."

"The lineage of Sugriva, like a golden pot, was sinking into the abyss of disgrace. But Rama, the possessor of excellent wisdom, rescued it with the rope of his virtues."

Thus, praising Rama and Lakshmana profusely, Hanuman became immersed in the ocean of supreme joy.

Hearing of the cessation of his father's grief, Padma-raga, the daughter of Sugriva and Hanuman's second wife, was overjoyed. She celebrated with great festivities, including donations and offerings.

Hanuman's abode was filled with both sorrow and joy, devoid of radiance and yet resplendent. He was imbued with two emotions, due to his two wives.

With his family in such a state of turmoil, the purifier, the victorious one, sought to bring some balance and set out towards Kishkindha.

As he journeyed, his immense army, with its boundless splendor, made the world seem as if it had been reborn, devoid of the sky.

His magnificent chariot, adorned with jewels and gems, eclipsed the sun's radiance with its own brilliance.

Behind this fortunate one, hundreds of friendly kings followed, like the best of the gods following Indra.

The celestial beings accompanying him, with their cries of victory, filled the sky with sound.

The sight of his horses traversing the sky was wondrous, and the elephants displayed their captivating grace, in keeping with their nature.

With chariots drawn by magnificent steeds, adorned with fluttering flags, the sky seemed to be filled with a forest of celestial trees.

The vast expanse of white umbrellas created the illusion that the sky was entirely covered with clusters of white lotuses.

The deep-toned, valiant, resonant drum, silencing all other sounds, stood, its echoes filling the directions. ||43||
The sky-court was filled with his moving army, appearing as if covered in fragments. ||44||
The sky, adorned with the many-hued jewels of his ornaments, seemed like a cloth dyed by a skilled artisan. ||45||
The monkeys, hearing the deep sound of Hanuman's conch, were filled with joy, like peacocks at the sound of thunder. ||46||
The city of Kishkindha was adorned with great splendor, decorated with flags and garlands, and adorned with jeweled arches. ||47||
Hanuman, worshipped by many celestial beings, entered the grand palace of Sugriva. ||48||
Sugriva, with due respect, honored him and recounted the deeds of Rama and others. ||49||
United with Hanuman, Sugriva and the other kings, filled with great joy, approached Rama. ||50||
Then Hanuman saw Rama, the best of men, the elder brother of Lakshmana, with black, curly, fine, and very smooth hair. ||51||
His body was embraced by a creeper of Lakshmi, he appeared like a young sun, or like the moon adorned with the radiance of the lotus. ||52||
He was a delight to the eyes, a master of captivating the mind, a creator of unprecedented deeds, and seemed to have come from heaven. ||53||
His radiance was like the inner part of a glowing, pure, golden lotus, his nose was graceful, and his ears were well-formed and pleasing to the virtuous. ||54||
He appeared like the embodied god of love, his eyes were like lotuses, his eyebrows were arched like a drawn bow, and his face was like the full moon of the autumn season. ||55||
His lips were like a ruby, his teeth were white as jasmine, his neck was like a conch, his chest was like that of a lion, and his arms were long. ||56|| 

Page #321:

The one whose row of teeth was as white as the Kunda flower, whose throat was like a conch shell, who had a broad chest like a lion, and who was endowed with great arms. ||56|| Whose middle breast bore the mark of Srivatsa, full of brilliance and great beauty, who had a deep navel and was adorned with a slender waist. ||57|| Who was full of peaceful qualities, adorned with various auspicious marks, whose hands were very delicate, and whose thighs were round and thick. ||58|| Whose feet were like the back of a tortoise, full of great brilliance and delicate, who was radiant with a row of nails that looked red like the shoots of the moon. ||59|| Who was deep in unshakeable fortitude, whose body was like a mass of vajra, or as if created by bringing together all beautiful things. ||60|| Who was endowed with great influence, whose circle was like that of a Nyagrodha (banyan) tree, who was distressed like a young lion due to separation from his beloved. ||61|| Who seemed like Indra without Indrani, or like the moon without Rohini, who was endowed with both beauty and good fortune, and was proficient in all scriptures. ||62|| Who was endowed with the greatness of heroism and with qualities like intelligence. Seeing such Sri Rama, Maruti (Hanuman) was filled with awe. ||63|| 

Then, overwhelmed by Rama's influence, Hanuman, whose body was embraced by a cluster of radiance, began to think in confusion. ||64|| That this is the same Lakshmiman (wealthy) King Ramachandra, the son of Dasharatha, whose brother, the best of men, Lakshmana, is obedient. ||65|| Seeing his umbrella, like the moon, in the battle, the Vaitali Vidya, the power of courage, left him. ||66|| My heart, which did not tremble even when I saw Indra, is now filled with utmost awe at the sight of him. ||67|| Thus, filled with wonder, Hanuman followed his qualities and reached the lotus-eyed Rama. ||68|| Rama, whose mind was filled with joy, seeing him from afar, got up and embraced him in order. ||69|| Looking at each other and conversing in a manner befitting humility, they settled down on their respective seats adorned with various decorations. ||70||

There, seated on a beautiful, auspicious seat, was the son of Kakutstha, adorned with armlets, resplendent with Lakshmi all around. ||71|| He, clad in a pure blue garment, shone like a jewel in a crown. He, adorned with a boar's tusk, shone like the rising moon. ||72|| Clad in a divine yellow garment, adorned with garlands, armlets, and earrings, Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, shone like a cloud with lightning. ||73|| Sugriva, the king, with a crown adorned with the mark of a monkey, and with the prowess of an elephant of the gods, shone like a powerful guardian of the world. ||74|| Viradha, the prince, seated behind Sumitra, was invisible due to his brilliance, like a jewel in a chakra. ||75|| Hanuman, the wise, also shone near Padma-nama, like the brilliant planet Mercury rising near the full moon. ||76|| Adorned with fragrant garlands, clothes, and other ornaments, Angada and Angada shone like Yama and Vaishravana. ||77|| Nala, Nila, and hundreds of other kings, seated around Raghunandan, were also shining brightly. ||78|| The air was fragrant with the scent of five kinds of fragrant tambula and other fragrant substances. The assembly, illuminated by ornaments, was like the assembly of Indra. ||79|| Filled with wonder, Hanuman, full of joy, said to Rama, "O Raghunandan, although your qualities should not be praised in your presence, because such a custom is seen even in this world, still, the intense desire to praise your qualities directly is justified. Because, for those who are dear speakers, the direct praise of qualities is a source of great joy. ||80-82|| I have heard of your extraordinary greatness, which is stronger than the world. I see you, the protector of beings, with my own eyes, and you are indeed powerful. ||83|| O King, you are endowed with all beauty, and your world is adorned with your bright fame, which is like a treasure of qualities. ||83||
They all sat on their respective seats, adorned. ||70||

**84.**  We have heard of your valor at Sita's Swayamvara, when you obtained the bow and were protected by a thousand warriors.

**85.**  You are the Lord of the Universe, Rama, whose father is Dasharatha, whose friend is the entire universe, and whose brother is Lakshmana.

**86.**  Oh, what power, what form!  Even Narayana himself is devoted to obeying your commands, the master of the ocean-bending bow.

**87.**  Oh, what patience, what sacrifice!  You entered the Dandaka forest, fulfilling your father's word, even though it brought great fear.

**88.**  Even a brother or a satisfied Indra could not do what you have done for us, oh Lord.  How can we ever repay your kindness?

**89.**  You have removed the stain from the lineage of the monkey banner by slaying the courageous, deceitful, and powerful Sugriva in his own form.

**90.**  We, with our knowledge, strength, and understanding of the law, could not even bear the sight of his magical form, let alone defeat him.

**91.**  That Sugriva, in his own form, tried to seize the army of monkeys, but his form vanished at the mere sight of you.

**92.**  How can one not be pure in heart towards someone who is incapable of repaying a great kindness?  Such purity of heart is easily attainable.

**93.**  How can one have even a moment of justice in their mind if they do not recognize the greatness of a kindness done to them?

**94.**  He who is ungrateful is more wicked than a dog-eater, more cruel than a greedy man, and unworthy of association with the virtuous.

**95.**  We are all devoted to you, Lord, and will even give up our own bodies to serve you.

**96.**  I will go and awaken the wise king of the three peaks.  I will bring your wife back to you quickly, oh mighty-armed one.

**97.**  Oh Raghava, you will soon see Sita's lotus-like face, radiant like the rising moon, freed from doubt.

**83.**  Just as precious stones are found in mines or oceans, so too are virtues found in you.  The world is adorned by your pure fame.

Then the minister Jambunada spoke to Hanuman, words of great benefit: "My dear son, son of the wind, you alone are our refuge." (98) "You must go to Lanka, guarded by Ravana, with utmost care. Do not engage in any conflict with anyone, at any time." (99) Saying "So be it," the noble Hanuman prepared to depart. Seeing him, Rama was filled with immense joy. (100) Calling Hanuman, adorned with beautiful features, again and again, Rama, with eyes like blooming lotuses, spoke with utmost respect: "Tell Sita from me, O virtuous one, that Rama, due to his separation from you, finds no peace of mind anywhere. His mind finds no solace in anything." (101-102) "I consider it a great blow to my manhood that you, in my presence, are facing resistance and obstruction." (103) "I know you are pure in character and devoted to me. Though you may wish to give up your life, grieving over our separation, O beautiful one, even so, death with a bad outcome is futile. O daughter of Mithila, hold onto your life. You should not abandon it." (104-105) "It is rare to find a reunion, even more so, it is rare to find a reunion that is cherished above all else. Even rarer than that is the Dharma revealed by the mouth of the Jina." (106) "Even though that Dharma is rare, death in Samadhi is rarer still. Without that, this life is seen as empty, like husks." (107) "And to give my beloved assurance of my life, give her this excellent ring, always cherished by me." (108) "And, O son of the wind, go quickly and bring me Sita's radiant, magnificent crown, which will also give me assurance." (109) Saying "As you command," Hanuman, adorned with a crown of jewels, bowed to Rama and Lakshmana, and went out. He was filled with joy, radiant with divine powers, and his brilliance filled the entire courtyard of Sugriva's palace. (110) 

You will soon see Sita's face, as pure and bright as the moon. (97)

**307**

**Verse 112:**  "Until my return, you must remain here, O Sugriva, with vigilance and without any carelessness."

**Verse 113:**  "Hanuman, mounted on a beautiful, peaked chariot, shone brightly, like a radiant shrine on the summit of Mount Meru."

**Verse 114:**  "He departed with utmost speed, adorned with a white canopy, and attended by waving chowries resembling flying swans."

**Verse 115:**  "Surrounded by armies resembling those of the gods, with horses swift as the wind, and elephants like moving mountains, he proceeded."

**Verse 116:**  "Thus, endowed with great power, and watched over by Rama and the others, he went forward, continuously traversing the path of the sun."

**Verse 117:**  "The world is full of creatures of various kinds, enjoying excellent pleasures. But only a few among them engage in the pursuit of the ultimate truth, and attain supreme glory."

**Verse 118:**  "Noble humans always remember the kindness shown to them by others. In this world, there is no moon, no Kubera, no sun, nor Indra, who can equal them."

**Thus ends the forty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Departure of Hanuman," narrated by the sage Ravisha.**

**Notes:**

1. **Damsa:**  A type of chariot.

## The Fiftieth Chapter

And thus, the one who was destined for the highest good, Hanuman, went through the sky, shining like the sun, as if he were going to bring back his sister Sita. ||1||

The noble Hanuman, who was engaged in the command of his friend Rama, was filled with a great joy in his heart, being humble, generous, and pure. ||2||

As Hanuman stood in the path of the sun, looking at the sky with his keen vision, the sky seemed to him like the limbs of his own body. ||3||

As Hanuman was eager to go to Lanka, he saw the city of King Maheendra, which seemed like the city of Indra. ||4||

That city was situated on the peak of a mountain, and it was illuminated from afar by its white buildings, which were like white lotuses on a platform, and shone like the moon. ||5||

Just as Indra had no affection for the city of Bali, so Hanuman had no affection for that city of King Maheendra. He thought to himself, ||6||

"This city of King Maheendra is situated on the peak of this mountain, where that wicked king Maheendra resides. ||7||

My mother, who was filled with sorrow during my gestation, came to this city, but this wicked man expelled her. ||8||

Then my mother stayed in that cave in the desolate forest, where the sage Amitagati, who was engaged in the practice of yoga, resided. In that cave, that merciful sage comforted her with kind words, and she gave birth to me, being alone and deprived of her relatives. ||9-10||

In this same cave, my mother suffered from the lion, and in this same cave, she received the presence of the sage. Therefore, this cave is very dear to me. ||11||

Now, I will serve King Maheendra by giving him the punishment he deserves for expelling my mother, who had sought refuge with him. ||12||

This Maheendra is very arrogant and constantly hates me. Therefore, I will surely remove his pride." ||13||

Then, from the multitude of towering clouds, there arose the thunderous roar of drums, the mighty sound of trumpets, and the clash of cymbals. ||14|| The conch shells were blown, shaking the earth, by warriors with fierce determination, their weapons gleaming brightly, their spirits soaring. ||15|| Hearing the approach of the enemy, King Mahendra, with his entire army, marched forth, like an unyielding mountain against a storm cloud. ||16|| Seeing his forces faltering under the onslaught, the prince, Mahendra, mounted his chariot, his umbrella held high, and drew his bow. ||17|| Hanuman, the yogi, with three arrows, pierced the prince's long bow, as a yogi pierces the veil of illusion with three yogic practices. ||18|| As the prince, with a troubled mind, reached for another bow, Hanuman released a volley of arrows, scattering his swift steeds. ||19|| The horses, freed from the chariot, galloped wildly, like the senses of a man lost in worldly desires, freed from the control of the mind. ||20|| The prince, in panic, sought refuge in a magnificent aerial chariot, but even that was shattered by Hanuman's arrows, like the shattered beliefs of a fool. ||21|| Filled with the power of his knowledge, the prince, Mahendra, once again, attacked with blazing arrows, discs, and golden weapons. ||22|| Hanuman, with his own knowledge, countered the onslaught, like a yogi who, through meditation, controls the forces of nature. ||23|| The prince, mercilessly unleashing his weapons, burning like a raging fire, was captured by Hanuman, like a serpent caught by Garuda. ||24|| Seeing his son captured, King Mahendra, his face flushed with rage, mounted his chariot and confronted Hanuman, like the false Sugriva, disguised as Sugriva, confronted Rama. ||25|| The king, whose chariot shone like the sun, adorned with a beautiful garland, a skilled archer, the leader of the valiant, approached his son, his heart ablaze with love. ||26||

In the Padma Purana, the two, like two wind-controlled clouds, clashed with each other, striking each other with their swords, axes, and arrows. ||27|| Like lions, they were both extremely angry and possessed great strength, their eyes red with blazing sparks, breathing like serpents. ||28|| They hurled insults at each other, their arrogant laughter echoing loudly. "Damn your courage! Are you really going to fight?" they said to each other. ||29|| They fought a fierce battle, both endowed with magical powers, their own men shouting "Ha!" and "Victory!" at times. ||30|| Then, Mahendra, the mighty, endowed with the power of transformation, his body glowing with anger, unleashed a barrage of weapons. ||31|| He hurled at Hanuman, Bhushundi, axes, arrows, the Shataghni, maces, clubs, mountain peaks, and trees like the Sal and the Banyan. ||32|| Hanuman, however, was not shaken by these and other various weapons, just as a mountain is not shaken by a group of large clouds. ||33|| The rain of weapons, created by Mahendra's divine magic, was pulverized by the son of the wind, Hanuman, through the power of his meteor-magic. ||34|| Leaping from his chariot, Hanuman, with his massive arms like the tusks of an elephant, stopped Mahendra's chariot and seized his grandfather. The heroes cheered, and Hanuman, carrying his grandfather, mounted his own chariot. ||35-36|| Mahendra, with a gentle voice, began to praise his grandson, who was capable of producing meteors from his transformed hands and who possessed the highest good. ||37|| "Oh, my son! Your great power, though I had heard of it before, I have now seen with my own eyes. ||38|| You, who were never defeated by anyone in the battle with Indra, the lord of the gods, on the top of the Vijayadhan mountain, where there was a multitude of weapons and magical powers." ||39||

The fiftieth chapter, this is the story of the greatness of the son, Prasannakoti, who is happy. You have defeated him and he has been captured, this is a great wonder. ||40|| Oh, Bhadra! Your valor is amazing, your patience is truly wonderful, oh, your form is unparalleled, and your prowess in battle is also amazing. ||41|| Oh, Vatsa! You were born from our good deeds, and you have illuminated our entire lineage. ||42|| You are endowed with virtues like humility, you are a reservoir of great brilliance, you are the embodiment of auspiciousness, and you have risen like a wish-fulfilling tree. ||43|| You are the teacher of the world, the refuge of your relatives, and a cloud of rain for all those who are scorched by the sun of sorrow. ||44|| Thus praising him, the grandfather, Mahendra, whose eyes were filled with tears of affection and whose hands were trembling, smelled his head and embraced him with joy. ||45|| The son of the wind, Hanuman, also bowed to the noble grandfather, folded his hands in respect, and with a subdued mind, he became as if transformed in an instant. ||46|| He said, "Oh, noble one! I have done some things to you in my childhood, oh, venerable one! You are worthy of forgiving all my faults." ||47|| He then recounted the entire story of his arrival, from the time he met Padma, to the time he arrived, with great respect. ||48|| He also said, "Oh, noble one! I am going to Trikuta for a very important reason. You go to Kishkindha and do the work of Dasharatha." ||49|| Saying this, the son of the wind flew up into the sky and went towards Trikuta with ease, like a god going to heaven. ||50|| The wise and affectionate king, Mahendraketu, went with his beloved son, Prasannakoti, and honored his daughter, Anjana. ||51|| Anjana, the beautiful one, having met her parents and seen her brother, attained supreme peace. ||52|| Hearing of Mahendra's arrival, Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, went to meet him, and Viradhit and others were filled with great joy. ||53||

Padmapurana
The past lives of the **Kritatma**, **Sucheta**, and those possessing **Uttama** beautiful radiance, are so unique that powerful men adorned with lofty pride become subservient to them. ||54|| Therefore, O **Bhavyajanas**! Guard your minds from all sides and constantly strive for that auspicious work, by attaining the abundant fruits of which you may achieve radiance like the sun. ||55||
Thus ends the fiftieth chapter of the **Padmapurana**, known as **Arsha**, narrated by **Ravishena Acharya**, describing the union of **Mahendra** with his daughter. ||50||

## The Fifty-First Chapter

A  **Dhadhimukha** island, adorned with excellent qualities, lay in the midst of the sky, where the **Sri-Saila** was flying high on its celestial chariot.  ||1||

In that **Dhadhimukha** island, there was a city of the same name, adorned with white palaces like curds, and beautiful golden arches. ||2||

Its regions were adorned with gardens, dark like new clouds, radiant with flowers, and resembling the sky with its stars. ||3||

There were ponds, clear as crystal, adorned with steps, and covered with lotuses, lilies, and other flowers, shining here and there. ||4||

In that land, far from the city, there was a terrible forest, filled with tall grasses, creepers, vines, trees, and thorns. ||5||

That forest was surrounded by dry trees, echoing with the roars of ferocious wild animals, terrifying, extremely harsh, agitated by strong winds, filled with fallen trees, generating great fear, containing very salty lakes, and frequented by crows, vultures, and other birds, devoid of human beings. ||6-7||

**Gautama Swami** said, "O King! In that desolate forest, two **Sadhus** (holy men), endowed with **Riddhi** (divine powers), were seated, practicing intense **Yoga** for eight days, with their arms hanging down." ||8||

At a distance of four **Kroshas** (a measure of distance) from those **Sadhus**, there were three beautiful maidens, with captivating eyes, clad in white garments, wearing matted hair, pure of heart, resembling the beauty of the three worlds, and adorned with new ornaments, performing severe austerities according to the rules. ||9-10||

Then, **Hanuman** saw those two **Sadhus** being consumed by a great fire, standing still like a pair of trees. ||11||

Those three maidens, whose vows were not yet completed, and who were full of beauty, were also touched by the rising smoke, as they were leaving. ||12||

Then, those two **Yogis**, united in their **Yoga**, with a longing for **Shiva**, stood firm, abandoning all attachments, and discarding their silken garments and ornaments. ||13||

In the *Papouraana*, the two *Sadhus* with long arms and peaceful faces, whose vision extended to the end of the *yuga*, were engaged in *pratima* meditation. ||14|| They were free from the desire for life and death, pure, peaceful, and indifferent to pleasure and pain, and equal to stone and gold. ||15|| Seeing them overwhelmed by a great fire, the king *Hanuman*, eager to show his affection, ||16|| quickly drew up the ocean water in his hand like a cloud and poured it down from the sky with great devotion. ||17|| The fire was extinguished by the water, just as great anger is calmed by the patience of a wise person. ||18|| While *Hanuman*, filled with devotion, worshipped the two *Sadhus* with flowers and other offerings, ||19|| three beautiful maidens, whose desires had been fulfilled, arrived after circumambulating Mount Meru. ||20|| They bowed respectfully to the two *Sadhus* and *Hanuman*, who were absorbed in meditation, and praised *Hanuman* saying, "Oh, your devotion to the *Jineshwara* is great, for you have quickly come from afar and protected us by taking refuge in the *Sadhus*." ||21-22|| "This great calamity arose because of us, but the *Sadhus* have not suffered even a little. Oh, how fortunate we are!" ||23|| Then *Hanuman*, with a pure heart, asked them, "Who are you, in this desolate and terrifying forest?" ||24|| The eldest of the maidens replied, "We are the three daughters of the *Gandharva* king *Dadhimukha* and his queen *Amara*." ||25|| "The first is *Chandralekha*, the second *Vidhyutprabha*, and the third *Tarangamala*. We are all..." ||26||
*Hanuman* felt great affection for all of them. Then, those who were engaged in *yoga*, i.e., meditation, who desired liberation, who had renounced the desire for attachments like *raga*, who had discarded clothes and ornaments, who kept their arms hanging down, whose faces were peaceful, whose vision extended to the end of the *yuga*, who were engaged in *pratima* meditation, who were free from the desire for life and death, who were pure, peaceful, and indifferent to pleasure and pain, and equal to stone and gold, those two *munis* were overwhelmed by a great fire. Seeing this, *Hanuman*, eager to show his affection, O king! ||13-16||
Filled with devotion, *Hanuman* quickly drew up the ocean water in his hand like a cloud and poured it down from the sky with great devotion. ||17|| The fire was extinguished by the water, just as great anger is calmed by the patience of a wise person. ||18|| While *Hanuman*, filled with devotion, worshipped the two *munis* with flowers and other offerings, until their desires were fulfilled, those three beautiful maidens arrived after circumambulating Mount Meru. ||19-20||
They bowed respectfully to the two *munis* and *Hanuman*, who were absorbed in meditation, and praised *Hanuman* saying, "Oh, your devotion to the *Jineshwara* is great, for you have quickly come from afar and protected us by taking refuge in the *Sadhus*." ||21-22|| "This great calamity arose because of us, but the *Sadhus* have not suffered even a little. Oh, how fortunate we are!" ||23||
Then *Hanuman*, with a pure heart, asked them, "Who are you, in this desolate and terrifying forest?" ||24|| The eldest of the maidens replied, "We are the three daughters of the *Gandharva* king *Dadhimukha* and his queen *Amara*." ||25|| "The first is *Chandralekha*, the second *Vidhyutprabha*, and the third *Tarangamala*. We are all..." ||26||

All the Vidyadhara Kumaras, who are like the sun in their families, who are born in places like Vijayadhara, are very eager for us and are not finding any happiness anywhere. Among those Kumaras, the wicked Angarak Kumar is especially bearing the heat. ||27-28||

One day, our father asked the Astanganimitta-knowing Muni, "O Bhagavan! Where will my daughters go?" ||29||

In reply, the Muni said, "Whoever will kill Sahasagati in battle, he will be their husband in a few days." ||30||

After hearing that word of the Muni, who is the holder of Amogh Vachan, our father, with a smile on his face, started thinking, ||31||

"Who will be that man in the world, like a Vajrayudha, who will kill Sahasagati, the best of the Vijayadhara mountain's northern range?" ||32||

Or, perhaps, the Muni's words never become false. Thinking this, our father, mother, and everyone else were filled with wonder. ||33||

Even after pleading for a long time, when Angarak could not get us, he became immersed in the worry of the reasons for giving us pain. ||34||

From that time onwards, our only desire has been, "When will we see that hero who will destroy Sahasagati?" ||35||

We three daughters came to this forest, full of harsh trees, to perfect the excellent Vidya called Manonugamini. ||36||

It has been twelve days since we have been here, and today is the eighth day since these two Munis arrived. ||37||

After that, that wicked Angaraketu saw us here, and due to the aforementioned karma, he became filled with anger. ||38||

Then, to kill us, he instantly made the ten directions like a cage, with smoke and a rain of Angarak fire. ||39||

The Vidya that is achieved with great difficulty in more than six years, has been achieved today, due to the affliction. ||40||

O Mahabag! If you were not here at this time of calamity, then surely we would all have been burnt in the forest along with the two Munis. ||41||

In the Padma Purana, after smiling and saying "Sadhu Sadhu" (well done, well done), Maruti (Hanuman) said, "The effort of the ladies is praiseworthy and surely fruitful." (42) "Oh, your intellect is pure, oh, your desires are placed in the right place. Oh, your noble nature is excellent, by which you have mastered knowledge." (43) Then, Hanuman narrated the entire account, from the beginning of Rama's arrival to his own arrival, in detail and in order. (44) Having heard the news, the great Gandharva king, along with his queen Amara and his followers, arrived there. (45) Thus, in an instant, the entire forest became like Nandanavana, due to the arrival of the Vidyadharas, similar to the arrival of the gods. (46) Then, the Gandharva king, taking his daughters with him, went to Kishkindha with great splendor and, staying under Rama's command, found joy. (47) He presented the three excellent daughters, who were the bearers of boundless good fortune and endowed with supreme glory, to Rama, the one who was engaged in peaceful deeds. (48) Although Rama was served by these daughters and other glories, he did not see Janaki and considered the ten directions to be empty. (49)
Gautama Swami says, even though the entire earth is adorned with people who are endowed with virtues, possess good deeds, and are extremely beautiful, without the human being who dwells in the mind, it becomes like a dense forest. (50) Due to the intense karma obtained from past deeds and intense bondage, this being attains supreme joy, and due to that joy, this entire world remains under its control and shines with the sun of karma. (51) Thus ends the fifty-first chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravisha, which describes Rama's obtaining of the Gandharva daughters. (51)

## The Fifty-Second Chapter

The valiant son of the wind, Hanuman, approached the Trikuta mountain, just as the moon approaches Mount Mandara. || 1 ||

As he moved through the sky, his army suddenly stopped, resembling a giant bow, or a mass of dark, swirling clouds. || 2 ||

Hanuman asked, "Who has stopped the progress of my army? Quickly, tell me who is responsible for this." || 3 ||

"Is this the abode of the Asura king, or Indra, or Shikhandi? None of them seem fitting here." || 4 ||

"Perhaps there is a statue of the Jina on the peak of this mountain, or maybe a powerful, disembodied Muni is residing here." || 5 ||

Hearing Hanuman's speculative words, the minister Prithumati spoke, "O great-minded one, why do you linger here? This seems to be a treacherous, magical fortress, filled with cruel devices." || 6-7 ||

Hanuman, with his lotus-like eyes, looked closely and saw the formidable, magical fortress. It was impenetrable, like the mind of a detached woman. || 8 ||

It had many mouths, terrifying eyes, and was capable of devouring everything. It was radiant and inaccessible even to the gods. || 9 ||

The fortress was surrounded by rows of sharp, menacing spikes, and its edges were adorned with thousands of tongues that spewed blood. || 10 ||

It was filled with the hissing of countless, swaying serpent hoods, and the air was thick with poisonous smoke and burning embers, making it unbearable. || 11 ||

Any foolish man who approaches this fortress, driven by pride and courage, will never return, just like a frog that enters the mouth of a snake. || 12 ||

This fortress is like a celestial palace, towering above the path of the sun. It is difficult to cross, difficult to see, and well-guarded on all sides. || 13 ||

It is as terrifying as the roar of a storm at the end of an epoch, and as dreadful as a book of violence, born from the most wicked deeds. || 14 || 

Page #336:
---------------------------
318
Seeing this, Maruti, the protector of the Rakshasas, thought, "Oh, the one who created this illusory fortress has abandoned his former kindness." (15)
I will uproot this machine, which is strong due to its knowledge-power, and I will uproot its pride, just as a meditative person uproots delusion. (16)
Then, the wise Hanuman, focusing his mind on the battle, raised his own army, which roared like the ocean, in the sky. (17)
He then donned a knowledge-armor and, holding a mace, entered the puppet's mouth, just as the sun enters the mouth of Rahu. (18)
Then, with his sharp knowledge-nails, he tore open the puppet's belly, which was covered with bones, like a lion. (19)
And with merciless blows of his mace, he shattered it, making a terrible noise, just as a meditative person shatters the state of harmful actions with his pure thoughts. (20)
Then, the knowledge of the puppet, having been broken, made a terrifying sound, like the roar of dark clouds. (21)
Because of this, the puppet, which was extremely fickle, was destroyed, just as the accumulation of karmic impurities is destroyed by the praise of the Jina. (22)
Hearing this sound, which was as loud as the clouds at the end of the world, and seeing the illusory fortress being destroyed, the king Vajramukha, who was in charge of protecting the fortress, became angry and quickly mounted his chariot and went towards Hanuman, like a lion towards a fire. (23-24)
Seeing Hanuman in front of him, the fierce warriors, equipped with various vehicles and weapons, prepared to fight. (25)
Seeing the powerful army of Vajramukha ready for battle, Hanuman's army, filled with extreme anxiety, also rose to fight. (26)
What more need be said? The battle began, just as it had before, with the insult of the king and the disrespect of the king. (27)
The fortress of Lanka is as high as the path of the sun, difficult to obtain, difficult to see, spread in all directions, terrifying with its sharp roar like the roar of a cloud at the end of the world, and extremely sinful, created by people who are like weapons of violence. (13-14)
Seeing this, Hanuman thought, "Oh, the one who created this illusory fortress has abandoned his former kindness." (15)
I will uproot this machine, which is strong due to its knowledge-power, and I will uproot its pride, just as a meditative person uproots delusion. (16)
Then, the wise Hanuman, focusing his mind on the battle, raised his own army, which roared like the ocean, in the sky. (17)
He then donned a knowledge-armor and, holding a mace, entered the puppet's mouth, just as the sun enters the mouth of Rahu. (18)
Then, with his sharp knowledge-nails, he tore open the puppet's belly, which was covered with bones, like a lion. (19)

Then, the knowledge of the puppet, having been broken, made a terrifying sound, like the roar of dark clouds. (21)
Because of this, the puppet, which was extremely fickle, was destroyed, just as the accumulation of karmic impurities is destroyed by the praise of the Jina. (22)
Hearing this sound, which was as loud as the clouds at the end of the world, and seeing the illusory fortress being destroyed, the king Vajramukha, who was in charge of protecting the fortress, became angry and quickly mounted his chariot and went towards Hanuman, like a lion towards a fire. (23-24)
Seeing Hanuman in front of him, the fierce warriors, equipped with various vehicles and weapons, prepared to fight. (25)
Seeing the powerful army of Vajramukha ready for battle, Hanuman's army, filled with extreme anxiety, also rose to fight. (26)

## Chapter Fifty-Two

**319** Those warriors who were in the line of sight of the Lord, i.e., those whom the Lord looked at, roared and gave up their attachment to life. What more can be said about them? **28** Then, those warriors who had fought great battles for a long time, the warriors of Vajrayudha, were defeated by the Vanaras in a moment and were scattered here and there. **29** And Hanuman, with his chakra, took away the strength of the enemies and, like a celestial body, cut off the head of the enemy and dropped it from the sky. **30** Seeing the death of her father in the battle, the daughter of Vajrayudha, the beautiful one of Lanka, suppressed her grief with difficulty, poisoned by the venom of anger, and ran towards Hanuman. At that time, she was riding a chariot drawn by swift horses, her face illuminated by the radiance of her earrings, her chest was as wide as a bow, her eyebrows were furrowed, she appeared as if a meteor had manifested, she was adorned with a halo of brilliance like the sun, she was accompanied by the emission of smoke, i.e., some smoke seemed to be coming out of her body, and she appeared as if she were in the midst of a cloud mass, her eyes, swollen due to anger, looked like red lotuses, she was biting her lips in anger, and she appeared as if she were the angry Lakshmi of Indra. **31-34** She was beautiful to behold and was praising herself. Thus, she ran, stringing an arrow on her bow, and said, "Oh, Shrishail! I have seen you. If you have any strength, stand your ground." **35** "Today, the enraged king of the Vidyadharas, Ravana, will do whatever he wants to you, you wretch! I will do the same to you." **36** "I will send you, this sinner, to the abode of Yama. You have come to this inauspicious place like a bewildered person." **37** As the swiftly approaching Lanka Sundari was about to lower her umbrella, Hanuman, with an arrow, broke her bow in two. **38** As Lanka Sundari was about to pick up her weapon called Shakti, Hanuman covered the sky with arrows and broke her Shakti in the middle. **39** Lanka Sundari, who was deep in her knowledge and strength, shot arrows like vajra dandas, axes, spears, chakra, and stones like a hundred-headed mace. **40** The wind-god's son's chariot was as high as the Himalayas, and the arrows pierced the clouds like the piercing of water by a thunderbolt. **41**

## English Translation:

**320**

In the Padma Purana, the great-souled Hanuman, covered by the multitude of weapons hurled with full force, resembled the sun obscured by clouds in the rainy season. (42) Undeterred, the valiant Hanuman, skilled in the art of illusion, repelled the enemy's weapons with his own. (43) Arrows were countered by arrows, tomars by tomars, and shaktis by shaktis, flying far like meteors. (44) The sky, filled with the expanse of chakras, krakacha, samvartaka, and kanaka, became terrifying, resembling a sky filled with lightning. (45)

The beautiful princess of Lanka, resembling Lakshmi with lotus eyes, a courageous woman by nature, O King, pierced Hanuman with the arrows of love, the arrows of knowledge and meditation, captivating, irresistible, imbued with virtues, and capable of penetrating the heart with their beauty. (46-47)

Hanuman was pierced by the arrows of love released from her eyes, and by other arrows shot from her bow, reaching his ears. (48)

The princess, blessed with auspicious qualities, capable of astonishing the world, entered the heart of the valiant Hanuman. (49)

Hanuman was not as affected by the arrows, shaktis, and shataghnis as he was by the arrows of love, which pierced his very core. (50)

Hanuman thought, "This beautiful woman, with her graceful arrows, is wounding me both internally and externally." (51)

"It is better to die in this battle, filled with arrows, than to live without her, even in heaven." (52)

As Hanuman pondered these thoughts, the princess of Trikuta, her heart filled with compassion, urged him on, her voice sweet and alluring. (53)

She addressed the valiant Hanuman, with lotus-like eyes, youthful moon-like face, adorned with a crown bearing the mark of a monkey, a young man resembling the god of love, beautiful and a delight to the wind, "Let your power rise, O valiant one!" (54)

The princess, with a voice like thunder, took up her chakra, shataghni, musala, and stones, showering them like the heavy clouds during a storm. (55)

**I**

She thought, "How can I kill him, even though he is guilty of killing my father? He has pierced my heart with his unparalleled beauty." || 56 || "If I don't enjoy the pleasures of love with him, then my birth in this world is futile." || 57 || 

Therefore, with a bewildered mind, she sent an arrow marked with her name to Hanuman, aiming for the right path. || 58 || She wrote on the arrow, "O Lord! I, who could not be conquered even by the assembled gods, have been defeated by your arrows of love." || 59 ||

**II**

Hanuman, having read the arrow, calmly descended from his chariot. || 60 || Approaching the princess, he embraced her tightly, like Kamadeva embracing Rati. || 61 ||

Then, with her anger subsided, her eyes shedding tears like a stormy day, and grieving for her father's departure, Hanuman said to her, || 62 || "Don't cry, O gentle-faced one! Don't grieve, O beautiful one! This is the way of the eternal Kshatriya Dharma." || 63 || "You know that those who are engaged in royal affairs, driven by their karma, kill even their fathers." || 64 || "Why do you cry in vain? Abandon this grief. My dear, in this whole world, everyone enjoys the fruits of their actions." || 65 || "To say that he was killed by this enemy is merely a deception. In reality, the time has come for him to die due to the influence of his past karma and lifespan." || 66 ||

With these and other words, her grief subsided, and she shone with Hanuman, like a moonless night adorned by the moon. || 67 || The fatigue of battle was dispelled for both of them by their embrace, filled with the torrent of love. || 68 ||

Padma Purana
The army was stationed in the region where the celestial beings were stopped by the Vidya, in an abode built there. ||69||
That camp of Hanuman, resembling the red clouds of the evening, was as beautiful as the city of the gods. ||70||
The great kings, mounted on elephants, horses, chariots and aerial vehicles, entered that city, adorned with a multitude of flags, after asking Hanuman. ||71||
They stayed there, filled with enthusiasm and joy, recounting various stories born from the battles of the heroes. ||72||
Seeing Hanuman, whose mind was eager to go, the Lanka Sundari, filled with love, asked him in private: ||73||
"O Lord! You have heard of the unbearable prowess of Ravana, and you yourself are full of various offenses. Why are you eager to go to Lanka? Tell me." ||74||
In reply, Hanuman told her the whole story, saying that doing a favor was approved by his relatives. ||75||
"O Bhadra! Ravana, the king of the demons, has abducted Sita. I must bring about her reunion with Rama." ||76||
Hearing this, the Lanka Sundari said, "The old friendship you had with Ravana is gone. Just as the flame of a lamp is extinguished when the wick is destroyed, so too has Ravana's friendship for you been destroyed by the loss of faith and affection." ||77||
"There was a time when you entered Lanka, adorned with the beauty of the roads and a line of flags, with great respect, just as a god enters heaven." ||78||
"But today, if you appear in Lanka as a criminal, Ravana, who holds a harsh rule, will surely be filled with anger." ||79||
"Therefore, you should meet him only when the time and place are perfectly auspicious, and when Ravana's heart is pure and free from anxiety." ||80||
In reply, Hanuman said, "Wise one! What you have said is true. But, O Sundari, I want to know." ||81||
"And I also want to see what kind of woman Sita is, renowned for her beauty, who has stirred the heart of Ravana, who is as steadfast as Mount Meru." ||82||

## Chapter Fifty-Two

Thus speaking, Marutputra, with his great strength, left his army behind and went towards Trikuta, having been released by the wise woman. || 83 ||

**Doddhakavrittam**

This is a great wonder in the world of humans, that a being, abandoning one taste, immediately attains another taste with a pure body. || 84 ||

This is the wondrous activity of karma in this world. Just as the movement of the sun is sometimes towards the south and sometimes towards the north, so too, this entire activity, connected to the body of beings, is sometimes of this taste and sometimes of that taste, according to the activity of karma. || 85 ||

Thus ends the fifty-second chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the sage Ravishena, describing Hanuman's attainment of the Lanka Sundari maiden. || 52 ||

## The Fifty-Third Chapter

The wind-god, endowed with power and prosperity, entered Lanka without fear, accompanied by a few followers. ||1|| He entered the abode of Vibhishana, where he was welcomed with due respect. ||2|| After staying for a while and exchanging pleasantries, the wind-god spoke these words: "Is it right for the ruler of three lands to steal another man's wife like a petty thief? ||3-4|| Just as a mountain is the source of rivers, a king is the source of righteousness. If the king himself indulges in unrighteousness, his subjects will also follow suit. ||5|| Such an act is condemned by all, and everyone will suffer as a result. We, in particular, will surely face hardship. ||6|| Therefore, for the welfare of all, tell Ravana to speak words that uphold justice. ||7|| Tell him, O Lord of the world, to refrain from actions that are condemned in both worlds and that destroy his reputation. ||8|| A pure and blameless character is desired not only in this world but also in the celestial realm, where even the gods offer their salutations. ||9|| I have repeatedly advised Kaikesinandan (Ravana), but he has not spoken to me with respect since then. ||10|| Nevertheless, I will go to the king tomorrow at your request, but I am sure he will abandon this stubbornness with great difficulty. ||11|| Although eleven days have passed since Sita was deprived of food and water, the king of Lanka shows no remorse. ||12|| Hearing these words, Hanuman, filled with compassion, set out to go to the Pramoda Garden. ||13|| He saw the garden, entangled with creepers, adorned with red leaves, and filled with beautiful flowers. ||14|| 

Page #343:
---------------------------
The chapter Tripañcāśattam is adorned with a garland of beautiful clusters of flowers, covered with bees, with branches bent down with the weight of fruits, slightly shaken by the wind. It is adorned with clear lakes covered with lotuses and other flowers, and it is resplendent with great trees intertwined with celestial creepers. It resembles the land of Devakuru, covered with pollen from flowers, full of wonders, and resembling Nandanavana. 

Then, carrying a beautiful playfulness, the lotus-eyed Hanuman entered the excellent garden, desiring to see Sita. 

Having arrived there, he quickly cast his gaze in all directions and in the dense groups of various trees with leaves, etc. Seeing Sita from afar, he was devoid of the sight of anything else, that is, he kept his eyes fixed on her. Then he thought, "This is the beautiful one of Ramadeva." 

She is like a soft flame, her eyes are filled with tears, she holds the moon-like face in her palm, her hair is loose, and her belly is very thin. 

Seeing her, Hanuman began to think, "Oh! Her form in the world defeats all beautiful things, has attained supreme fame, and is the cause of true things." 

Lakshmi, devoid of the lotus, that is, Lakshmi who emerged from the lotus, cannot equal her. Oh! Even though she is submerged in the ocean of sorrow, she is not like other women. 

She was thinking, "I can fall from the peak of this mountain and attain death, but I will not sustain life in the separation from Rama." 

Thinking thus, the son of the wind, with silent footsteps, attained a change of form, approaching Sita. 

Then Hanuman dropped a ring on the garment of her lap. Seeing it, she suddenly smiled and was filled with thrills. 

While Sita was in this state, the women who were there quickly went and told Ravana, who was eager to know Sita's news, the good news with joy. 

Page #344:
---------------------------
Padma Purana
Ravana, pleased, gave them clothes, jewels, and other things from his body. Hearing this, Sita, with a smiling face, thought, "The task is accomplished." ||28||  Filled with joy, as if he had received the nectar of immortality, he eagerly ordered a grand celebration. ||29||  Following her husband's command, the virtuous Mandodari, along with all the women of the palace, quickly went to where Sita was. ||30||  Seeing Sita, whose face was now radiant, Mandodari said after a long time, "Oh, daughter! You have bestowed a great favor upon us all today." ||31||  "Just as Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, serves Indra, the king of the gods, who is endowed with all riches, so too, you should now serve Ravana, the lord of the world, free from sorrow." ||32||  Angered by Mandodari's words, Sita replied, "Oh, Vidyaadhari! If Rama were to know of your words, your husband would surely be killed." ||33||  "News of my husband has arrived, and I am filled with joy and have attained supreme patience. That is why I have a smile on my face." ||34||  Hearing Sita's words, the women of the Rakshasa king said, "She is delirious due to hunger, and that is why she is laughing and talking like this." ||35||  Gautama Swami says, "Oh, Shrenik! After this, Sita, filled with wonder, spoke in a very high voice, full of eagerness, saying, "Who is this kind and loving friend of mine who has come near me, who has suffered hardship in this terrifying island in the middle of the ocean?" ||36-37||
Then, Hanuman, whose presence was requested and whose mind was filled with virtue, thought, ||38||  "A man who puts the work of others before his own, and then hides himself, is a coward and a low person." ||39||  "Those who support others in times of distress, those compassionate souls, have a pure birth." ||40||  "There is no loss of manhood in revealing oneself, but rather, by revealing oneself, the glorious Lakshmi gains prestige in the world." ||41||  Then, Hanuman, like a celestial being, went to Sita, who was sitting among thousands of beautiful women.

## The Tripañcāśattam Parva, Chapter 327

**42.**  He, who was fearless and valiant like an elephant, whose face was as beautiful as the full moon, who was radiant like a thousand suns, adorned with garlands and garments, incomparable in form, radiant like the moon devoid of blemishes, bearing the mark of a monkey on his crown, fragrant and attracting bees, whose entire body was anointed with sandalwood, adorned with yellow unguents, whose lips were red with the juice of betel, adorned with a long garment, whose cheeks were illuminated by the light of his dangling earrings, who possessed a magnificent physique, whose valor was boundless, adorned with the ornaments of virtue, and endowed with great prowess, approached Sita, gradually attaining supreme beauty.

**43-47.** Seeing Hanuman, whose face was radiant with beauty, adorned with the supreme Lakshmi, those lotus-eyed women became agitated.

**48.** Mandodari, whose heart trembled, looked at Hanuman near Sita with wonder.

**49.** Then, approaching Sita, the supremely courteous son of the wind, placing his hands in a gesture of respect on his head, humbly declared his lineage, clan, and parents. Then, reassured, he delivered the message of Padma-natha.

**50-51.** He said, "O virtuous lady! Immersed in the ocean of your separation, Rama, even in a celestial chariot adorned with heavenly splendor, does not find joy.

**52.** Abandoning all other duties, he mostly remains silent, meditating on you like a sage, with a single-pointed mind.

**53.** O pure one, O virtuous one! The music of excellent women, accompanied by flutes and lutes, never reaches his ears.

**54.** O mistress! He always speaks of you with joy to everyone, and he only lives for the desire to see you.

**55.** Hearing these words of Hanuman, which revealed the state of her husband's heart, Sita, with her lotus eyes blooming, attained supreme joy.

**56.** Then, overcome with sorrow, Sita, with tears filling her eyes, spoke to the humble Hanuman, who stood before her.

Padma Purana
O Kapidhwaja, I am immersed in this state and afflicted by misfortune. What can I give you, being satisfied? ||58||
The son of Vayu said, "O auspicious one, O fortunate one, by your sight alone, everything has become attainable for me in the world." ||59||
Then, Sita, whose lips were covered with large drops of tears like pearls, and who appeared to be afflicted with sorrow like Lakshmi, asked Kapilakshana, "O auspicious one, how did you cross this terrible, insurmountable, and vast ocean, which is agitated by the Makara-graha and other disturbances? What state or accomplishment have you attained, that you are bringing me this supreme comfort by coming here? ||60-62||
"O auspicious one, you are my dear brother, adorned with beauty, radiance, and form, surrounded by an ocean of brilliance, and endowed with Lakshmi and fame." ||63||
"Where did you see my beloved? O noble one, is my beloved, Lakshmana, truly alive somewhere, together with him?" ||64||
"Is it not that my younger brother was killed in battle by those terrible, wicked Vidyadharas, and that Rama, the lotus-eyed one, has also attained the same state due to grief?" ||65||
"Or, after giving you a message, has my beloved, afflicted by intense grief due to my separation, gone to another world in some forest?" ||66||
"Or, being adept at renouncing the world, has he, discarding all possessions, become a disciple of the path prescribed by the Jina, and is now engaged in penance somewhere?" ||67||
"Or, has this ring fallen from the finger of Sri Rama, whose entire body has become weak due to separation, and you have found it?" ||68||
"You were not previously acquainted with my lord, so how did you gain his friendship without any reason?" ||69||
"Even though you have brought this ring out of kindness, I am not able to reciprocate your favor, being satisfied." ||70||
"O brother, you will speak the truth, for the sake of your parents or for the sake of Sri Jinendradeva, who resides in your heart." ||71||
Thus questioned, Hanumana, who was endowed with concentration of mind, who wore a monkey-marked crown, and who had wide-open eyes, joined his hands in a lotus posture, placed them on his head, and said, ||72||
"1. My beloved, M.
2. Killed my younger brother, K., Kh.
3. You are seeing (?), M.

## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter
### 329

When Lakshmana had taken possession of the Suryahaasa sword, and when Chandranakha did not want Rama and Lakshmana, she enraged her husband Kharadushana, that is, she provoked him by opposing them. ||73||

Until the mighty lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, was called for help, Kharadushana quickly approached Rama to fight. ||74||

While Lakshmana fiercely fought Kharadushana, Ravana, with immense strength, arrived at that place. ||75||

Although Ravana was knowledgeable in the discernment of Dharma and Adharma, and a scholar of all scriptures, he was captivated by the sight of you, becoming subservient to his mind. ||76||

Then, Ravana, whose entire policy had become corrupt and whose consciousness had become devoid of essence, made a magical lion's roar to abduct you. ||77||

When Rama, hearing the lion's roar, went to Lakshmana, who was engaged in battle, this sinner had already taken you and brought you here. ||78||

Lakshmana, having quickly sent Rama back from the battlefield, returned to that place, but, O virtuous wife, he did not see you there. ||79||

Then, searching for you, he wandered in the forest for a long time and saw Jatayu, with weakened life and near death. ||80||

Then, giving him the teachings of the Jina Dharma, he sat in the forest, filled with sorrow, his mind fixed only on you. ||81||

Lakshmana, having killed Kharadushana, returned to Rama and brought the news of your abduction to your husband, who was adorned with a garland of jewels. ||82||

Meanwhile, a Vidyadhara named Saahasagati, disguised as Sugriva, was ready to kill Rama, but due to Rama's influence, he was devoid of his powers and was killed himself. ||83||

Thus, for the great favor Rama had done to our clan, purifying it, I have been sent by my teachers and elders to repay the debt. ||84||

I will gladly free you. Fighting is pointless, for wise men consider the accomplishment of their goals as the most desirable thing in the world. ||85||

This king of Lanka, Ravana, is compassionate, humble, possessed of the three goals of Dharma, Artha, and Kama, courageous, and extremely gentle at heart. ||86||

He is kind, free from cruelty, and a follower of truth. Therefore, he will surely heed my words and hand you over to me. ||87||

This one, whose fame is known throughout the world, is protected by his own good deeds. He is very afraid of public censure. ||8||
Then, Janaka's daughter, Sita, who was filled with joy, spoke these words to Hanuman, who was endowed with great qualities. ||89||
How many monkey-bannered warriors, equal to you in valor, patience, beauty, and humility, are there who are devoted to my beloved? ||90||
Then Mandodari said, "Those who are brave, endowed with virtue and fame, and who are passionate about their qualities, do not praise themselves, being noble." ||91||
"O Vaidehi! You do not know him, why do you ask? There is no other monkey-bannered warrior equal to him in this entire Bharat region." ||92||
"In the midst of a great battle, where there is a multitude of flying vehicles and a clash of bells, he is the supreme aid of Dasamukha (Ravana)." ||93||
"He is known as Hanuman, the excellent son of Anjana, who helped Dasanana (Ravana) in the great battle." ||94||
"When Dasamukha (Ravana) was in great distress, he single-handedly defeated the Vidhyadharas, whose very names caused mental anguish." ||95||
"He obtained Anangakusuma, the daughter of Chandranakha. People always desire to see him, who is so profound." ||96||
"He is the delight of this city, like the cool rays of the moon, and Lanka's lord considers him as his own brother." ||97||
"This Hanuman, known throughout the world, is endowed with excellent qualities. He has been appointed as a messenger by the earth-dwellers." ||98||
"Oh, what a strange and especially reprehensible thing! He has been made a servant by the earth-dwellers, like a common man." ||99||
Hearing these words, Hanuman, who was steadfast in his mind, said, "Oh, this act of yours is the height of foolishness." ||100||
"How can one who is living a comfortable life with wealth, due to someone's grace, not be given good advice if he desires to do something wrong?" ||101||
"If a friend who is eager to fulfill one's desires wants to eat food mixed with poison, why is he not stopped?" ||102||

## Chapter Thirty-Five

A grateful person should be happy. The life of one who does not understand his own benefit is like that of an animal. || 103 ||

O Mandodari! You are carrying a hollow pride in vain, being a queen but taking on the role of a messenger. || 104 ||

Where is your good fortune and elevated form now, that you have become a messenger for a man who is infatuated with another woman? || 105 ||

It seems you have become a very ordinary woman in matters of love. I do not consider you a queen anymore, O unfortunate one! You have become a cow. || 106 ||

Mandodari, whose mind was filled with anger, then said, "Oh! You are being arrogant and boastful despite being a criminal." || 107 ||

If Ravana knows that you have come to Sita as a messenger, your fate will be like no one else's. || 108 ||

Those who have forgotten their servitude to Dashanan (Ravana) and are of small intellect, have gathered together, putting forward the one who killed Khara and Dushana by the grace of fate. What can these lowly ones, urged by Yama, do? || 109-110 ||

It seems that those whose souls are struck by extreme foolishness, who are shameless, possessors of low character, ungrateful, and are blooming in vain pride, have all come close to death. || 111 ||

Hearing Mandodari speak thus, Sita, filled with anger, said, "O Mandodari! You are a fool to praise yourself in this way." || 112 ||

Have you not heard of my husband Rama, whose name is praised in gatherings of heroes and scholars, and who possesses extraordinary prowess? || 113 ||

At the beginning of battle, the sound of his Vajra-like bow makes even the most skilled warriors tremble with fear and sorrow. || 114 ||

His younger brother Lakshmana, whose body is the abode of Lakshmi, is capable of destroying the enemy forces simply by his glance. || 115 ||

What is the point of saying more? Our husband, accompanied by Lakshmana, is coming after crossing the vast ocean. || 116 ||

**Note:** The term "Vajra-like bow" is a poetic description of Rama's bow, comparing its power and sound to that of a thunderbolt. 

Page #350:

You will see your husband, the one who is the embodiment of the self, slain in battle by my lord, who is the embodiment of the most intense energy, in just a few days. ||117|| You, who have become favorable to a husband who delights in sin, will go to widowhood and will wail for a long time, bereft of your husband. ||118|| Thus, Mandodari, who was filled with extreme anger and whose lips trembled, was overcome with great distress. ||119|| Although Mandodari was one, she, along with her eighteen thousand co-wives, who were filled with confusion and whose bodies trembled with anger, were ready to kill Sita with their swift hands. At that time, she was severely insulting her with extremely cruel words. ||120-121|| At that time, Hanuman, adorned with Lakshmi and full of speed, stood up and stood in the midst of them all, like a mountain standing in the midst of rivers. ||122|| Hanuman stopped all those women, who were the cause of sorrow and who were ready to kill Sita, just as a physician stops pain. ||123|| Then, all those women, who were wicked in intent, who had struck the earth with their feet, and who had abandoned the respect for adornment, went to Ravana. ||124|| Then, Hanuman, who was of good nature, bowed to Sita with great respect and requested her to eat with kind words. ||125|| Sita, whose vow had been fulfilled, whose desire was pure, and whose mind knew the time and place, agreed to take food. ||126|| While making the request, Hanuman explained, "O Devi! This earth, along with the ocean, is under the rule of Ramadeva, so this food here is not worthy of being abandoned." ||127|| Thus, being explained by him, Sita, the land of compassion, desired to eat food, and rightly so, because she was a virtuous woman, skilled in all conduct. ||128|| Then, Hanuman told Ira, the protector of the clan, "Bring the best and praiseworthy food quickly." ||129|| Upon being told this, the girl went to her camp, and when the night ended and the sun rose, Hanuman met with Vibhishana. ||130|| 1. गतासि म. । 2. स्पृशम् म. ।

The fifty-third chapter, the meal was enjoyed by the son of the wind, it was delightful. Thus, three Muhurtas passed in the performance of duty. ||531|| Then in the fourth Muhurta, Ira brought the meal fit for Sita. ||132|| The ground was smeared with sandalwood etc., and was as clean as a mirror, it was adorned with flowers, and was as beautiful as a lotus leaf. ||133|| Fragrant, abundant, pure, and wholesome, drinks etc., were brought in large vessels made of gold etc. ||134|| Some vessels were filled with ghee soup etc., some were adorned with rice like the white of the Kund flower. ||135|| Some were filled with six-flavored dishes, some were attractive, some were liquid, and some were suitable for making balls. ||136|| Some were made with milk, some were very delicious, some were for eating after the meal. ||137|| Thus, Ira, accompanied by her attendants, brought the excellent meal. Sita, with great devotion, bowed to the Jina, and, with her brotherly affection for Hanuman, completed the vow she had taken, "I will not eat until I hear news of my husband." She considered the arrival of the guests, purified her body by bathing etc., and, with her heart filled with the charming Rama, the virtuous lady, praised by the virtuous, ate the meal at the auspicious time. It is good because it is illuminated by the rays of the sun, extremely pure, delightful, increases merit, is healthy, and is eaten during the day. ||138-141|| After the meal, when Sita had rested a little, Hanuman again requested her, "O Devi! O Pure One! O Adorned with Virtues! Get on my shoulder, I will carry you across the ocean in a moment." ||142-143|| See Rama, adorned with splendor, devoted to you, and let the beloved people experience the joy of your union. ||144||

Then, with folded hands, Janaka's daughter wept and, with respect and composure, spoke as follows: "It is not proper for me to go without the command of my Lord. In this state, what answer shall I give to him?  "145-146. "People will not believe in my purity without death. Therefore, only my Lord will know what is right for me now." 147. "Brother, until some trouble arises from Dashavaktra, do not delay here for a moment." 148. "With folded hands and head bowed, you should tell the Lord of Life, with these words, in my words: 'O God! In that forest, one day, while praising you, you, with great devotion, worshipped the sky-faring sages with me.' " 149-150. "Once, we were playing in a beautiful lake, filled with pure water and adorned with lotuses, when a terrible wild elephant came there. At that time, I called out to you, and you immediately emerged from the middle of the water." 151-152. "And, while playing beautifully, you freed that arrogant great elephant from all his pride." 153. "Once, in a forest as beautiful as Nandanavana, laden with fruits, I was trying to bend a branch of a tree, attracted by its new leaves. Then, flying, playful bees attacked me and made me anxious. At that time, you embraced me with your arms and saved me from my fear." 154-155. "Once, I was sitting with you on the bank of a lotus grove, when I saw the sun rising, the ornament of the eastern direction, and praised it. Then, you, having obtained some jealousy, playfully struck me with a small stalk of a blue lotus." 156-157. "Once, on the peak of Rati Mountain, I, adorned with great beauty, asked you, 'My dear, what are the names of these trees, full of flowers, vast, possessing smoothness, and skilled in stealing the mind?'" 158-159. 
1. Without. 2. Collected. 3. Arrogant. 4. Delighted.

Then, being asked thus, you, with a cheerful countenance, said, "O Devi! These are the Nandi trees." ||160||

Once, when we were staying on the banks of the Karna Kundala river, two sky-faring Munis came near us at midday. ||161||

Then, you and I, rising up, performed a great worship with great devotion for those Munis who had come for alms. ||162||

And, according to the prescribed rites, we gave them the best food. By the influence of that, five wonders arose there, very beautiful. ||163||

The Devas in the sky made this sweet sound: "Oh! The gift of a vessel is the gift, this is the greatest gift." ||164||

Devas, whose bodies were invisible, beat drums, and there was a shower of flowers on which bumblebees were humming. ||165||

A pleasant, cool, fragrant, and dustless gentle breeze blew, and a stream of jewels, gems, and gold filled that hermitage. ||166||

O brother! After this, show this excellent Chudamani to the Lord of life, for it was very dear to him, and it is the cause of firm faith. ||167||

I know, O Lord! that you are very gracious to me, but still, for the sake of reunion, I must protect my life with all my might. ||168||

This separation from you has happened due to my carelessness, but now, while you are striving, our reunion is certain. ||169||

Saying this, Sita wept. Then, comforting her with effort, and saying, "As you command," Hanuman went out from that place where Sita was. ||170||

At that time, Sita, whose body was becoming weak, put the ring on her finger, and thought that she had obtained the reunion with her husband, who gave joy to her mind. ||171||

Then, the women in that garden, whose eyes were like those of a frightened deer, seeing Hanuman, were filled with a gentle smile and wonder, and began to talk to each other, saying, "Oh! This excellent man has descended upon this mountain of flowers. Is he the embodied Kamadeva? Or has some Deva come to see the beauty of the mountain?" ||172-174||

Some of the women, filled with desire, placed garlands on their heads and played the veena with a sweet voice like that of a Kinnara. ||175|| Some, with moon-like faces, held mirrors in their left hands, wanting to see Hanuman's reflection, and became distraught. ||176|| Some women, recognizing him somewhat, thought, "How did Maruti come here, he who was not honored at the gate?" ||177|| Thus, the beautiful women in the garden, with their minds filled with confusion, saw Hanuman, adorned with garlands, necklaces, and fine clothes, shining like Agni Kumar, walking gracefully towards a certain place. ||178-179|| Hearing this, Ravana, whose mind was consumed by anger and who had lost all sense of affection, immediately commanded his valiant chief servants, "You have no need to deliberate. Whoever is leaving the flower garden is a traitor. Bring him to the end of his life quickly." ||180-181||
Then, the servants came and were filled with wonder, thinking, "Is this the king who conquered Indra, or is it the Sun, or the star Shravana?" ||182|| "Let's go and see," they said, and shouted to everyone, "O, all the guardians of the garden, listen! Why are you sitting so carefree? We heard talk outside the garden that a wicked Vidhyadhara has entered the garden with arrogance. What is this? Kill that wicked one quickly, or capture him!" ||183-185||
Hearing the words of Ravana's chief servants, the servants of the garden shouted, "Run! Who is he? He must be somewhere here. Who is he, whose son is he? Where is he?" ||186|| Among those servants, some were armed with bows, some carried spears, some wielded maces, some were equipped with swords, some held lances, and many others were gathered in groups, holding flags. Seeing all this, Hanuman's mind was somewhat confused, but he was as valiant as a lion. He illuminated the sky with the radiance of his jeweled monkey-like form. ||187-188||
Then, free from anxiety and with his long, flowing garment, he descended from the sky, unseen by the servants. ||189||

Then, seeing the lip of Hanuman, who was shining like the rising sun, due to his anger, the groups of servants scattered. ||19|| Then, the chief of the servants, who was cruel and famous among the servants, gathered the force of servants, running here and there. ||191|| Those servants, who were armed with weapons like mace, discus, sword, spear, axe, and bow, surrounded Hanuman from all sides, shouting. ||192|| They were so numerous that the sunlight was obscured. Then, they started throwing weapons like the wind of the month of Jyestha throws straw. ||193|| Even though the son of the wind, Hanuman, was unarmed, he uprooted and threw groups of tall trees and rocks. ||194|| Striking with the speed of his arms, which were beautiful like the body of the great serpent, he appeared like a towering cloud of the time of destruction. ||195|| Without any delay, he uprooted and threw large and tall trees like peepal, teak, banyan, nandi, champa, bakul, neem, ashoka, kadamba, nagakesar, koha, dhava, mango, milma, lodhra, date palm, and jackfruit. ||196-197||

That mighty one quickly shattered some, uprooted others, and crushed many servants with kicks and punches. ||198|| He made the army, which was as vast as the ocean, so terrified that it fled in all directions, seeking to save its life. ||199|| Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! What need does the king of the deer, who rules over the deer, have for other helpers? And what benefit do those who have abandoned their natural strength have from other helpers? What good can other helpers do to a powerless man?" ||20||

Then, Hanuman, who had descended from the Pushpagiri, blocked the direction, and...

In the Padma Purana, the houses adorned with assemblies, pools, aerial vehicles, and excellent gardens were reduced to mere earth by the blows of Hanuman. ||202|| The paths for foot travel, the forests, and the mansions were all destroyed, leaving behind wide roads resembling dry seas. ||203|| The rows of tall shops were broken and many servants were slain, making the royal road resemble the battlefield of a great war. ||204|| With falling toranas (gateways) and trembling banners, the sky seemed to be raining down thunderbolts due to a celestial calamity. ||205|| The dust, rising from the speed of his leaps, was multi-colored, resembling thousands of rainbows created in the sky. ||206|| As the earth was shattered by the blows of his feet, the houses, like mountains, seemed to be sinking into the netherworld, emitting a thunderous sound. ||207|| He struck some servants with his eyes, crushed some with his hands, beat some with his feet, killed some with his chest, destroyed some with his shoulders, and blew some away with the wind. ||208|| With thousands of servants falling as soon as they came, the wide road became filled with a heap of corpses. ||209|| The deep sound of the citizens' cries of "Ha! Ha! Hi!" echoed, while the breaking of the jeweled peaks produced a tinkling sound. ||210|| As Hanuman leaped upwards, the large banners were pulled along by his speed, making them seem like bells ringing in anger, following behind him. ||211|| The large elephants uprooted the pillars and wandered around, while the horses, flying through the air, became like leaves. ||212|| The pools burst from their foundations and flowed away, leaving behind only mud, and the entire Lanka became agitated, like a chariot on the move. ||213|| The lotus grove of Lanka, where the demon-like fish were slain, was disturbed by Sri Shalavarna, who...

## The Fifty-Third Chapter

**215.** Having quickly assembled his army along with the Meghavahana, Indrajit followed close behind Hanuman.

**216.** Hanuman was ready to fight him, but the army following behind the Meghavahana had already arrived.

**217.** A fierce battle ensued on the outskirts of Lanka between Hanuman and the Vidyadharas, similar to the battle between Lakshmana and Kharadushana.

**218.** Mounting a chariot drawn by four swift horses, Hanuman drew his bow and charged towards the Rakshasas.

**219.** After a long battle, Hanuman, bound by Indrajit's naga-pasha, was taken into the city, lost in thought.

**220.** He, who had previously been seen as a thunderbolt, was now observed with a sense of calm by the city dwellers.

**221.** He was then taken to Ravana's court, where Ravana listened to the accusations against him, as narrated by his wise men.

**222.** They informed Ravana that Hanuman, summoned as an envoy, had gone to Kishkindha from his own city. On his way back to Lanka, he had destroyed the city of King Mahendra and brought it under the control of the enemy.

**223.** He had also dispelled the curse of the sage couple on the island called Dadhimukha and had granted permission to the three daughters of the Gandharva king to marry Rama.

**224.** He had destroyed the Vajrakota of King Vajramukha, accepted the Lanka Sundari as his bride, and stationed his army outside the city.

**225.** He had destroyed the Pushpagarika garden, terrified its female guardians, killed many servants, and destroyed the places for drinking water and other necessities.

**226.** He had destroyed the young trees that were constantly nourished by the milk from the breasts of the women who had nurtured them like their own sons.

**227.** He had uprooted the vines with their swaying leaves from the trees and cast them on the ground, making them look like widowed women.

**228.** He had destroyed the various kinds of trees laden with fruits and flowers, leaving them resembling the trees in a graveyard.

Hearing these offenses, Ravana became enraged. He called Hanuman near and bound him with iron chains. ||229||
Sitting on his throne, the ten-headed Ravana, shining like the sun, spoke harshly to Hanuman, whom he had once worshipped, with no mercy. ||230||
"This wicked one is a sinner, shameless and without respect. What is his glory now? He deserves to be cursed. What good is it to look at him? ||231||
Why is this evil one, who has committed many offenses, not killed? Alas! I showed him great kindness before, but he did not appreciate it at all. ||232||
Then the beautiful women, adorned with fine ornaments, who were standing near Ravana, spoke with anger and a faint smile, their eyes closed and their heads shaking, out of disrespect. They said, "O Hanuman! You have attained dominion over the earth by the grace of your master, and you roam freely on earth, devoid of all strength. ||233-235||
You have shown the fruit of your master's favor by becoming a messenger for the earth-dwellers. ||236||
How have you placed Rama and Lakshmana, who are stained with the sin of burning the earth, ahead of Ravana, who has done you so much good? ||237||
It seems you are not the son of the wind god, but born of someone else, because the actions of a low-born person reveal his evil nature. ||238||
A person born of a prostitute does not have any marks on his body, but when he acts wickedly, his low birth becomes apparent. ||239||
Do wild lions in the forest serve jackals? It is rightly said that noble people do not live by relying on the low. ||240||
Although you came many times before and were honored with everything, this time you have come after a long time and have become a traitor, therefore you deserve to be punished. ||241||
Enraged by these words, Hanuman laughed and said, "Who knows who is worthy of punishment by fate without merit?" ||242||

With this evil-minded one, who is close to death, we will see in a few days where you will go. ||243||
The mighty Lakshmana, along with Rama, is approaching. Just as mountains cannot stop the clouds, so too, the king cannot stop him. ||244||
Just as one who is not satisfied by the best of foods, like nectar, obtained according to one's desires, perishes by a single drop of poison, so too, this Dashaanan, who is not satisfied by thousands of women, like fuel for fire, will soon perish due to his lust for other women. ||245-246||
The mind, which has been cultivated with good or bad thoughts, cannot be changed even by Indra himself. ||247||
Advice given to an evil-minded person through hundreds of kind words is futile. It seems that his fate is fixed, and he is destroyed by his own fate. ||248||
When the time of destruction arrives, the intellect of the being is destroyed. Driven by fate, he acts according to his karmic fruition. ||249||
Just as a careless person drinks sweet, fragrant milk mixed with poison and meets destruction, so too, O Ravana, you, who are lustful for the pleasure of other women, will soon meet destruction without a word being spoken. ||250-251||
You have disregarded your gurus, relatives, elders, friends, dear ones, and even your mother, and have engaged in evil deeds. ||252||
You have fallen into the ocean of evil conduct, caught in the whirlpool of lust, and will descend to hell, where you will suffer greatly. ||253||
O Dashaanan, born from the great king Ratnashrava, you, an evil son, have destroyed the lineage of the Rakshasas. ||254||
Your ancestors were noble men who upheld righteousness on earth and conducted themselves with honor, but you are like a husk among them, devoid of substance. ||255||
Thus spoken to, Ravana, his face red with anger, looked at his sword and said, "This arrogant one is full of harsh words and, disregarding the fear of death, is acting boldly in my presence. Therefore, take this wicked one to the middle of the city and quickly bring him to ruin." ||256-257||

Bound with thick iron chains, with long, resounding links, his body dusted with dirt, his neck, hands, and feet bound tight.  He is surrounded by cruel servants, mocked with harsh words, and dragged from house to house.  He weeps at this misfortune.  ||258-259||
Seeing this, the women and the people of the city curse him, their faces contorted and trembling, expressing their grief.  ||260||
Before him, throughout the city, it is proclaimed: "This is the messenger of the earth, the one who has received honor.  Let everyone see him!"  ||261||
Then, filled with rage from the insults, Hanuman broke his bonds and departed, just as a sage breaks free from the fetters of delusion.  ||262||
With a single step, he shattered the towering gate and other doors, soaring into the sky with joy.  ||263||
The palace of Ravana, resembling the abode of Indra, was shattered by Hanuman's foot, leaving only scattered pillars.  ||264||
Though the earth was held firm by great mountains, it trembled at the impact of his feet, shaken by the falling palace.  ||265||
Ravana's house, its golden walls sunk into the earth, riddled with deep pits, became like a mountain crushed by a thunderbolt.  ||266||
Hearing of Hanuman's valor, Sita, the queen of the monkey-kings, adorned with a mark of the monkey on her crown, felt joy and sorrow in equal measure.  ||267||
Then, Vajrodari, seated nearby, said, "Why do you weep in vain, Devi?  Look, Hanuman is flying through the sky, breaking his chains."  ||268||
Hearing these words, and seeing Hanuman departing with his army, Sita's lotus-like eyes blossomed.  ||269||
She thought, "This Hanuman, whose speed is so great even as he departs, will surely tell my lord about me."  ||270||
With a mind filled with hope, Sita offered a flower garland to Hanuman as he departed, just as Lakshmi offers one to the Lord of Power.  ||271||
And all the planets said, "May you have happiness, O son of the wind!  May your obstacles be destroyed, may you live long, and may you enjoy all pleasures."  ||272||

## The Fifty-Third Chapter

**Mālīnīvṛtta**

These noble souls, with their fame pervading all the worlds, were generous in their previous birth. They are free from delusion and capable of destroying karma, which is a source of great wonder and difficult to comprehend. ||273||

Therefore, strive to associate with the virtuous, for by doing so, you will be freed from all insignificant karmas that yield tasteless fruits. You will become a lover of supreme bliss, a being who surpasses the sun in brilliance and engages in delightful pastimes. ||274||

Thus ends the fifty-third chapter of the Padma Purāṇa, known as Ārṣa, narrated by the sage Raviṣena, which describes the return of Hanumān. ||53||

1. **Bodhiślāghyā-m.**

## Chapter Forty-Five

Hanuman, with his banner and umbrella destroyed, reached the city of Kishkindha.  He was greeted by a sea of Kishkindha citizens who had come out to see him.  The brave Hanuman, with his natural grace, entered the city.  The women of the city, with their faces pressed against the windows, were filled with anxiety to see the great warriors with their wounded bodies.  

Upon reaching his own dwelling, Hanuman, like a father, comforted his army and settled them in their respective places.  Then, after meeting with King Sugriva and informing him of the events in Lanka, he went to the feet of Rama to deliver the news.

Rama, filled with anxiety, thought to himself, "The virtuous Hanuman will come and tell me, 'O noble one, your beloved is alive!'"  Rama, with his beautiful body, was becoming increasingly weak.  He was consumed by the fire of separation, just as an elephant is consumed by a forest fire.  He was dwelling in the abyss of great sorrow, and he felt hatred for the entire world.  Hanuman, with folded hands and head bowed, approached him.

First, Hanuman, with his large eyes filled with joy, spoke of Sita's well-being.  Then, with eloquent words, he revealed all the news.  After relating all the details of his recognition and the events that had transpired, he presented the jewel from Sita's crown to King Ramachandra, thus fulfilling his mission.

The jewel was devoid of its luster, as if its brilliance had been extinguished by Rama's sorrow.  Rama, with his weary hands, held the jewel, as if he were exhausted.  The jewel, stained from being tied to Sita's hair, seemed to reflect her suffering. 

Page #363:
---------------------------
The fifty-fourth chapter. The jewel, like a falling vapor, was devoid of luster, his hands clasped in anjali. Was he seen, was he drunk, or was he asked about the news, in confusion? ||12|| The king of the earth, with his fingers thinned by weakness, mourned for the jewel, whose garland of rays was flowing. ||13|| He, too, with his face darkened by the light of the anjali filled with rays, placed the jewel on his head, as if he had wept and offered water in anjali. ||14|| The knowledge of his beloved, which he had placed on his body, was like an embrace of Vaidehi. ||15|| A universal, harsh, and dense thrill arose in his limbs, like a gushing spring of joy. ||16|| Marut, in confusion, embraced him and asked, "Is it true that my delicate beloved is alive, holding her breath?" ||17|| The bowing Vati said, "O lord, she is alive. I have not brought any other news. Be happy, O king of the earth!" ||18|| "But it is certain that the girl, who is a river of virtues, is in the midst of the fire of your separation, making her days miserable with tears, constantly raining." ||19|| "Her hair has lost its luster due to the loosening of her braid, she is extremely sorrowful, she breathes heavily again and again, and she is immersed in the ocean of worry." ||20|| "She was thin-waisted by nature, but now, due to your separation, she appears even thinner. The women of Ravana, filled with anger, constantly worship him." ||21|| "She, abandoning all concern for her body, constantly thinks of you. Thus, O god, your beloved is living a life of sorrow. Do what is appropriate." ||22|| Hearing the words of Samiran, Padma's eyes became dull, and he was filled with anxiety and extreme sorrow for a long time. ||23|| The bearer of a trembling and languid body, he sighed long and hot, and he condemned his life and his birth in many ways. ||24|| 

Page #364:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, knowing their intentions,  Sumitra said, "Why are you grieving, O great intellect?  Focus your mind on what needs to be done." ||25||  "The king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, is known for his procrastination, and Sita's brother,  Bhamandala, is delaying despite repeated calls." ||26|| "Therefore, we will undoubtedly go to the city of the ten-mouthed one tomorrow, either by boats crossing the ocean or swiftly by our arms." ||27||  Then, the great, sweet-voiced, celestial being named Singhanada said, "Do not speak like a proud man. You are a wise person." ||28|| "The fate that befell you in Lanka is now ours. Therefore, we should consider our duty with respect and benefit everyone." ||29|| "The son of the wind, Hanuman, destroyed Lanka, which was adorned with forts, towers, and gardens." ||30|| "Now, the lord of the great Vidyaadharas, Ravana, is enraged, and due to fate, this collective death has come upon us." ||31|| Then, the Vidyaadhara named Chandramarichi spoke with great vigor, "Are you, like a deer, filled with fear of a lion?" ||32|| "It is Ravana who should be afraid. Who is he, and what is his purpose? He has committed injustice, and death is dancing before him." ||33|| "We have many celestial kings, great warriors, endowed with knowledge and power, who have performed miracles thousands of times." ||34|| "They are known as Ghanagati, Teebra, Bhootanada, Gajasvana, Kroora, Kelikil, Bhima, Kunda, Gorati, Angada, Nala, Nila, Tadidvaktara, Mandara, Ashani, Arnava, Chandrajyoti, Mrigendra, Vajradansh, Divakara, Ulka, and Langul, who possesses unwavering valor in the midst of a group of divine weapons. Hanuman, the master of great Vidyaas, Bhamandala, the beautiful one, Mahendraketu, who possesses the power of the fierce wind, Prasannakirti, the one with extraordinary valor, and his powerful sons." ||38||

There are also many other valiant chieftains of Kishkindha, who are steadfast in their duties, obedient and awaiting orders. ||30||
Hearing these words, the celestial beings lowered their eyes in respect towards Rama, the elder brother of Lakshmana. ||40||
Then they saw on his face, where the gentle expression was hidden, a terrible frown, like a thicket of creepers in the abode of Yama. ||41||
They saw that Rama had fixed his gaze on Lanka, a gaze that seemed like the rising line of a comet, foretelling the destruction of the Rakshasas. ||42||
They saw that same gaze, which had long been fixed on the middle, now directed towards his strong bow, which was like a creeper of Yama's brow. ||43||
His hair, trembling with anger, was loose and scattered, as if the treasury of Yama had been opened to engulf the world in darkness. ||44||
His face, situated in the midst of a halo of light, seemed like the blazing young sun of the apocalypse. ||45||
Seeing Rama, who was eager to go and destroy the Rakshasas, the celestial beings were disturbed and prepared to depart. ||46||
Inspired by Rama's actions, all the celestial beings, honoring the words of Chandrama-richika, set out on their journey through the sky. At that time, all the celestial beings were armed with various weapons and adorned with the finest treasures. ||47||
Rama and Lakshmana, filled with the desire for battle, set out, their departure marked by the sound of drums that filled the caves. ||48||
Their departure took place on the fifth day of the month of Margashirsha, at sunrise, and their journey was marked by auspicious omens that increased their enthusiasm. ||49||
At that time, they saw that a smokeless flame was burning in a clockwise direction, a peacock was making a beautiful sound nearby, a woman adorned with the finest ornaments was standing in front of them, and a fragrant breeze was blowing. ||50||

In the Padma Purana, a crow was seen on the left, scattering fresh dung and flapping its wings, emitting a sweet sound. ||52|| The sound of drums and conch shells echoed, "Victory, prosperity, and swift progress, without any obstacles." These auspicious words were uttered. ||53|| With the arrival of celestial beings from all four directions, the army was growing, and Sugriva, resembling the full moon of the bright fortnight, was ready to depart. ||54|| These celestial kings, adorned with various vehicles and celestial chariots, with flags fluttering on their chariots, were flying through the sky with great speed, looking magnificent. ||55|| The king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, Hanuman, Shalya, Durmarshan, Nal, Neel, Kaal, Sushen, and Kumuda, along with other kings, were flying in the sky. Their flags bore the radiant insignia of monkeys, and these powerful celestial beings seemed to be ready to swallow the sky. ||56-57|| The flag of Viradhit bore a garland like a waterfall, Jambavan's flag had a great tree, Simharava's flag had a tiger, Meghakant's flag had an elephant, and the flags of other celestial beings bore various insignia passed down through generations. All of them were adorned with brilliant umbrellas. ||58-59|| A very powerful celestial sound was leading the way, and Hanuman, resembling a guardian deity, was following behind. ||60|| Surrounded by their respective groups of vassals, these extremely powerful and joyful celestial beings were proceeding towards Lanka, looking magnificent. ||61|| Just as earlier, the sons of Sukesh, like Malya, had departed for Lanka, so too, Rama and other kings, mounted on the front of their celestial chariots, were proceeding towards Lanka. ||62|| Viradhit, the celestial being, was standing beside Rama, and Jambavan, accompanied by his ministers, was following behind. ||63|| Sushen was on the left and Sugriva on the right. With this arrangement, they reached the mountain called Velandhar in the blink of an eye. ||64|| The lord of the city of Velandhar was a celestial being named Samudra, who, through a great battle,

Chapter Forty-Five
349. Then, having defeated Nal, the ocean-dwelling, celestial being, who was strong in arms, and whose army was slain, was bound. ||66||
Having been honored and released, he was established in the rule of Padma-nama. ||67||
Satyashri, Kamala, Gunamala, and Ratna-chula, all adorned with the qualities of women, were conceived by the ocean-dwelling, celestial being, who was delighted, as if they were the wives of the gods, for Lakshmana, the son of Lakshmīdhara. ||68-69||
Having stayed there for one night, they went to Suvela-giri. There, in the city of Suvela, there was a celestial being named Suvela. ||70||
Having defeated him also in battle, with ease, the celestial beings played there, delighted, like the gods in Nandana. ||71||
Then, in the delightful Akshaya forest, they spent the night comfortably, and the others, adorned with excellent beauty, were eager to go to Lanka. ||72||
That Lanka, which was adorned with high ramparts, filled with golden mansions, adorned with white lotuses like the peaks of Kailasa, illuminated with various kinds of floors and light, filled with lotus forests, adorned with the creations of wells, etc., adorned with lofty, multi-colored Jain temples, and pure, like the city of Mahendra, was seen by all the celestial beings, who were the best of the celestial beings, and they stayed in the Hamsa-dvipa, filled with joy. ||73-76||
Having defeated the mighty king Hamsa-ratha in battle, in the delightful city of Hamsa-pura, they played as they wished. ||77||
The messenger has been sent again and again, and he will surely come today or tomorrow. They were waiting, hoping for that. ||78||
The venerable Gautama says that the virtuous beings, wherever they go,

Padma Purana
Therefore, the desire to enjoy the terrible world of **moksha** is a **karma** done by the **bhoktus**. The **iladhya** dharma, the essence of all, has emerged from the mouth of the **Jinavara**. Let the perishable association with **bhoga** be destroyed, even **moksha** is attained from this dharma. Even the sun, from this dharma, goes to the bright **bhavya** world. ||40||
Thus ends the 54th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as **Arsha**, narrated by **Ravishena Acharya**, describing the departure for Lanka. ||54|| 

Page #369:
---------------------------
## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter

Knowing that the enemy's army was close at hand, Lanka was filled with anxiety, like the ocean at the time of the deluge. ||1||

Dasanana, his mind filled with anxiety, was filled with a little anger. The people, gathered in groups, discussed the battle. ||2||

The fear-inducing drums, whose sound was like the roar of the ocean, were beaten. The sound of trumpets and conch shells resounded in the sky. ||3||

The soldiers, filled with joy at the sound of the war drums, were ready for battle, eager to serve their lord. ||4||

Maricha, Amalachandra, Bhaskara, Syandana, Hasta, Prahasta, and many other warriors, clad in armor, stood by their lord. ||5||

Seeing the valiant Lankeshvara ready for battle, Vibhishana approached him, bowed his head, and folded his hands in respect. ||6||

He spoke, his words filled with wisdom, a master of language and meaning, a scholar of the scriptures, a wise and calm man, advocating for what was right, beneficial for his people, both in the present and the future. ||7-8||

He said, "O Lord! Your wealth is vast and magnificent, like that of Indra. Your fame, pure as the white lotus, fills the sky and the earth. ||9||

"O Lord! O Supreme Being! Let not this moment of transgression, caused by another's wife, destroy your spotless fame, like the line of a cloud at sunset. Be pleased! ||10||

"Therefore, quickly hand over Sita to Rama. What purpose does she serve you? There is no fault in handing her over, only virtue. ||11||

"O wise one! You are immersed in the ocean of happiness, so sit comfortably. Your own possessions are all around you, without fault. ||12|| 

Page #370:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
It is said that when Janaki was in the presence of Padmanabha, her own nature's connection was most praiseworthy. ||13||
Hearing these words of Indrajit, who knew his father's heart, spoke words that were most arrogant and against the scriptures. ||14|| He said, "O virtuous one, who asked you? What authority do you have to speak such words, like those of a madman?" ||15|| "If you are truly impatient, cowardly, or impotent, then stay comfortably in your own home. What is the purpose of your words?" ||16|| "For whom, in the midst of a terrifying battle, filled with the darkness of a herd of maddened elephants, and a multitude of falling weapons, was Lakshmi, the beautiful heroine, earned by your arm, after great hardship?" ||17-18|| "Having obtained this most rare and excellent jewel of a woman, why are you abandoning her like a fool? Therefore, your words are useless." ||19|| Then, eager to rebuke, Vibhishana said, "You are the son of Ravana, the enemy of this one, who has a polluted mind." ||20|| "You, blinded by your own self-interest, are drowning in cold water at the behest of another." ||21|| "You are filling the fire that has erupted in your house with dry fuel. Alas! Your actions are contrary to your own good, because you are afflicted by the demon of delusion." ||22|| "Until this golden Lanka, with its ramparts and magnificent buildings, is pulverized by Lakshmana's sharp arrows, it is right to quickly hand over the virtuous princess, Sita, to Rama, who has a steadfast mind, for the welfare of all beings." ||23-24|| "Your father, with his evil mind, did not bring Sita here, but brought a poison-herb to this city of Lanka, a den for serpent-like demons." ||25|| "You are not capable of surrounding Lakshmana, who is like a lion in the forefront of battle, and who is the best among those who possess Lakshmi, and who is filled with anger, even though you are like elephants." ||26||

## The Fifth Chapter of the Panchapaksha

**353**  Whose bow is like the ocean's swirl, and whose arrows are like the sun's rays, and whose wings are like the Bhamandala, how can he be conquered by men? **27**  Those who are bowed before him, the great lords of the sky, the Mahendras, the Malayas, the Tirthas, the Sriparvatas, the Kishkindhas, the Tripuras, the Ratnadvipas, the Velandharas, the Alakas, the Kelikilas, the Gaganatilakas, the Sandhyas, the Haihayas, the Pragbharas, and the Dadhimukhas, all these great and proud kings, endowed with knowledge and power, are they not Vidhyadharas? **28-30**  Hearing Vibhishana speak thus in a loud voice, Ravana, filled with rage, drew his sword and stood ready to kill him. **31**  And Vibhishana, also filled with anger, and being given this example, uprooted a great vajra-like pillar. **32**  These two brothers, eager for battle and possessing fierce energy, were restrained with great difficulty by their ministers. Then, after being restrained, they went to their respective places. **33**  Then Ravana, his heart hardened, spoke to his chief advisors, Kumbhakarna, Indrajit, and others, saying, "This one, who is like fire, is intent on harming my refuge. Let him quickly leave my city." **34-35**  "What good is it to have him here, whose mind is set on doing harm? I have no use for one who acts against me, even if he is my own limb." **36**  "If I do not bring him to death here, then I am not Ravana." **37**  "Am I not also the son of Ratnashrava?" **38**  Saying this, Vibhishana, full of pride, left Lanka. **39**  He was surrounded by thirty Akshauhini armies, each equipped with beautiful weapons, and was ready to go to the shelter of Padma. **40**  Vidhyudghana, Iभवज्र, Indraprachanda, Chapal, Kala, Mahakala, and other great warriors, who were under the protection of Vibhishana, raised their vajra-like weapons, and with their inner fortresses and all their wealth, adorned with various weapons, they were ready to go. **41**

They set out, their chariots adorned, covering the sky, and arrived at the Hamsa-dvipa, accompanied by their families. ||42|| They stayed on the beautiful shore of that island, adorned with rivers, just as the gods stay on the Nandishvara-dvipa. ||43|| Just as the bodies of the poor tremble all over when the cold season arrives, so too the bodies of the monkeys trembled all over when Vibhishana arrived. ||44|| Lakshmana, who held the Sagara-avarta bow, looked towards the Surya-hasa sword, and Rama, who held the Lakshmi-bhrit-aksha, touched the Vajra-avata bow. ||45|| The ministers, agitated, gathered together and consulted among themselves, and just as the army of elephants gathers in a herd when frightened by a lion, so too the entire army of monkeys gathered in a herd, frightened. ||46|| Then Vibhishana sent his wise and eloquent doorkeeper to Rama. ||47|| When summoned, he went to the assembly, sat down and paid his respects. Then he spoke in order about the conflict between the two brothers. ||48|| Then he said, "O Lord! O Padma! Vibhishana, who is always engaged in the work of Dharma, begs at your feet in this way: O compassionate one who protects the helpless! I have come to your refuge with devotion. So please grant me your favor by giving me your command." ||49-50|| When the doorkeeper said this, a good counsel arose among the ministers close to Rama. ||51|| The minister Matikanta said, "Perhaps Ravana sent him deceitfully, for the actions of kings are strange." ||52|| "Or perhaps the family, which has been stained by mutual conflict, will surely regain its purity, like water." ||53|| Then the wise minister named Mati-sagara said, "It is heard from the mouths of people that there has been a conflict between these two brothers." ||54|| "It is heard that Vibhishana is a follower of Dharma, a great statesman, his mind is cleansed by the water of the scriptures, and he is always eager to do favors." ||55|| "Brotherhood is not the reason here, but their own separate actions are the reason. The effect of those actions is constantly present in the world, creating diversity." ||56||

In this chapter, you should listen to my story, in the village of Naisika, there were two young Brahmanas named Giri and Gobhuti. ||57|| In the same village, the king Suryadeva's queen, Matipriya, gave these two boys a gift of gold in large earthen pots, covered with rice, as a virtuous act. Giri, seeing the gold in the pots, killed the other boy out of greed and took the gold. ||58-59|| Another story is that in the city of Kaushambi, there lived a merchant named Brihadghana. His wife's name was Kuruvinda, and they had two sons named Ahideva and Mahideva. When their father died, they went somewhere by boat. Fearing that someone might steal their wealth in their absence, they took all their valuables with them. There, they sold all their belongings and bought a precious gem. Whoever held the gem among the two brothers would want to kill the other. ||60-62|| Both brothers, revealing their evil thoughts to each other, returned home together and, renouncing the world, gave the gem to their mother. ||63|| The mother also wanted to kill both her sons by giving them poison, but later she attained knowledge. After that, the mother and both sons, renouncing the world, threw the gem into the Yamuna River, where a fish swallowed it. ||64|| A fisherman caught that fish and sold it to the same three people. Later, their sister, while cutting the fish, saw the gem. ||65|| Driven by greed and delusion, she wanted to kill her mother and both brothers by giving them poison, but she calmed down due to affection. ||66|| Later, knowing each other's intentions, they crushed the gem with stones and threw it away. After that, renouncing the world, they all took initiation. ||67|| This story clearly proves that greed for wealth, etc., causes enmity even among brothers, etc., in the world. The bond of birth is not the cause. ||68|| In this story, enmity is seen, but it is pacified again due to divine will. In the previous story, Giri killed his own brother Gobhuti. ||69|| Therefore, this messenger, who is very intelligent and discerning, should bring a clear example that is not appropriate here. ||70||

Padma Purana
Then Vibhishana was called by the commander, and he went and informed him. Then Padma Ratna Shrava's son arrived. ||71||
Vibhishana bowed and said, "O Lord, in this birth you are my master, and in the next birth you are the Jina Nath." ||72||
When Vibhishana had sworn this oath of purity, Rama said without doubt, "I will make you the king of Lanka, be without doubt." ||73||
While the celebration of Vibhishana's arrival was going on, the son of Pushpavati, who had mastered many Mahavidyas, arrived. ||74||
Seeing the arrival of Bhamandala, the lord of victory, and the most powerful, Rama and others greatly honored him. ||75||
After spending eight days in the city called Hansa, and having firmly established his duty, they all set out for Lanka. ||76||
Then, with chariots, various vehicles, horses as swift as the wind, elephants with the radiance of monsoon clouds, servants filled with love, and heroes adorned with armor, the Vidhyadhara kings were coming with great enthusiasm, covering the sky on all sides. ||77-78||
The very valiant monkey kings, who were leading the way, reached the battlefield first, and this was fitting for them. ||79||
The width of this battlefield was twenty yojanas, and its length was immeasurable. ||80||
With thousands of warriors bearing various weapons and different signs, the battlefield seemed like the world of death. ||81||
Then, hearing the sound of elephants, horses, lions, and drums, Ravana, who had received the festival after a long time, was filled with great joy. ||82||
He honored all his vassals by giving them orders, and rightly so, because he had never deprived them of the joy of battle. ||83||

The Fifty-Fifth Chapter
357. The kings of the cities of Suryodaya, Amrita, Shobha, Singha, Nritya-geeta, Lakshmi-geeta, Kinnara-geeta, Bahunada, Mahasail, Chakra, Suranupa, Srimanta, Malaya-ananda, Sriguha, Srimanohara, Ripunjaya, Shashi-sthana, Martanda-abha, Vishala, Jyotir-danda, Parikshoda, Ashva-ratna, and Parajaya, along with their ministers, arrived before Ravana, pleased. ||45||
86. Ravana honored these kings with weapons, vehicles, and armor, just as Indra honors the gods. ||89||
90. Learned men have stated that the strength of Ravana's army was four thousand Akshauhinis. This force was complete in its own strength. ||90||
91. The strength of the army of Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, was one thousand Akshauhinis, and the strength of the army of Bhammandala was slightly more than one thousand Akshauhinis. ||91||
92. Sugriva and Bhammandala, always vigilant and dedicated to their cause, remained near Rama and Lakshmana, along with their ministers. ||92||
93. At that time, various lineages, various races, various virtues, and various actions, all renowned and uttering various sounds, gathered on the battlefield. ||93||
94. Gautama Swami says, "O King! Due to the influence of virtue, even the enemy kings of great men become their own, and the long-time friends of the wicked become their enemies at the time of destruction." ||94||
95. "This is my brother, this is my friend, this is under my control, this is my relative, and this is my constant benefactor," - a man who knows the complexities of the world, who is endowed with the sun of intellect, should never think in this way. ||95||
Thus ends the Fifty-Fifth Chapter of the Padma Purana, named Vibhishana-samagama, narrated by the sage Ravishena, known as Aarsha. ||55||

## The Fifty-Sixth Chapter

The Magadha king then asked the Ganadhara, "O Muni, please tell me the measure of an Akshauhini." ||1||

Indrabhuti, the Ganadhara, replied, "O King Shrenik, listen, I will tell you the measure of an Akshauhini in brief." ||2||

"There are eight well-known types of divisions for the four limbs of an army: elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers. I will explain these divisions to you." ||3||

"The first division is called Patti, the second is Sena, the third is Senamukha, the fourth is Gulma, the fifth is Vahini, the sixth is Pritana, the seventh is Chamu, and the eighth is Anikini." ||4||

"Now I will tell you how these divisions are formed." ||5||

"One chariot, one elephant, five foot soldiers, and three horses constitute a Patti." ||6||

"Three Pattis make a Sena, three Senas make a Senamukha, three Senamukhas make a Gulma." ||7||

"Three Gulmas make a Vahini, three Vahinis make a Pritana, three Pritanas make a Chamu, and three Chamus make an Anikini." ||8||

"Wise men say that ten Anikinis make an Akshauhini. Now, O Shrenik, I will tell you the separate numbers of each limb in an Akshauhini." ||9||

"In an Akshauhini, there are twenty-one thousand eight hundred and seventy chariots, shining like the sun." ||10||

"The number of elephants is the same as the number of chariots." ||11||

"There are one lakh nine thousand three hundred and fifty foot soldiers in an Akshauhini." ||12||

"The number of horses in an Akshauhini is sixty-five thousand six hundred and ten." ||13||

"Knowing this strength of Ravana's army, which consisted of four thousand Akshauhinis, the army of Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, marched towards Ravana without fear." ||14||

"When Rama's army approached, there was a discussion among the people of different factions." ||15||

## The Fiftieth Chapter

1. Behold, the moon-like Ravana, adorned with the celestial garland of knowledge, is veiled by the clouds of his desires for other women. (16)
2. He who possesses eighteen thousand wives, all living in comfort, is now consumed by grief for a single Sita. (17)
3. Who will be destroyed, the Rakshasas or the Vanaras? This doubt lingered in the minds of both armies. (18)
4. On the side of the Vanaras, there is Maruti, fierce as the god of love, his valor blazing like the sun, a vanquisher of Indra. (19)
5. Some said, "Ravana's army is vast as the ocean, extremely powerful, and comparable to the army of the Daityas." (20)
6. Have you never known the difference between a hero and a coward? Have you forgotten the past? Do you not recognize a valiant man? (21)
7. Remember the fierce battle in the heart of the great Dandaka forest, where Lakshmana, the valiant one, encountered the son of Chandra, Viradha, who was equal to him in strength. (22)
8. Lakshmana, with his unmatched prowess, the abode of Lakshmi, vanquished Viradha and sent him to Yama's abode. (23)
9. Do you not know the unparalleled strength of Lakshmana, whose chest is the abode of Lakshmi? (24)
10. Alone, the son of the wind, Hanuman, calmed Mandodari, comforted Sita, and defeated Ravana's formidable army. He shattered Lanka, its gates and ramparts broken. (25-26)
11. Hearing these words of truth from the wise, the proud Sumakha, the Rakshasa, laughed and spoke. (27)
12. He said, "Where is this army of the Vanaras, insignificant as the hoof of a cow? And where is this vast and powerful army of the dwellers of Trikuta, like the ocean itself?" (28)
13. Ravana, the lord of the Vidyadharas, who could not be subdued even by Indra, how can he be conquered by a single archer? (29)
14. Who can even utter the name of Ravana, the half-chakravarti, who stands above all the glorious beings? (30) 

Page #378:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, the hero with mighty arms, Kumbhakarna, is invincible even to the gods. Who in the world does not know this mighty Kumbhakarna? (31) He who wields the trident, who shines like the fire of destruction in battle, and whose prowess is unmatched in the world, who can conquer him? (32) When his umbrella is raised, like the autumn moon rising, the darkness of the enemy army is destroyed on all sides. (33) Who in the world, even with a desire for his own life, is strong enough to stand before him, who has such great power? (34)

Thus, the words of those who were driven by hatred and attachment, who revealed the difficulties of their own desires, and whose actions were diverse, created a complex and doubtful path for both sides. (35) Gautama Swami says that those who remain attached to passion and aversion even at the time of the birth of restraint, even when they reach another existence, their mental path remains the same - they remain addicted to passion and aversion. This is appropriate, because a person's own character, like the sun, guides him in his self-work. (36)

Thus ends the fifty-sixth chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which describes the departure of the armies of Rama and Ravana. (56)

The warriors who were eager to taste the sweet nectar of fame, who were mounted on chariots drawn by elephants, and who had not endured the sound of the enemy army, emerged from Lanka.  They were Hast and Prahast, two kings whose great prowess had already been revealed and who were adorned with valor.  ||42-43|| Although they did not ask their lord before leaving, it was not fitting for them to ask at that time, for even a fault can become a virtue when the occasion demands it. ||44|| 
Maricha, Singhavana, Swayambhu, Shambhu, Uttama, Prithu adorned with a vast army, Chandra, Surya, Shuka, Sarana, Gaja, Vibhatsa, Vajraksha who possessed the brilliance of Indra, Gambhira-nada, Nakra, Vajranada, Ugranatha, Sunda, Nikumbha, Sandhyaksha, Vibhrama, cruel, Malyavan, Kharanada, Jambumali, Shikhavira, and the mighty Durddhasa, all these chieftains mounted on chariots drawn by lions, emerged. ||45-48||
Following them were Vajrodara, Shakrabha, Krtaanta, Vighatodara, Mahavajrarava, Chandranakha, Mrtyu, Subhisana, Vajrodara, Dhumraksha, Mudita, Vidyujjhihva, Mahaamali, Kanaka, Krodhanadhvani, Kshobhana, Dhundhu, Uddhama, Dindi, Dindim, Dambara, Prachanda, Damara, Chanda, Kunda, and Halahala, etc., all these chieftains, whose chariots were drawn by tigers, were tall and illuminated the sky.  All these chieftains were arrogant and possessed a desire to destroy their enemies. ||49-52||
Behind them emerged Vidya-koshika, Sarpavahu, Mahadyuti, Shankha, Prasankha, Raga, Bhinnaanjanaprabha, Pushpachuda, Maharakta, Ghatastra, Pushpakhechara, Anangakusuma, Kama, Kamavart, Smarayana, Kamagni, Kamarashi, Kanakabha, Shilimukha, Saumyavaktra, Mahakama, and Hemagaura, etc., all these chieftains, mounted on chariots drawn by horses as swift as the wind, emerged from their homes in due order.  The armies of all these chieftains were making a tremendous noise. ||53-56||

## The Fifty-Seventh Chapter

**58.** The Samantas, such as Hladan, Chapal, Chol, Chal, and Chanchal, mounted on resplendent chariots, adorned with elephants and other animals, set out.

**59.** Gautama Swami said, "O Srenic! How many prominent men shall be mentioned by name? Wise men say that there were a total of four and a half crore Kumaras at that time."

**60.** All these Kumaras were of pure Rakshasa lineage, possessed equal prowess, renowned for their glory, and adorned with virtues.

**61.** Surrounded by these Kumaras, eager for battle, the mighty and handsome Kumaras, like Meghavahan and others, also set out.

**62.** Indrajit, who was like the Sun in brilliance and most dear to Ravana, a wise and valiant warrior, set out, resembling Jayanta.

**63.** Kumbhakarna, wielding the Trishula weapon, mounted on the great Jyotiprabha chariot, which shone like the Sun, set out.

**64.** Shakravakrama, who was like Indra in prowess and shone like the Sun, mounted on the Pushpaka chariot, which resembled the peak of Mount Meru and was renowned in the three worlds, set out.

**65.** Ravana, with his army, whose weapons shone brightly, covered the sky and earth, and set out, his radiance resembling the rays of the Sun.

**66.** The Samantas set out on various vehicles, such as chariots, elephants, lions, boars, deer, camels, birds, bulls, camels, horses, and buffaloes, born in water, land, and the sea.

**67.** The lords of the celestial beings, who were enraged at the Bhāmandala and Sugriva, and who were well-wishers of Ravana, set out.

**68.** Then, from the south, fearsome bears, roaring loudly, were seen, ready to stop the journey, standing in a circle.

**69.** Fearsome vultures, with their wings creating dense darkness, their cries distorted, and announcing great destruction, were flying in the sky.

**70.** Other cruel birds, crying out and announcing fear, were also agitated, both terrestrial and aerial.

**71.** The Rakshasa army, filled with pride in their valor, even though they were inauspicious, set out to fight, their great army surging forward.

**Padma Purana**

When the time for the fruition of karma arrives, all the appropriate results are obtained with certainty. Even Indra, the king of the gods, is not capable of stopping them in this world. What to speak of other beings, their words are just words. ||73||

The valiant warriors, with their minds fixed on battle, great and mounted on their vehicles, their hands adorned with the brilliance of weapons, or with weapons in their hands, disregarded all the inauspicious omens and advanced fearlessly, just as Rahu advances towards the Sun. ||74||

Thus ends the fifty-seventh chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Ravana's Army Leaving Lanka," narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||57||

Padma Purana
These, adorned with beautiful horses, swift chariots driven by desire, stationed amidst a great army, approached the battlefield. ||17||
Vidyutvaha, Marudvahu, Sanu, Jaladavaha, Raviyana, Prachandali, these too, resembling wealth, ||18||
With many great charioteers, their banners ablaze with various fires, filled with faith in battle, they raced like the wind. ||19||
Vibhishana, the devoted one, mounted a great, excellent aircraft named Ratnaprabha. ||20||

Padmanabha, Sumitraja, Sugriva, Janakatmaja, these, seated in swan-like aircraft, shone in the sky. ||24||
Resembling great clouds, they were mounted on various vehicles, these celestial kings, eager to go towards Lanka. ||25||
The sounds of trumpets, mixed with the roar of millions of conch shells, arose, like the roar of the deluge, terrifying, free from fault. ||26||

## The Eighty-Fifth Chapter

With warriors emerging from their respective ranks, both armies, fueled by intolerance and pride, appeared extremely fearsome.  || 33 || 

Soon, a fierce battle erupted between the two armies, employing weapons like chakra, krakacha, kuntha, khadga, gada, shakti, arrows, and bhindimal. || 34 ||

Warriors, shouting encouragement to each other, clad in armor, their arms ablaze with weapons, leaped forward, eager to penetrate the enemy ranks. || 35 ||

These warriors, propelled by immense speed, initially plunged into the enemy's ranks, then retreated slightly, seeking a suitable path to wield their weapons. || 36 ||

The Lankans, with their superior numbers and strength, overwhelmed the Vanara-Paksha warriors, just as lions subdue elephants. || 37 ||

However, the valiant and radiant Vanara kings, who could not be subdued by other warriors, swiftly retaliated, slaying the Rakshasa warriors. || 38 ||

Witnessing their army crumbling on all sides, the Rakshasa king's two commanders, Hast and Prahast, driven by loyalty to their master and surrounded by a massive force, rose to the challenge.  They were easily identifiable by their elephant-emblazoned flags, rode on elephant chariots, and roared, "Fear not, fear not!"  They possessed exceptional physiques and immense speed, and their arrival unleashed a fierce onslaught on the Vanara army. || 39-41 ||

Seeing this, Nal and Neel, the Vanara princes, renowned for their valor, mounted on chariots drawn by boars, elephants, and horses, their bodies radiating pride and courage, their forms ablaze with brilliance, and fueled by righteous anger, prepared to engage in battle. || 42-43 ||

The ensuing battle, a cacophony of clashing weapons, echoed with the cries of "Sadhu, Sadhu" (well done, well done), and was filled with fallen warriors.  Nal, leaping forward, disarmed and routed Hast, while Neel, with a single blow, ended Prahast's life. || 44-45 ||

The king, witnessing the defeat of Hast and Prahast, realized that the Vanara army was now victorious. || 46 ||

## Chapter 58: The Killing of Hand by Hand

**Verse 46:** Seeing the earth-bound army of Ravana, the soldiers, devoid of their leader, turned away and fled.

**Verse 47:** This is indeed true, for as long as a man sees the raised face of his master, he holds firm his resolve. But when his master is destroyed, the entire army, like a wheel whose hub is broken, scatters.

**Verse 48:** The Acharya says, even those with firm resolve cannot accomplish their tasks without a leader. For when the head is lost, the body is destined for destruction on all sides.

**Verse 49:** This entire world, bound to its leader, attains its desired fruits. Just as the rays of the sun, afflicted by Rahu, become dim and perish, so too does everything else.

**Verse 50:** Thus ends the fifty-eighth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, which narrates the killing of Hand by Hand.

The One-Hundred-and-Eighty-Fourth Chapter

The King Shrenika then said to the Lord Gotama, "O Bhagavan! Those two Samantas, Hasta and Prahasta, who were skilled in the art of warfare and had never been defeated by anyone, how is it that they were killed by Nal and Neel? O Lord! Please tell me the reason for this."

Gotama, the Ganadhara, who was a knower of the secrets of the scriptures, then said, "O King! This is the way of beings who are driven by their karmas.

"Due to the influence of past karma, this is the state of wicked beings: whoever killed someone in the past will be killed by that person in the present.

"Whoever freed a man who had fallen into misfortune in the past will also free him from bondage and suffering in the present.

"Here is their story: In the city of Kushasthal, there lived two poor families who followed the norms of the world.

"Among them were two brothers, Indhaka and Pallava, born from the same mother. They were burdened by their wives and children, were Brahmanas by caste, and worked as plowmen. They were compassionate by nature, averse to the criticism of the virtuous, and devoted to the service of their Jain friend, such as offering food and other things.

"There was another poor couple living near them, who were cruel by nature, wicked, and deluded by worldly wrong practices.

"Once, when there was a dispute over the distribution of the king's donation, those two cruel poor families killed Indhaka and Pallava.

"Due to the merit of their donations to the monks, both of them became Aryas in the Harikshetra, enjoying excellent pleasures. They lived for two Palkis there. After their lifespan was complete, both of them were born in the Devaloka.

"The other two cruel poor families, due to the consequences of their evil deeds, died and were reborn as rabbits in the Kalajar forest, filled with suffering.

"This is indeed the case, because those who are endowed with wrong views and engage in the criticism of the virtuous, who are the worst of creatures, will inevitably face such a fate."

Thus, after wandering for a long time in various species of the lower orders, they attained human birth with great difficulty and became ascetics. ||14|| They had long matted hair, large bodies, and subsisted on fruits and leaves. They were weakened by severe austerities and died due to wrong knowledge. ||15|| They were born as two sons from the womb of Ashvini, a woman of the Vidyadhara race, in the south of Mount Vijaya, the son of Agni. ||16|| These two were known throughout the world as Asura-like in their swiftness of action. They became the ministers of Ravana, named Hastagrah and Prahast. ||17|| Previously, Indhaka and Pallava, who have been mentioned before, fell from heaven and attained the excellent human birth. After performing austerities in the householder stage, they became excellent gods. ||18|| Due to the depletion of their merit, they fell from heaven and were born in the city of Kiku as Nala and Nila, possessing great strength. ||19|| The fruit of the act of Hastagrah and Prahast, who had killed Nala and Nila in a previous birth, returned to them in this birth, i.e., they were killed by them. ||20|| In a previous birth, whoever kills someone, is killed by that person in this birth. Whoever protects someone in a previous birth, is protected by that person in this birth. And whoever is indifferent to someone in a previous birth, remains indifferent to that person in this birth. ||21|| One should know for certain that whoever, when seen, arouses anger without any reason, is an enemy in the other world. ||22|| And whoever, when seen, makes the mind and eyes rejoice, should be known for certain as a friend from a previous birth. ||23|| The crocodiles, fish, etc., that harm the man in a dilapidated boat in the surging waters of the ocean, and the Mlechchas who harm him on land, are all the fruits of his evil deeds. ||24|| Even if there is a battle or not, with maddened elephants like mountains, warriors wielding various weapons, horses with great speed, and arrogant servants wearing armor, the protection of a man devoid of merit does not arise. ||25-26|| On the contrary, the virtuous man, wherever he goes, wherever he leaves,

**28.** It is seen that even a wealthy and valiant man, surrounded by his family and embraced by his father, succumbs to death. No other man is capable of protecting him.

**29.** Whether there is war or not, a man is protected by the well-cultivated gifts, vows, and conduct, along with right faith.

**30.** The desire for a long life is utterly futile for one who has not earned merit through compassion, generosity, and other virtues in past lives.

**31.** Knowing that the karmas of people do not perish without austerity, wise men should practice forgiveness even towards their enemies.

**32.** This virtuous man benefits me, and this extremely wicked man harms me. It is not wise for people to think this way, because the cause lies in their own accumulated karmas.

**33.** Having understood this, wise men should not be attached to the causes of pleasure and pain, which are external and secondary. They should abandon all wicked actions and not be tainted by intense attachment or aversion.

**34.** When a path obscured by dense darkness is illuminated by the sun, a sighted person does not fall into pits, stumble upon stones, or encounter snakes.

**59.** Thus ends the sixty-first chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the sage Ravi, and describing the previous lives of Hast-Prahast and Nal-Neel.

**27.** Where there is stability, austerity and generosity alone provide protection. In truth, neither gods nor relatives offer protection.

On the following day, many warriors filled with intense anger, rose to fight, having heard of the deaths of Hast and Prahast, the valiant heroes.  ||1||

Among them were: Marich, Singhaghan, Swayambhu, Shambhu, Ajit, Shuka, Saran, Chandra, Arka, Jagadvibhats, Nishswan, Jwar, Ugra, Nak, Makar, Vajrakhya, Udyam, Nishthura, Gambhir, Ninad, and others.  All these warriors were armed and ready for battle, riding chariots drawn by lions and strong horses, and they rushed towards the army of the Vanaras, causing great commotion. ||2-4||

Seeing these great Rakshasa kings approaching, the chieftains of the Vanara clan prepared for battle. ||5||

Some of their names were: Madan, Ankur, Santap, Prasthit, Akrosh, Nandan, Durit, Anagh, Pushpastra, Vighna, and Protikar. ||6||

Both sides clashed in a fierce battle, their weapons of all kinds filling the sky with a tangled web of destruction. ||7||

In that battle, Santap desired to fight Marich; Prathit, Singhaghan; Vighna, Udyam; Akrosh, Saran; Pap, Shuka; and Nandan, Jwar.  Thus, the battle raged on, filled with the rivalry of these warriors. ||8-9||

Then, Marich, filled with anguish, struck down Santap.  Nandan, with great effort, killed Jwar with a spear to the chest. ||10||

Singhaghan killed Prathit, and Udyam killed Vighna.  Then, the sun set, and the battle for that day came to an end. ||11||

Hearing of the deaths of their husbands, the women were plunged into an ocean of grief, and they considered that night to be endless. ||12||

On the following day, warriors filled with intense anger, rose to fight, including: Vajrakhya, Kshapitari, Mrigendra-daman, Vidhi, Shambhu, Swayambhu, Chandra, Arka, Vanodara, and others from the Rakshasa side, as well as other Vanara warriors. ||13-14||

**15.** Driven by the intense surge of anger-karma accumulated over lifetimes, they, devoid of any attachment to their own lives, became eager to engage in a terrible battle.

**16.** Filled with great anger, Kshapitari roared, summoning the mighty Singhadaman, whose arms were adorned with strength. Vitapi called upon the Law. Thus, a great battle ensued, where countless warriors, unknown by name, fell like stones raining down.

**17.** Shārdala, who had been struck first, struck back at Vajrodara. Kshapitari, who had fought for a long time, killed the enraged one.

**18.** Shambhu struck down Vishāladhyuti, and the self-born one, with a blow from his staff, brought death to Vijay. Vitapi, with great difficulty, was slain by the Law with a blow from his mace. Thus, at that time, hundreds of Samantas were killed by other Samantas.

**19-20.** Seeing his army being defeated, Sugriva, filled with extreme anger, was preparing to don his armor. Meanwhile, Hanuman, who covered the earth with his army, mounted a golden chariot drawn by elephants and rose to fight.

**21-22.** Just as a herd of cows is terrified and scatters at the sight of a lion, so too, the Rakshasa Samantas were terrified and scattered at the sight of Hanuman.

**23.** The Rakshasas said to each other, "This is Hanuman, the banner of the Vanaras. Today, he will make many women widows."

**24.** Mali, the best of the Rakshasas, eager for battle, stood before Hanuman. Hanuman, in turn, drew his arrow and stood before him.

**25.** A great battle ensued between the two, with arrows drawn to their ears, each uttering precise words with utmost ferocity.

**26.** The advisors fought with the advisors, the charioteers with the charioteers, and the horsemen with the horsemen, all eager to engage in righteous battle.

**27.** Seeing Mali destroyed by the power of the son of the wind, Vajrodara, the most valiant, stood before Hanuman.

**28.** After fighting for a long time, Hanuman disarmed him. Vajrodara, mounting another chariot, rushed towards Hanuman.

**29.** Hanuman, having disarmed him again, lifted his chariot high into the air, like the wind.

In the Padma Purana, the chariot-pulling elephants were crushed to pieces by him, and he gave up his life in the battlefield, even without a roar. ||31|| Then, enraged by the death of his own side, Jambumali, the valiant son of Ravana, stood before him. ||32|| As soon as he stood up, he severed the banner marked with the monkey emblem of the son of Vayu with an arrow resembling a crescent moon. ||33|| The bow of Maruti, who was delighted by the destruction of the banner, was broken, and his armor was taken away, reduced to the state of old, worn-out cloth. ||34|| Then the son of Mandodari, wearing a strong new armor, struck the son of Marut with sharp arrows on his chest. ||35|| The one who possessed the courage and wisdom of a mountain, enjoyed that pleasure as if it were the pleasure arising from the touch of the withered stalks of a young blue lotus. ||36|| Then, with a crooked arrow like the sixth moon, the son of Vayu released a hundred fierce lions from Jambumali's chariot. ||37|| With their terrifying fangs and flashing red eyes, those lions leaped and threw their entire army into confusion. ||38|| In the midst of that ocean of soldiers, they appeared like huge waves, or like extremely powerful, cruel crocodiles. ||39|| Those lions, resembling a circle of blazing lightning bolts, caused great turmoil in the cloud-like mass of the army. ||40|| In the midst of the wheel of the battlefield, the beings of the army were greatly afflicted by the deeds of the lions on all sides. ||41|| Horses, maddened elephants, and chariot riders, all were bewildered and fled in all directions, abandoning the business of war. ||42|| Then, after all the vassals had fled as they should, Hanuman saw Ravana standing in the distance. ||43|| Then, mounting a chariot drawn by extremely brilliant lions, he drew his bow and aimed at Ravana's half-face. ||44||

## The Sixty-First Canto

**377**

Seeing his army terrified by Dasha-Asya (Ravana) and his own strength, and seeing the invincible Hanumana, who was like Yama, approaching, Ravana, who was eager to don his armor, decided to engage in battle.  

**45-46**

As soon as Ravana contemplated war, Mahoudara, who was seated beside him, rose up in anger.

**47**

While Mahoudara and Hanumana were engaged in battle, the escaped lions were gradually captured by their wise masters.

**48**

Seeing the lions subdued, all the Rakshasas, whose anger was burning, rushed upon the son of the wind (Hanumana).

**49**

However, the extremely skilled Hanumana, with his army of arrows, repelled all the Rakshasas who were releasing showers of arrows.

**50**

Just as harsh words spoken by wicked men do not cause a tremor in a controlled man, so too, the showers of arrows released by the Rakshasas did not cause any tremor in Hanumana.  In other words, the valiant Hanumana was not shaken by the Rakshasas' arrows.

**51**

Seeing Hanumana surrounded by many Rakshasas, these warriors of the Vanara army prepared for battle.

**52-53**

Sushena, Nala, Nila, Pritikara, Viradhit, Santrasaka, Harikathi, Surya-Jyoti, Mahabala, and the son of Jambunada, all mounted on chariots drawn by lions, elephants, and horses, were ready to stop Ravana's army with great difficulty.

**54**

Just as a vow taken by a very insignificant person is destroyed by the wise, so too, Ravana's army was destroyed by the warriors of the Vanara army who were coming from all sides.

**55**

Seeing his people distressed and Ravana eager to fight, the mighty Bhanukarna (Kambhakarn) rose to fight.

**56**

Seeing the valiant Bhanukarna, who was blazing with the fire of battle, rise up, Sushena and others rushed to support him.

**57-58**

Chandra-Rashmi, Jaya-Skanda, Chandra-Abha, Rati-Vardhana, Anga, Angada, Sammedha, Kumuda, Chandra-Mandala, Bali, Chanda-Taranga, Sara, Ratna-Jati, Jaya, Bela-Akshepi, Vasanta, and Kolahala, etc.

**59**

These extremely powerful warriors of Rama's army were ready to engage in a great battle, a battle that was unbearable for the enemies.

In the Padma Purana, Kumbhakarna, filled with rage, then attacked the army. All of them were put to sleep by the Vidya called Nidra (sleep). ||6|| The eyes of those warriors, who were holding weapons, were heavy with sleep, and their weapons fell from their hands. ||61|| Seeing all of them unconscious due to sleep and their battle halted, Sugriva quickly invoked the Vidya called Prabodhini (awakening). ||62|| Awakened by that Vidya, their energy increased, and Hanuman and others, ready for battle, attacked the enemy with great force. ||63|| The army of the Vanaras, marked by their saffron robes, was very large, filled with chariots, swords, and weapons, and their desire for battle was insatiable. It seemed like a raging ocean. ||64|| Seeing the state of his army, which was in a sorry state, and the Vanara army, which was full of enthusiasm, Ravana, filled with excitement, bowed to Indrajeet, who was holding the Mahadeeptika (a powerful weapon), and said with folded hands: ||65-66|| "Father, father, it is not right for you to be eager for battle while I am alive. If that happens, my birth will be in vain. ||67|| What is the use of an axe to cut grass that can be cut with nails? Therefore, be at ease, I will fulfill your desire." ||68|| Saying this, Indrajeet, filled with joy, mounted his beloved elephant, Trailokya Kantak, which was like a mountain, and prepared for battle. He was accompanied by his ministers, and he was as wealthy as Indra, and a great warrior. ||69-70|| As soon as that mighty and proud Indrajeet rose, he swallowed the Vanara army, which was filled with various weapons, in an instant. ||71|| There was not a single Vanara in Sugriva's army who was not wounded by Indrajeet's arrows, which were sharp as needles. ||72|| At that time, people started saying: "Is this Indrajeet, or is this Indra himself? Or is this another Sun?" ||73||

Seeing his own army being overwhelmed, Sugreeva, along with Bhamandala, rose up to fight. ||74||

Then, a battle ensued between the two armies, filled with mutual challenges, the sky darkened by weapons, and life disregarded. ||75||

Horses clashed with horses, elephants with elephants, chariots with chariots, and foot soldiers with foot soldiers, all filled with great enthusiasm for their lord. ||76||

Indrajit, filled with pride, addressed Sugreeva, who stood before him, with a voice that touched the sky, a voice that was itself a weapon. ||77||

"O vile monkey, beastly and sinful! Having abandoned the command of Ravana, where do you go now, while I am enraged?" ||78||

"Today, with this arrow, black as the blue lotus, I will sever your head. May the earth-dwelling Rama and Lakshmana protect you!" ||79||

Sugreeva then replied, "What is the use of these empty roars? See, I will now break your pride, your crest of arrogance!" ||80||

Thus speaking, Indrajit, bearing the weight of anger, approached Sugreeva, his bow drawn in a wondrous manner. ||81||

He, who was served by the shadow of an umbrella like the moon, released a volley of arrows at the king of Kishkindha. ||82||

Sugreeva, skilled in self-defense, also released arrows, drawn to his ear, and filled with sound, towards Indrajit. ||83||

With that continuous stream of arrows, the entire sky became like another sky, filled with forms. ||84||

From one side, the valiant Meghavahana challenged Bhamandala, and from the other, King Viradhit called out to Vajranakra. ||85||

Gautama Swami said to Srenic, "O King! King Viradhit struck Vajranakra, the king, on his chest with a blazing discus, causing him to fall." ||86||

In return, Vajranakra, with great care, struck Viradhit on his chest with a discus. For, indeed, great shame arises from not returning a blow. ||87||

At that time, the discus, with its sparks born from the friction of the air, and the sparks of the fire, made the sky glow red. ||88||

Such were the words being spoken, "Is this not Indrajit? Is this not Indra? Or is this Agni Kumar, the god of fire? Or has another sun risen?" ||73||

After that, seeing his own army being overwhelmed by Indrajit, Sugreeva himself, along with Bhamandala, rose up to fight. ||74||

Then, a battle ensued between the two armies, filled with mutual challenges, the sky darkened by weapons, and life disregarded. ||75||

Horses clashed with horses, elephants with elephants, chariots with chariots, and foot soldiers with foot soldiers, all filled with great enthusiasm for their lord. ||76||

Indrajit, filled with pride, addressed Sugreeva, who stood before him, with a voice that touched the sky, a voice that was itself a weapon. ||77||

"O vile monkey, beastly and sinful! Having abandoned the command of Ravana, where do you go now, while I am enraged?" ||78||

In the Padma Purana, Suryanandan, the son of Lankanaath, was disarmed by Indrajit. However, he did not retreat from the battle, being a valiant warrior. ||89|| Indrajit then used his vajra to disarm Suryanandan's weapons. This is because the virtuous never face defeat. ||90|| 
Then, filled with anger, Indrajit quickly dismounted his elephant and mounted the chariot of lions, which illuminated the sky. ||91|| 
Indrajit, with his steady mind and mastery over various weapons, was ready for a magical battle. ||92|| 
He unleashed a Varuna weapon, roaring like a cloud, and shrouded Sugriva in darkness. ||93|| 
Sugriva retaliated with a wind arrow that pierced through Indrajit's banner and umbrella, rendering his Varuna weapon as insignificant as a tuft of cotton. ||94|| 
The valiant Meghavahana, the son of Mandodari, then used an Agni weapon to burn the bow of King Bhamandal. ||95|| 
The sparks from this bow ignited the bows of other archers, causing them to emit smoke, which filled the army with fear. ||96|| 
These bows had consumed the lives of many warriors, and it seemed as if they were suffering from indigestion. ||97|| 
Bhamandal, protecting his chakra-sena, quickly countered the Agni weapon with a Varuna weapon. ||98|| 
Then, Meghavahana, the son of Mandodari, a warrior of great strength and unwavering resolve, destroyed Bhamandal's chariot. ||99|| 
Meghavahana, skilled in the use of weapons, then unleashed a beautiful Tamas weapon, which enveloped Bhamandal's entire army in darkness. ||100|| 
Bhamandal, blinded by the darkness, could not distinguish his own elephant and earth from those of his enemies. He was enveloped in a thick darkness, as if he had fainted. ||101||

The son of Janaka, blinded by the son of Dasha-asya, was enveloped by serpent-arrows, which emitted clouds of poison. ||102||
His entire body was covered with these serpent-arrows, which shone with a brilliance like that of fire, and he fell to the earth, resembling a sandalwood tree. ||103||
In the same way, Indrajit, wielding the weapons of darkness and the serpent-noose, subdued Sugriva. ||104||
Then Vibhishana, the wise one, skilled in the use of weapons, folded his hands and addressed Rama and Lakshmana. ||105||
"O Padma, O Padma, O mighty warrior, O Lakshmana, O Lakshmana, behold, these directions are covered with the arrows of Indrajit. ||106||
The sky and the earth are filled with his continuous arrows, which are as terrifying as the serpents of doom. ||107||
Sugriva and Bhamandala, disarmed by the serpent-arrows, have been bound and thrown to the ground by the son of Maya. ||108||
O Lord, O Bhamandala, the most intelligent of the celestial beings, and O Sugriva, the valiant king, the lord of many celestial beings, know that our collective death is imminent. ||109-110||
For these two are the only remaining leaders of our side. ||110||
Behold, this army of celestial beings, leaderless, is fleeing in all ten directions. ||111||
See, there, Marut-nandana, having conquered Kumbhakarna in a great battle, has bound him with his own hands. ||112||
The valiant Hanuman, whose umbrella, banner, bow, and armor have been shattered by arrows, has been forcibly captured. ||113||
As long as Sugriva and Bhamandala remain fallen on the earth, it is unlikely that Ravana, the master of warfare, will be able to reach them quickly. ||114||
Therefore, I will go myself and bring back these two, who are now helpless. You, O Rama, protect this army of celestial beings, which is now leaderless. ||115||
While Vibhishana was speaking thus, the son of Sutara, unseen, went to his own side. ||116||

In the Padma Purana, the sun god released his garment, the sky. He became ashamed and confused, bewildered by the garment. ||117|| While the demon was busy fixing his garment, a wind emerged from his armpit. ||118|| Just as a newly captured bird is startled when it escapes from a cage, so too was Hanuman startled and filled with fierce energy when he escaped from the demon's armpit. ||119|| Then, filled with joy and satisfaction, the valiant Hanuman and Angada, seated on the top of the chariot, shone like gods. ||120|| Meanwhile, Angada's brother Anga and the son of Chandrodara, Viradhit, stood with Lakshmana to encourage the Vidyaadhara army. ||121|| Vibhishana went before Indrajit, the son of Mandodari. Seeing his uncle, he was filled with anxiety. ||122|| If one looks at it fairly, what is the difference between his father and him? Therefore, it is not good to stand before him. ||123|| Sugriva and Vibhishana are bound by the Naga-pasha and are undoubtedly destined for death. Therefore, it is right to leave this place now. ||124|| Thinking thus, Indrajit and Meghavahana, filled with the pride of victory, left the battlefield. ||125|| Seeing them disappear, Vibhishana, whose heart was filled with fear, whose body was adorned with the Trisula weapon, whose armor was intact, and whose eyes were restless, descended from his chariot and went to where Sugriva and Bhamandala lay motionless. There he saw their pitiable state, bound by the Naga-pasha. ||126-127||
Then the wise Lakshmana said to Rama, "O Lord! Listen, where those masters of the Vidyaadharas, Bhamandala and Sugriva, who are extremely powerful, accompanied by large armies, and endowed with great power, have been stripped of their weapons and bound by the Naga-pasha by the sons of Ravana, can Ravana be defeated by you or me?" ||128-130|| Then, remembering the auspicious occasion, Rama said to Lakshmana, "Brother! At that time, when the destroyer of the world, the destroyer of the family, the destroyer of the sages, was destroyed, 1. क्षरद्धरण- म. । 2. स्फूतावुरुमार्गणैः म. ।

Mahalocanadeva's throne trembled suddenly, even though he was in a state of bliss, just by remembering that. ||132||
Knowing this through his all-seeing eyes, he immediately sent his own चिन्तावेग (Chintavega) with two विद्या (Vidya)s. ||133||
Going there, the देव (deva) who had delivered the message of well-being with respect, gave two excellent विद्या (Vidya)s to Rama and Lakshmana, along with their families. ||134||
For Rama, he gave the wondrous विद्या (Vidya) of the lion-chariot, and for Lakshmana, the Garuda-chariot विद्या (Vidya) that illuminated the directions. ||135||
Receiving the विद्या (Vidya)s, the valiant Rama and Lakshmana honored the चिन्तागति (Chintagaati) deva, inquired about his well-being, and then performed the highest worship of the Jina. ||136||
Eager to receive the excellent qualities, Rama and Lakshmana praised the excellent grace of Garuda, which they had received at the right time, with great joy. ||137||
At that time, Rama and Lakshmana saw thousands of shining divine weapons, such as the Varuna, Agni, and Marut weapons, standing before them, meaning the deva had given them all those weapons. ||138||
The deva also gave them umbrellas like the moon and sun, adorned with beautiful चामर (chamar)s, and many jewels covered in their own brilliance. ||139||
Lakshmana received the mace called विद्युद्वक्त्र (Vidyuvaktara), and Rama received the हल (hala) and मुसल (musala) weapons, which caused fear to the demons. ||140||
Thus, the deva, having attained supreme glory, met with Rama and Lakshmana with joy, gave them hundreds of blessings, and then went to his own abode. ||141||
Gautama Swami tells King Shrenika, "O King! Wise people should know that the fruit of righteous conduct, performed according to the rules, is blameless, praiseworthy, and has unparalleled results, which are obtained at the right time. By obtaining this fruit, people become filled with joy, their misfortunes are removed from afar, and they become endowed with great power, capable of doing good for themselves and others." ||142||
Remember the boon we received. ||131||

The sixty-first chapter:

In the meantime, the two divine figures, adorned with divine armor, bearing the marks of Lakshmi and Srivatsa, and enveloped in a halo of brilliance, mounted on their respective vehicles, the lion and the Garuda, were moving through the midst of the celestial sphere. [1]

They were both exceedingly handsome, riding on their vehicles, the lion and the Garuda, and were stationed in the midst of the ocean of armies, their banners bearing the insignia of the lion and the Garuda. [2]

They were both determined to destroy the enemy forces, and were both filled with intense energy, as they stood in the midst of the battlefield. [3]

Lakshmana, the beloved of his friends, moved forward with great speed, his divine umbrella scattering the rays of the sun. [4]

He was surrounded by the foremost of the monkey warriors, led by Sugriva, and was adorned with a divine form that was impossible to describe. [5]

As Lakshmana moved forward, Vibhishana, the bearer of wondrous brilliance, saw that the world was ablaze with the light of twelve suns rising simultaneously. [6]

As Lakshmana approached, the dense, dark weapon of the enemy was swallowed up by the brilliance of the Garuda, and disappeared into the unknown. [7]

The wind from the wings of the Garuda stirred up the waters of the salt sea, and all the serpents were destroyed, just as evil thoughts are destroyed by the virtuous. [8]

The world seemed to be made of molten gold, as the rays of light emanating from the wings of the Garuda illuminated everything. [9]

Then, the two lords of the celestial beings, Sugriva and Bhammandala, whose bonds with the serpents had been broken, regained their composure. [10]

They had slept soundly, wrapped in silken blankets adorned with jewels, their bodies marked with the lines of the serpent-like vines, and were now more beautiful than ever before. Their breathing was now clear, and they rose from their sleep, just as men who have slept soundly rise when their sleep is over. [11-12]

Then, the celestial beings, led by Suketo, Duruma, and Swachcha, were filled with wonder, and asked the two kings, who had been worshipped by them: [13]

"O lords, we have never seen such a calamity befall you before. What is this extraordinary power that has come upon you? Tell us." [14]

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that the divine wealth of vehicles, weapons, umbrellas, supreme radiance, flags, and various kinds of jewels were obtained by them. ||15|| Then Rama said to them, "Once, on the front part of the Vansasthavil mountain, the country-adorning and lineage-adorning sages were afflicted, so I went there." ||16|| "I removed the affliction, and at that time, both the sage kings attained perfect knowledge, became four-faced, and were established. Divine miracles arose, the arrival of the gods occurred, Garuda, the king of birds, was pleased with us, and we obtained our home. At that time, by meditating on Garuda, we obtained these great knowledge." ||17-18|| Then, those Vidyaadhara kings, who were attentive, having heard the excellent story of the sages, and who were attaining supreme joy, with their lotus-like faces blooming, said, ||19|| "By the influence of the service of the virtuous, performed with devotion, a man obtains in this very world, great and excellent fame, sharpness of intellect, noble conduct, and pure merit." ||20|| "Neither a mother, nor a father, nor a friend, nor a brother, does the good of men as the virtuous do, by implanting in them the highest wisdom in Dharma, for their ultimate good and auspicious rise." ||21|| Thus, those kings, who had dedicated their feelings for a long time, and who were filled with wonder at the progress of the Jina path, were adorned by the shelter of Rama and Lakshmana, who were endowed with great splendor. ||22|| Hearing this story, which was like the playful roar of a lion, and which was the cause of a great festival of beautiful lotus-like beings, all of them attained the ocean of great joy, and were filled with supreme delight. Those two, with lotus-like eyes that had abandoned sleep, having attained the worship of the gods, were worshipped by the Vidyaadhara kings, who were like the gods, with their whole being. ||23||

Sixty-first Parva
387
The lineage of the virtuous, having accumulated merit in past lives, engages in the highest festivities in this life. Not only for themselves, but also for others, just as the sun, by illuminating all objects, brings about their glory. ||24||
Thus ends the sixty-first Parva of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, entitled "The Assurance of Sugriva and Bhammandala." ||6||
The celestial beings, like all the Vidhyadhara kings, who were immersed in the ocean of great joy, having heard the pure story, and who were adorned with eyes like blooming lotuses, worshipped Rama and Lakshmana in every way. ||23||
Gautama Swami says that a man who accumulates merit in past lives, in this world, not only enjoys the highest festivities for himself, but also, like the sun, by illuminating all objects, brings about the great prosperity of others. That is to say, a virtuous man attains prosperity for himself and also brings prosperity to others. ||24||
Thus ends the sixty-first Parva of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, entitled "The Assurance of Sugriva and Bhammandala," which describes the assurance obtained by Sugriva and Bhammandala, bound by the serpent's noose. ||6||

Then on the second day, those who were born with great prowess, who were skilled in the art of war, and who had gathered all the necessary supplies for battle, those valiant warriors, ready for war, emerged. ||1|| Seeing the sky constantly filled with the monkey army, and hearing the sound of conch shells and drums mixed with the roar of elephants and horses, the valiant Ravana, who could lift Kailasa, also emerged with his brothers and others! Ravana was endowed with immense strength and intelligence, he was proud, respectful, radiant like the gods, possessed of courage and valor, surrounded by an ocean of soldiers, and his weapons seemed to set the world ablaze with their brilliance. ||2-4|| Then those who had donned their armor, who were filled with an intense desire for battle, who were mounted on various vehicles, who were armed with various kinds of powerful weapons, and who seemed like great storms due to their pre-determined anger, those valiant warriors engaged in mutual slaughter. ||5-6|| The sky was filled with weapons like discs, swords, ropes, axes, staffs, thunderbolts, maces, clubs, gold, and maces. ||7|| The group of horses joined with the horses, the group of elephants faced the group of elephants, and the valiant charioteers stood with the charioteers. ||8|| The lion riders joined with the lion riders, and the agile and equally valiant foot soldiers joined with the foot soldiers, ready for a great battle. ||9|| Then, at first, the demon warriors defeated the monkey army, but then, Neel and other monkeys restored its ability to shower weapons, meaning the monkey army retreated initially, but as soon as Neel and other monkeys came forward, they started showering weapons on the demons again. ||10|| After seeing the defeat of their army, the following kings of Lanka, who were as restless as the waves of the ocean, again prepared for battle. ||11||  Vidyudev, Maricha, Chandra, Arka, Shuka, 1.

Papouraana
Hearing Vibhishana's words, Ravana, filled with youthful anger, strung his bow and ran towards him. ||28||
Mounted on chariots, horses, and elephants, those who were devoted to their lord, other kings also joined the battle, which was terrifying and filled with the sound of clashing weapons. ||29||
Then, with great speed, Vibhishana went towards the Rakshasa king and cut his flag with an arrow that curved like the eighth-day moon. ||30||
Ravana, whose mind was filled with the burden of anger, broke Vibhishana's bow in two with a sharp-pointed arrow. ||31||
Then, Vibhishana, skilled in counter-attacks, quickly picked up another bow and broke Ravana's bow in two. ||32||
Thus, as the great battle raged between them, causing the destruction of many heroes, Indrajit, the devoted son of Janaka, prepared to fight. ||33||
Just as a mountain holds back the ocean, Lakshmana stopped him, and Rama, with lotus-like eyes, faced Bhanukarna, thus beginning the battle. ||34||
Neela went against Singhakati (Lion-waist), Nal against Yuddha-Shambhu, Durmati against Swayambhu, Durmasa, filled with anger, against Kumbhodara, Dushta against Indravajra, Kanta against Chandranakha, Skanda against Bhinnaanjana, the king Viradhit against Vighna, Angada, the wearer of the shining keyura, against the famous Maha-daitya Maya, Hanuman against Kumbha, the son of Kumbhakarna, Sugriva against Sumali, Bhammandala against Ketu, Dridharatha against Kama, and Kshubdha against the powerful vassal Kshobhana. ||35-38||
Besides these, other great warriors, whose mouths were filled with the sound of battle cries, also engaged in battle according to their abilities. ||39||
At that time, the warriors were exchanging words like these: "Take it," "Strike," "Come," "Kill," "Kill him," "Pierce," "Break," "Throw," "Rise," "Sit," "Stand," "Tear," "Hold," "Bind," "Smash," "Drag," "Release," "Crush," "Leave," "Destroy," "Endure," "Give," "Retreat," "Make peace," "Rise," "Become strong." "Why are you afraid? I will not kill you. Shame on you, you coward! Who are you to be afraid? You are lost. Don't tremble. Where are you going?" ||40-42||
This powerful delusion is very difficult to overcome. ||27|| 

Page #409:

## Dvashashtitmam Pa

This is the time when the brave and the cowardly are tested.  Just as one does not fight in battle as one eats sweet food, so too, the brave do not fight in battle as they eat sweet food. ||43||

The directions seemed to be roaring with the roars of the brave and the elevated sounds of the trumpets, as if they were drunk with the blood and were shrouded in darkness. ||44||

The sky became extremely terrifying, as if it were holding its teeth to swallow everything, with weapons like the chakra, shakti, gada, ashti, kanaka, ashta, and ghana. ||45||

Seeing the army wounded and drenched in blood, one wondered if it was the red forest of Ashoka, or the grove of Palasha, or the forest of Paribhadra trees. ||46||

Seeing his armor broken and his bonds loosened, one quickly donned another armor, just as a virtuous person quickly dons love again after it is broken. ||47||

A valiant warrior, with his teeth clenched, held his sword firmly and, tightening his belt, was ready to fight again, free from fatigue. ||48||

Another warrior, whose chest was wounded by the tusk of a maddened elephant, was being honored with the waving fly whisks made from the elephant's ears. ||49||

One warrior, having fulfilled his duty to his master, with a calm mind, spread out his arms and slept between the elephant's tusks. ||50||

Many warriors, who looked like mountains of iron and from whom streams of blood were flowing, were revived from their swoon by the sprinkling of water drops. ||51||

Many warriors, with their lips bitten, weapons in hand, and with furrowed brows and fierce faces, were giving up their lives, lying on the ground. ||52||

Some brave warriors, having restrained their anger and discarded their weapons, were giving up their lives, meditating on the Supreme Word. ||53||

Some fierce warriors, holding the tips of their tusks in their hands, were swinging in front of the elephants. ||54||

Hundreds of headless bodies, with their weapons in hand, were dancing a terrifying dance, shedding blood. ||55||

Some, with their armor shattered, were entering the water, exhausted and with their hopes of life fading. ||56||

Shame on you, why are you trembling? Have you forgotten? Don't tremble, where will you go alone? ||41-42||

Padma Purana
Thus, many warriors, filled with sorrow, turned away from the hope of life, abandoned their weapons and plunged into the water. ||56||
In this way, when the great battle, a destroyer of the world, was taking place, causing the destruction of great warriors, Indrajeet was engaged in covering Lakshmana with sharp arrows, and Lakshmana was engaged in covering Indrajeet. ||57-58||
Indrajeet released a very fearsome weapon called Maha-tamas, which Lakshmana destroyed with the Surya-astra. ||59||
Thereafter, filled with anger, Indrajeet began to encircle Lakshmana with Naga arrows, along with his chariot, weapons, and vehicle. Then Lakshmana, using the Garuda-astra, dispelled that Naga-astra, just as a great ascetic yogi dispels a collection of past sins. ||60-61||
Thereafter, Lakshmana, while standing amidst the group of ministers and surrounded by a group of elephants, rendered Indrajeet chariotless. ||62||
Then, protecting his army with words and actions, Indrajeet released a Tamas-astra that enveloped Ravana in great darkness. ||63||
In return, Lakshmana, releasing the Surya-astra, destroyed Indrajeet's desire and released Naga arrows that could assume any form at will. ||64||
As a result, Indrajeet, while approaching the battle, was enveloped by Nagas all over his body, and just as the Bhamandala had fallen to the earth before, he too fell to the earth. ||65||
On the other hand, Rama, having destroyed the Surya-astra with a thunderbolt and using the Naga-astra, rendered Bhanukarna chariotless in battle. ||66||
Just as the mighty Bahubali, having conquered the son of Nami, Srikantha, bound him with a Naga-paasha, so too Rama, having enveloped Bhanukarna with Naga-paasha on all sides, caused him to fall to the earth. ||67||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! Those arrows were very strange. When they were placed on the bow, they remained in the form of arrows, when they moved, they became like the face of a meteor, and when they reached the body, they became like Nagas. ||68||
Those arrows were arrows for a moment, they became like a staff for a moment, and they became like a Naga-paasha for a moment. In reality, these were all varieties of weapons, divinely inspired, and capable of assuming any form at will." ||69||
The Acharya says, "Just as a worldly being is bound by the karma-paasha, so too was he bound by the Naga-paasha. Having attained the Padma-jnana, he was placed in his own chariot." ||70||

## Dwadashatitam Parva 393

**71.** Though he was the son of Mandodari, he was bound by the command of Narayana.  Kantavigraha was placed in his chariot by Viradhit.

**72.**  For a long time, the ten-headed one, filled with pride, taunted Vibhishana in the midst of the battle.

**73.**  "If you consider yourself a true warrior, a fierce one who thrives in the heat of battle, then accept this single blow from me."

**74.**  Having said this, he hurled a trident, its surface ablaze with sparks, which enveloped the sky.  But Lakshmana, in the meantime, destroyed it with his arrows.

**75.**  Seeing that extremely powerful weapon, the trident, reduced to ashes, Ravana, filled with even greater rage, took up a terrible Shakti.

**76.**  As he looked ahead, he saw Lakshmana, standing there, radiant, dark as a young blue lotus, and resplendent like the Supreme Lord.

**77.**  Seeing Lakshmana, Ravana, whose voice boomed like the gathering clouds of a deluge, spoke, as if striking him, saying:

**78.**  "What right do you have to stand near me when I have raised my weapon to kill another?"

**79.**  "Or, you foolish Lakshmana, if you desire death, then stand firm, you with your handsome form, and accept this blow from me."

**80.**  Hearing this, Lakshmana, with great difficulty, pushed Vibhishana aside and rushed towards Ravana, who had been weary from fighting for a long time.

**81.**  Then, Ravana, filled with the weight of anger, hurled a Shakti, from which a cluster of sparks flew like stars.  This Shakti, whose aim was never in vain, and which was extremely powerful, shattered Lakshmana's chest, which was like the bank of a great mountain.

**82.**  That radiant Shakti, which struck Lakshmana's chest, adorned with its beautiful form, resembled a woman clinging to her beloved with utmost love.

**83.**  Lakshmana, pained by the force of the blow, fell to the ground, like a mountain struck by a thunderbolt. 

Page #412:

Seeing him fallen to the ground, Padma-lochan Rama, suppressing his grief, was eager to kill the enemy. ||45|| Mounted on a chariot drawn by lions, filled with anger, the mighty Rama made the enemy chariotless as soon as he approached. ||86|| As soon as he mounted another chariot, Rama broke the bow of the enemy. And as soon as he took another bow, Rama made him chariotless again. ||87|| Ravana, struck by the arrows of Padma-lochan, was so bewildered that he was unable to grasp either an arrow or a bow. ||88|| Though struck by sharp arrows and lying on the ground, Ravana, filled with grief, was seen again on another chariot. ||89|| Though his bow was broken and his armor was pierced, and though he was made chariotless six times, the wondrous Ravana could not be defeated. ||90|| Then, filled with wonder, Padma-lochan said to him, "You are not short-lived, for you have not yet attained the five states of existence." ||91|| "I think that even mountains would crumble under the force of the swift, sharp-pointed arrows released from my arms. What then of others?" ||92|| "Yet, you are protected by the merit accumulated in past lives. Listen, O King of the celestial beings, I will tell you something." ||93|| "My brother, who was facing you in battle, has been wounded by your power and is now facing death. If you permit, I would like to see his face." ||94|| Saying, "So be it," Ravana, who was poor in fulfilling requests and whose splendor was like that of Indra, went towards Lanka with his wealth and retinue. ||95|| "This great enemy has been slain by me," thinking thus, Ravana, having gained some courage, entered his palace. ||96|| Ravana, who was affectionate towards valiant men, searched for the wounded warriors and looked at them with love, thus dispelling their grief, and entered the inner palace. ||97|| Hearing that his brother Kumbhakarna, and his sons Indrajit and Meghavahana, were staying with the enemy, Ravana was filled with grief, but seeing his loved ones, he...

This is the inevitable outcome of the accumulated karma from past lives, which manifests in various forms in one's present life. Here, those who are endowed with abundant virtues, constantly engage in various types of actions, and experience their fruits accordingly. ||99||

Some, due to the dictates of destiny, face destruction in this world, while others, valiant and victorious over their enemies, attain their desired position. Some, with their vast powers rendered futile, find themselves bound, while others, like the sun, excel in illuminating worthy objects. ||100||

Thus ends the sixty-second chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the sorrow of Lakshmana's affliction. ||62||

1. Then, the Trishatitam festival arrived, and Padma, overwhelmed with grief, was struck by sorrow. He reached the place where Lakshmana lay.
2. Seeing Lakshmana, the ornament of the earth, motionless, his chest embraced by Shakti, Padma fainted.
3. After regaining consciousness after a long time, he was filled with great sorrow and lamented, consumed by the fire of grief.
4. "Alas, my dear son! You have crossed this difficult ocean of karma, and now you have reached this extremely painful state."
5. "Oh, my son! You were always devoted to my devotion and always eager to serve me. Therefore, quickly give me your word, speak to me, why are you sitting in silence?"
6. "You know that I cannot bear your separation even for a moment. Get up, embrace me, where has your respect gone?"
7. "Today, my long arms, adorned with armlets, have become mere namesakes, completely useless and inactive without you."
8. "My parents and teachers entrusted you to me with great effort. Now, ashamed, what answer will I give them?"
9. "Everyone, filled with love, will ask me with great curiosity, 'Where is Lakshmana? Where is Lakshmana?'"
10. "You were like a jewel among valiant men. By defeating you, I consider myself a man without valor, my life destroyed."
11. "This is the fruit I have received for the evil deeds I committed in past lives. What use do I have for Sita, my brother?"
12. "I see you lying on the earth, my heart hardened, my chest pierced by Shakti, wielded by the merciless Ravana, for whose sake?"
13. "In this world, desires, wealth, and various relationships are easily available to men."

## Trishatittama Parva 397

**15.** O Sugriva, King of the Kechara, you have shown your friendship. Now, go to your own country. Similarly, O Bhamandala, you too go to your own country.

**16.** There is no doubt that I will enter the fire tomorrow with my brother, abandoning the hope of life, like Janaki.

**17.** O Vibhishana, the sorrow arising from the separation of Sita and my younger brother does not pain me as much as the fact that I could not do anything for you.

**18.** Noble people help before and after the deed, while mediocre people help only after the deed. But those who do not help even after the deed are considered to be low-born and wicked.

**19.** O Vibhishana, you are a noble person. You helped me before and opposed my brother after. Still, I could not do anything for you, and this burns me from within.

**20.** O Bhamandala and Sugriva, quickly build a pyre. I will go to the other world. You both do what is right for yourselves.

**21.** Then, Jambunada, the great and wise, stopped Rama from touching Lakshmana, who was eager to touch him.

**22.** He said, "O Lord, do not touch Lakshmana, who is unconscious due to the divine weapon. Such actions often lead to carelessness. This is the nature of these divine weapons."

**23.** "Embrace courage and abandon fear. In this world, there are often remedies for those who are in distress."

**24.** "Wailing is not a remedy for noble people. Let your mind be filled with courage and act according to the truth."

**25.** "O Lord, there will surely be some remedy. Your brother will live, for he is Narayana, and Narayana does not die untimely."

**26.** Then, all the Vidhyadhara kings, filled with sorrow, started thinking of a remedy, pondering within themselves.

**27.** "This divine power cannot be overcome by medicines. Lakshmana will barely survive if the sun rises. If a remedy is not found before sunrise, it will be difficult for him to survive."

**28.** Then, the servants, in half a twinkling of an eye, removed the headless torso and other things, purifying the battlefield. They erected high tents, curtains, and pavilions made of cloth. 

Page #416:
---------------------------
The land was fortified with seven enclosures, with entrances sealed off and guarded by warriors clad in armor and wielding bows.  

**29.**  At the first gate stood Neel, bow in hand.  At the second, Nal, wielding a mace, stood like a cloud.

**30.**  At the third, Vibhishana, holding a trident, stood tall and generous.  He was adorned with garlands of jewels, his radiance like that of the Lord Shiva.

**31.**  Kumuda stood at the fourth gate, armed with a quiver and arrows.  At the fifth, the valiant Sushena stood, spear in hand.

**32.**  Sugriva, with his massive arms and wielding the weapon called Bindumala, stood like Indra himself at the sixth gate.

**33.**  At the seventh gate stood Bhamandala, the slayer of great kings, his sword drawn, guarding the perimeter.

**34.**  At the eastern gate stood Sharabha, his banner marked with the symbol of a Sharabha.  At the western gate stood Jambavan, the prince.

**35.**  At the northern gate, surrounded by a throng of ministers, stood Chandramarichi, the powerful son of Bali.

**36.**  Thus, the land, created by the efforts of the Vidhyadhara kings, shone brightly, like the sky adorned with a multitude of pure stars.

**37.**  Those other Vidhyadhara kings who did not return from the battle stood, their banners spread, covering the southern direction.

**38.**  Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! Those who had made such efforts, who had guarded so diligently, who doubted Lakshmana's survival, who were filled with wonder and grief, and who had accepted the truth, all those Vidhyadhara kings stood in their places."

**39.**  Neither men, nor horses, nor elephants, nor even the gods can prevent the fruit of the sun of karma, which is born from the self, from shining upon mankind.

**40.**  Thus ends the sixty-third chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "Shaktibheda and Ramavilapa," narrated by the sage Ravipeena.

## Chapter Forty-Six

Knowing that Lakshmana's death was certain, Ravana, deeply pained by the thought of killing his son and brother, was filled with immense sorrow. 

**1.** "Alas, brother! You were so generous and always dedicated to my well-being. How did you come to this unjust state of captivity?"

**2.** "Alas, my sons! You were so powerful, strong as my own arms. It is only by fate's decree that you have been subjected to this new bondage."

**3.** "What will the enemy do to you? My mind is filled with anxiety. I, the sinful one, do not know his intentions, or perhaps he will do something terrible, something that will bring harm to you."

**4.** "You, the best of men, worthy of love, have been subjected to the pain of captivity. I am deeply distressed. Why is this suffering mine?"

**5.** Like a mighty elephant whose herd has been captured, Ravana, consumed by silent grief, continued to mourn.

**6.** Hearing that Lakshmana, the bearer of fortune, had fallen to the ground, struck by the weapon, Sita was overcome with sorrow and began to lament.

**7.** "Alas, dear Lakshmana! Alas, the gentle one! Alas, adorned with virtues! You have come to this state for me, the unfortunate one."

**8.** "Even though I am in this predicament, I long to see you. But I, the sinful one, am unable to see you."

**9.** "I have no doubt that the wicked enemy, who killed a hero like you, can kill anyone. If he could kill a hero like you, he can kill anyone."

**10.** "You, who were always concerned for your brother's well-being, were first separated from your loved ones, and now, after crossing the ocean with great difficulty, you have come to this state."

**11.** "Will I ever again see the one who was skilled in games, the one who was humble, the one who spoke beautiful words, the one who performed extraordinary feats?" 

Page #418:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
13. May the gods protect your life in every way. May you quickly become free from the arrow and be the delight of all the worlds.
14. Thus, the sorrowful Janaka's daughter, Sita, was comforted by the loving Khecharis.
15. "O Devi, the certainty of your brother-in-law is not yet known. Therefore, there is no reason for you to grieve."
16. "Be patient, for this is the way of the brave. There are always retributions, for the workings of the world are indeed strange."
17. Hearing these words of the Vidyadharis, Sita was somewhat relieved. Now listen to what happened in this Lakshmana Parva.
18. "A handsome man has come to the door of the camp. He is entering. "
19. "Who are you? Whose man are you? Where do you come from? And why do you wish to enter? Stay, stay, tell us everything. The entry of unknown people is forbidden here."
20. "It has been more than a month since I arrived here. I wish to see Rama, but I have not yet had the opportunity."
21. "I am here to see him now. If you wish to see Lakshmana alive soon, I will tell you how."
22. Upon hearing this, the king of the Bhamandala was very pleased. He sent his representative to the door and brought the man to Rama.
23. The man bowed respectfully to Rama and said, "O Maharaj, do not be distressed. The prince is certainly alive."
24. "My mother's name is Suprabha and my father's name is Chandramandala. I am from Devagitapur and my name is Chandrapratima."
25. "Once, while I was flying through the sky, I was seen by Sahasravijaya, the son of King Veladhyaksha, who is our enemy."
26. "Then, remembering the enmity over women, he became enraged. A fierce battle ensued between us."

Chapter Forty-Six

401. Then I was struck by the power of Chandarava. I fell from the sky into the dense Mahendrodaya forest of Ayodhya at night. ||27||

Seeing me falling like a star, the king of Saketa, Bharata, came near me. ||28||

His chest was pierced by the weapon, and he was drenched in sandalwood water. Seeing me, that compassionate and virtuous man, ||29||

The weapon fled somewhere, and my form returned to its former state. I gained great happiness from that fragrant water. ||30||

That great soul, Bharata, the king of men, gave me this rebirth, the fruit of which is your sight. ||31||

Meanwhile, Rama, the beautiful son of Raghu, filled with joy, asked him, "Bhadra, do you know the origin of that fragrant water?" ||32||

He said, "O Dev, I know. Listen, I will tell you. I asked King Bharata, and he told me this." ||33||

"This entire country, including cities and villages, was afflicted by many incurable diseases." ||34||

"There were chest pains, severe fever, excessive salivation, pain all over the body, loss of appetite, vomiting, swelling, and boils. All these diseases were raging like angry demons. There was not a single creature in this land who was not afflicted by them." ||35-36||

"Only Drona Megha, the king, along with his ministers, animals, and relatives, was healthy like a god in his own city. I heard this." ||37||

"I called him and said, 'O Mam, just as you are healthy, you are capable of making me healthy immediately.'" ||38||

Then he called for the water that filled the sky with its fragrance and sprinkled it on me. I attained complete health. ||39|| 

Page #420:
---------------------------
402
In the Padma Purana, not only did I become free from disease by that water, but also my inner palace, city, and entire country became free from disease. ||40|| The air, which was unbearable and the cause of thousands of diseases, and was skilled in piercing the vital points, was destroyed by that water. ||41|| I repeatedly asked King Drona Megha, "O King! From where did you obtain this water, which has brought about this wonder of the destruction of diseases?" ||42|| He replied, "O King! Listen, I have a daughter named Vishalya, who is adorned with virtues and is skilled in all kinds of knowledge." ||43|| When she was in my wife's womb, my wife, who was afflicted with many diseases, became free from all diseases and became a benefactor to me. ||44|| She is devoted to the teachings of the Jinas, is always engaged in worship, is beautiful, and is worthy of worship by all, like the remaining part of the body. ||45|| This water, which is full of a great fragrance, is her bath water, which instantly destroys all diseases. ||46|| Having heard these words of Drona Megha, I was filled with wonder and worshipped his daughter with great pomp. ||47|| When I was returning from the city, I met a sage named Satya Hita, who was the head of the assembly of sages. I bowed to him with humility and asked him about Vishalya's character. ||48|| King Bharata said to the celestial being, "O celestial being! After I asked, the sage, who was a possessor of four kinds of knowledge and a great friend, told me the divine character of Vishalya as follows: ||49|| In the Videha region, there is a country called Pundarika, which is like heaven. In its city called Chakradhara, there lived a universal monarch named Tribhunanananda. ||50|| He had a daughter named Anangasara, who was adorned with virtues, was a unique creation of karma, and was a flowing stream of beauty. ||51|| The king, Tribhunanananda, had a vassal named Punarvasu, who was the lord of the city of Pratiṣṭhapura. Driven by lust, he abducted the girl by putting her on an airplane. ||52|| Having received the order of the angry Chakradhara, his servants pursued him and fought for a long time, completely destroying his airplane. ||53|| When his airplane was being destroyed, he, with a troubled mind, fell from it like the moon's light in autumn. ||54||

With the knowledge called Parnalavya, bestowed upon her by Punarvasu, she descended from the sky, and arrived at the forest called Shvapada. ||55||

This forest, even for the great Vidyaadharas, was difficult to enter, filled with dense darkness, with huge trees entangled in various creepers, and the sun's rays, frightened by the dense shade of the leaves, seemed to have abandoned it. It was inhabited by wolves, Sharabha, cheetahs, leopards, lions, and other wild animals. The terrain was uneven, with deep burrows, and it was a place of great fear. Entering this great forest, she was overcome with great fear, and like the flame of a lamp, she trembled. ||56-59||

Reaching the bank of a river, she looked in all directions, filled with great sorrow, and wept, remembering her family. ||60||

She said, "Alas, I was born of the great king, the protector of the world, who shines like Indra, and who is a great wheel-turner. I was nurtured with great love. Today, by the will of fate, I have been brought to this state. Alas, I have come to this forest, which is difficult even to look at. What shall I do?" ||61-62||

"Alas, Father! You are a great warrior, and you protect all the worlds. Why do you not have mercy on me, who am helpless in the forest?" ||63||

"Alas, Mother! You endured the pain of carrying me in your womb. Why do you not have mercy on me now?" ||64||

"Alas, my dear ones, who are like the shadow of my heart, and who are full of good qualities! You have never left me for even a moment. Why are you leaving me now?" ||65||

"I am not dead, I am just born. Why am I destined for this suffering? Or is it that without good deeds, one cannot obtain what one desires?" ||66||

"What shall I do? Where shall I go? Whose shelter shall I seek? Whom shall I see? How shall I live in this great forest, being a sinner?" ||67||

"Is this a dream? Or have I been born in hell? Am I the same, or is this some new state that has suddenly appeared?" ||68||

Thus, she lamented for a long time, and became completely distraught. Her lamentations melted even the hearts of the cruel animals. ||69||

In the Padma Purana, Anangaseena, whose body was scorched by hunger and thirst, and who was constantly immersed in the ocean of sorrow, her mind utterly dejected, sustained herself on fruits and leaves. (70) The winter, which robbed the lotus groves of their beauty, came upon her, and she endured it, for it was the consequence of her actions. (71) The herds of animals breathed heavily, many trees withered, and her body became extremely rough. She endured the scorching sun of summer in the same way. (72) The monsoon season, with its flashing lightning, darkness caused by the cool showers, and rising rivers, she also endured as best she could. (73) Her body, devoid of luster, torn, thin, with scattered hair and covered in dirt, was like a faded painting after the rain. (74) Just as the waning moon loses its brilliance in the sunlight, so too did her weak body become devoid of beauty. (75) She went to the forest of kapittha trees, their branches bent down with ripe, dusky-colored fruits, and remembering her father, she wept with sorrow. (76) "Born of a Chakravarti, I have come to this state in the forest. Surely, this is the result of my evil deeds in past lives." (77) With her face like a day of misfortune, her eyes cast down, tears flowing ceaselessly, she would pick up the fallen fruits and find peace. (78) Her body, emaciated by fasts, including the sixth, eighth, and others, she would sometimes break her fast with only water, and that too only once. (79) Anangaseena, who once felt sorrow even at the sight of fallen flowers on her bed, now lay on the bare ground. (80) She, who once awoke to the sound of her father's music, now awoke to the terrifying cries of jackals and other creatures. (81) Thus, enduring great suffering and breaking her fast with prasooka food, Anangaseena performed external austerities for three thousand years. (82) Then, filled with dispassion, she renounced all four types of food and, with a resolute mind, embraced Sallekhana. (83)

The Forty-sixth Chapter

84. She took the vow, as she had heard in the Jain scriptures before, that she would not go beyond a hundred cubits from the ground.

85. After six nights had passed, while she was observing the vow of Sallekhana, a man named Labhidās, who had worshipped Mount Meru, was returning. He saw the girl.

86. Then Labhidās, eager to take her to her father's house, was stopped by her, who said, "I have taken the vow of Sallekhana."

87. Labhidās quickly went to the Chakravarti and came back to the same place with him.

88. When he arrived, he saw a very large and fearsome serpent devouring her. He was determined to save her.

89. Seeing the daughter, who had taken the vow of Sallekhana, and who seemed like a different person due to her weakness, the Chakravarti became detached.

90. He renounced all desires, became filled with great detachment, and took the vows of a Shraman along with twenty-two thousand sons.

91. The girl, who had been devoured by the very large serpent that had come upon her due to hunger, died and went to the heaven of Ishana.

92. Even though she knew that she would die from the serpent, she did not move away out of compassion, so that it would not suffer even a little.

93. After defeating all the Vidyadharas in battle, Punarvasu was filled with sorrow because he could not see his beloved Anangashara. He was in the land of separation.

94. Finally, he took the vows of a Digambara Shraman in the presence of the Muni named Drumasen, and performed very difficult austerities, suffering greatly.

95. He died as a result of these austerities, and became a god in heaven. He was then born as Lakshmana, who was very beautiful.

96. Anangashara, who had been born in the heaven of the gods, was born as the daughter of King Drona-megha, named Vishalya.

97. Vishalya, who possessed great virtues, was born in this city, country, or Bharat region, due to the influence of her past actions.

98. She had performed great austerities in her previous life, including the vow of Sallekhana, which was accompanied by the following: 1. Being devoured by a serpent. 2. And then... 3. Facing death.

In the Padma Purana, it is said that this uneven wind, which is a carrier of great diseases, has been destroyed by this water in this country. It has been subdued and destroyed. ||19||

When asked why this wind became like this, the Muni said to the curious Bharat, ||10||

There was a very wealthy merchant named Vindhya who came from Gajahvana city with donkeys, camels, buffaloes, and other animals loaded. He stayed in your Ayodhya city for eleven months. One of his buffaloes, afflicted by a severe disease, died in the middle of the city and became a Dev due to the yoga of Akam Nirjara. ||101-103||

That Mahabala, the son of the wind, marked with the sign of a horse, was born as a Dev. His name was Vavavarta, he was the lord of the wind Devas, the lord of Shreyaskarpur city, residing in Rasatal, brilliant, cruel, and capable of performing actions according to his will. He was a great Bhavanvasi Dev. ||104-105||

Being endowed with Avadhigyan, he knew the defeat he had suffered in his previous birth. He knew that I was a buffalo before and had come to Ayodhya and stayed there. At that time, my body was covered with many wounds. My body was afflicted by hunger, thirst, etc., and I was suffering from many diseases. I was lying in the mud of the road, people were beating me. At that time, I was lying motionless, covered with dung and other filth, and all the people were stepping on my head. ||106-108||

Now, if I do not quickly take revenge on him - if I do not take revenge on him - then my attainment of this great and noble Dev status will be in vain. ||109||

Thinking this way, he filled with anger and sent out a wind that caused various diseases in that country. ||110||

This same Dev was destroyed by the bath water of Vishalya in an instant. It is true that even among the powerful, there are those who are more powerful than them. ||111||

As the Sattvahit Muni told this story to King Bharat, and Bharat told it to me, so you should know it, Padma. ||112||

Therefore, its bath water is accompanied by great masses. ||98|| In this country, the uneven wind, which had ruled over all the people and was a producer of great diseases, has been destroyed by this water. ||99||

'Why did this wind become like this?' When asked this, the Muni said to Bharat, who was full of curiosity at that time, ||10||

There was a very wealthy merchant named Vindhya who came from Gajapur city with donkeys, camels, buffaloes, and other animals loaded. He stayed in your Ayodhya city for eleven months. One of his buffaloes, afflicted by a severe disease, died in the middle of the city and became a Dev due to the yoga of Akam Nirjara. ||101-103||

That Mahabala, the son of the wind, marked with the sign of a horse, was born as a Dev. His name was Vavavarta, he was the lord of the wind Devas, the lord of Shreyaskarpur city, residing in Rasatal, brilliant, cruel, and capable of performing actions according to his will. He was a great Bhavanvasi Dev. ||104-105||

Being endowed with Avadhigyan, he knew the defeat he had suffered in his previous birth. He knew that I was a buffalo before and had come to Ayodhya and stayed there. At that time, my body was covered with many wounds. My body was afflicted by hunger, thirst, etc., and I was suffering from many diseases. I was lying in the mud of the road, people were beating me. At that time, I was lying motionless, covered with dung and other filth, and all the people were stepping on my head. ||106-108||

Now, if I do not quickly take revenge on him - if I do not take revenge on him - then my attainment of this great and noble Dev status will be in vain. ||109||

Thinking this way, he filled with anger and sent out a wind that caused various diseases in that country. ||110||

This same Dev was destroyed by the bath water of Vishalya in an instant. It is true that even among the powerful, there are those who are more powerful than them. ||111||

As the Chandrapratima Vidyadhar, Ram says that this story was told by the Sattvahit Muni to King Bharat, and Bharat told it to me, so you should know it, Padma. ||112||

**407**  O Rama! I have told you. Therefore, make haste to bring the water for Vishlya's bath. There is no other way for Lakshmana to live. ||113||

Even those who are on the path of death, and whose demise is certain by all, for such great souls, a way to provide life is known through the rise of their virtuous deeds. ||114||

Oh! Those people are truly great and excellent, for whom, like the sun, a brilliant person reveals the true essence and shows the way out of calamity. ||115||

Thus ends the sixty-fourth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the *Aarsha*, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, which describes the previous birth of Vishlya. ||64||

The 56th chapter. Having heard the words of the celestial being, Raghava was extremely delighted. He honored him equally with the lords of the Vidyadharas, who were astonished. ||1|| Then, after a quick consultation, the sons of Anjana, Vibhishana, and Angada, set out for Ayodhya. ||2|| Then, merely by thinking about it, they arrived where the king, Bharata, the best of men, renowned for his glory, powerful, and endowed with virtues, was residing. ||3|| As Bharata was sleeping, they started playing a pleasant melody, thinking that he should not be disturbed by being suddenly awakened. ||4|| Then, hearing the divine music, which was captivating to the ears and mind, the king of Kosala gradually awoke. ||5|| The servants, who were standing at the door, informed him of the arrival of the celestial beings. They told him about the abduction of Sita and the fall of Lakshmana due to the use of his power. ||6|| Then, due to the intense grief that arose in a moment, King Bharata was filled with extreme anger. ||7|| He immediately ordered the great sound of the war drum to be played, which filled the entire Ayodhya with extreme anxiety. ||8|| People started saying, "What is happening in the royal palace? We hear a great, terrifying sound of commotion." ||9|| "Has the son of Ativirya, who is wicked and skilled in attacking, arrived in this dead of night?" ||10|| One warrior, leaving his beloved in his arms, prepared to put on his armor. Another, without armor, placed his hand on his sword. ||11|| A woman with deer-like eyes, holding a beautiful child in her arms, placed her hand on her breast and looked around in fear. ||12|| One woman, leaving her husband, lay down with sleepless eyes. Hearing the sound of the war drum, she was so frightened that she abandoned her jealousy and went to her sleeping husband, who was lying on one side of the bed. ||13||

## The Fifty-Sixth Chapter

409. A wealthy man, comparing himself to the king, said to his wife, "My dear, wake up! Why are you sleeping? This is not proper." 

14. A light, never seen before, is visible in the royal palace. Charioteers are ready, and these intoxicated elephants are gathered.

15. Wise men, always alert, should be cautious. Arise, arise, and protect your wealth with diligence.

16. Place these golden and silver pots, and chests of jewels and gems, inside the underground chamber.

17. Quickly close these inner chambers filled with silk garments and other things. Arrange the scattered goods properly.

18. Shatrughna, his eyes red with sleep, was alarmed. He quickly mounted the elephant, whose bells were ringing, and reached Bharata's palace. Shatrughna, accompanied by the best ministers, with weapons in their hands, was leaving behind the fragrance of Bakula flowers, his clothes fluttering. Other kings, also armed, clad in armor, and eager to serve the king, reached Bharata's palace.

19-21. The lord of Ayodhya, Bharata, giving orders to the kings, himself prepared for battle. Then, bowing to the sun and other celestial bodies, he said:

22. "O Lord, Lanka is far away. You are not capable of going there. The terrible ocean, with its roaring waves and conch shells, lies in between."

23. "What should I do?" The king asked. Then, all of them narrated the captivating story of Vishalya.

24. "O Lord, the bathwater of Drona-Megha's daughter destroys sin, is pure, and protects life. Quickly bring it."

25. "Grant us your grace. We will leave before the sun rises. Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies, is wounded by an arrow and is in pain."

26. Then Bharata said, "Why take the water? Drona-Megha's beautiful daughter will go there herself. Take her."

27. The sage has said that she will be his beloved. Indeed, she is the best jewel among women. Who else is worthy of her?"

28. The battle is raging.

In the Papuraana, he sent his own man to Dronaghana. He, being enraged, was ready to suppress pride. ||29|| His sons, who were endowed with great strength, became agitated and prepared for battle along with their ministers. ||30|| Then, Bharat's mother, Kekayi, went herself and, with great respect, persuaded him, and he gave his daughter to him. ||31|| That daughter, who illuminated the directions with her radiance, was seated by Bhamandala on the top of his swift-moving chariot. ||32|| Along with her, a thousand other beautiful daughters, born in royal families, were sent. ||33|| Then, in the blink of an eye, she reached the battlefield. All the celestial beings honored her with offerings and other rites. Then, surrounded by the daughters and with beautiful chowries waving gently and pleasantly, Vishalya descended from the chariot. ||35|| Seeing the horses standing at the gate and the intoxicated elephants, she advanced. Great men were eager to obey her commands, and her face was like a lotus. ||36|| As the auspicious Vishalya approached, Lakshmana experienced an amazing state of bliss. ||37|| Then, just as a wicked woman flees from her husband's house in fear, the power that adorned the circle of radiance departed from Lakshmana's chest. ||38|| That power, which emitted sparks and flames, was about to cross the sky, when the swift Hanuman jumped and caught her. ||39|| Then, transformed into the form of a divine woman, she joined her hands and spoke to Hanuman. At that time, she was frightened and trembling. ||40|| She said, "O Lord! Be pleased, release me, I have no fault. This is the deplorable state of servants like us." ||41|| I am the renowned Amogha Vijaya, the sister of Prajnapti, and I have been perfected by Ravana. ||42|| Earlier, on Mount Kailasa,

2.
Raising his arm, he played the divine and auspicious story of the Jina on the beautiful string of his arm, which was like a Veena. ||44||

I was obtained by the ten-headed one from the king of the elephants, Dharanendra. He gave me to Ravana, who was filled with great joy, as his seat trembled. ||45||

Although the lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, did not want me, he was forced to accept me by Dharanendra, who was very persuasive. ||46||

Indeed, Ravana is always hesitant to accept anything from anyone. ||43-46||

I, who am a holder of unbearable power, cannot be held by anyone in this world except for one, Vishalya, the beautiful one. ||47||

I can defeat even the most powerful gods, but this Vishalya has separated me from them, even though she is far away. ||48||

She can make the sun cold and the moon hot, because she performed such intense austerities in her previous birth. ||49||

In her previous birth, she subjected her body, which was as delicate as a Shirisha flower, to such austerities that they were difficult even for the sages. ||50||

I see the world as full of essence because of such austerities that are performed by beings. ||51||

This slender one, who is like the peak of Mount Meru, did not tremble even a little bit in the face of terrible rains, cold, and heat, and the unbearable strong winds. ||52||

Oh, how blessed is her form, how blessed is her patience, and how blessed is her mind, which is firm in Dharma. Other women cannot even contemplate the austerities she has performed. ||53||

According to the Jina-Chandras, such immense austerities are performed only by those who are destined to achieve victory in all three worlds. ||54||

Or, perhaps, this should not be considered a wonder, because what is more difficult than attaining liberation, which is achieved by her? ||55||

My actions are dependent on others, but she has conquered me with her austerities. O virtuous one, I am going to my own place. Please forgive my misconduct. ||56||

Having spoken thus, the knower of truth, Hanuman, left the power-deity, Vishalya, and stood among his army, performing wondrous deeds. ||57||

Padma Purana
Suta, you have described the daughter of Drona Megha, whose body was adorned with modesty. She bowed with folded hands, offering obeisance to the lotus feet of Rama. ||58||
She was praised by the words of the great ministers of the Vidyadharas. She was honored by other celestial beings and blessed with auspicious wishes. ||59||
Like Sachi beside Indra, she stood beside Lakshmana, a beautiful woman with auspicious qualities, obedient to her companions. ||60||
She was captivating, with eyes like those of a doe, and a face like the full moon. Her generous heart was inspired by great love. ||61||
She embraced her beloved, who was sleeping peacefully on the earth, and adorned him with the fragrant sandalwood, which was held in her delicate hands, making him look even more beautiful. ||62||
She also anointed Rama with sandalwood, her hands trembling slightly with shyness. ||63||
The other maidens, following the instructions of the king of the celestial beings, touched the bodies of the other Vidyadharas with the sandalwood held in Vishalya's hand. ||64||
The sandalwood, touched by Vishalya's hand, was then brought to Indrajeet and others, as per Rama's command. ||65||
Inhaling the cool sandalwood and applying it to their bodies with reverence, they attained supreme bliss. Their souls were purified, and their fever vanished. ||66||
Other warriors, whose bodies were wounded, as well as elephants, horses, and foot soldiers, were sprinkled with that water. They became free from wounds, their bodies shining like the newly risen sun. ||67||
Lakshmana, who was as beautiful as if he had been born again, and who seemed to be enjoying a natural sleep, was awakened by the sweet melody of music, accompanied by the sound of the flute. ||68||
Then, with his chest heaving slowly, he opened his lotus-like red eyes, his arms outstretched. He contracted his limbs and abandoned the bed of delusion. ||69||

'Like a god abandoning the stone of the sacrificial altar, he, Lakshmana, abandoned the battlefield. Rising up, enraged, he looked around and asked, "Where has that Ravana gone?"' ||70||
Then, with his lotus-like eyes blooming, and his heart filled with great joy, Rama, the elder brother, embraced Lakshmana, whose body was trembling with excitement and whose arms were shining. He said, "My dear brother, that Ravana, having killed you, has gone away, having achieved his purpose. You too, through the virtue of this noble maiden, have attained rebirth." ||71-72||
Then, filled with wonder, Jambavan and others narrated the entire story to Lakshmana, from the moment the weapon was hurled, and expressed their amazement at the noble spirit of the event. ||73||
Then, Lakshmana saw a maiden whose eyes were adorned with three colors, whose face was like the full moon of autumn, whose belly was slender, whose breasts were like the cheeks of an elephant, who was in the prime of youth, who was like the plaything of Kamadeva himself, who had a large and graceful behind, and who was created by the karma of all the worlds. ||74-75||
Seeing her standing near him, Lakshmana, with his mind filled with wonder, thought, "Is this the Lakshmi of Indra? Or is this the radiance of the moon? Or is this the brilliance of the sun?" ||76||
Seeing Lakshmana thinking thus, the women, skilled in auspicious rites, said to him, "My lord, all the people gathered here wish to see your wedding with her." ||77||
Smiling, Lakshmana said, "This is indeed appropriate. But how can it be, since I have not touched her?" ||78||
They replied, "My lord, it is true that you have not touched her, but your touch has been revealed." ||79||

## Chapter 65: The Union of Vishalya

**414**

**Verse 78:** Lakshmana, seeing the danger to life in the battlefield, questioned the propriety of the marriage. In response, everyone said that he had already been touched by the bride, but it had not been revealed to him.

**Verse 79:** "O Lord! You have removed all obstacles for her. Please accept her hand in marriage." Thus, due to the people's pleas and the weight of their words, Lakshmana agreed to the marriage.

**Verse 80:** The wedding of Vishalya and Lakshmana took place on the battlefield itself. It was a celebration where all praiseworthy deeds were accomplished in a moment, where the celestial beings displayed their vast splendor, and which was equal to the joy imagined from divine wealth.

**Verse 81:** Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! Noble men who have performed good deeds in their previous lives, conquer death and quickly attain the union of excellent things. They achieve a state like the qualities of the moon and the sun."

Thus ends the sixty-fifth chapter of the Padmacharita, composed by Shri Ravishana Acharya, known as the Bhashya, which describes the union of Vishalya.

**End of the Second Part.**

By the eight-bodied gods,
Not seeing, for the sake of wandering on earth,
With wonderful deeds, he conquered the heads,
Today, with sharp arrows,
Today, Ravana is angry,
Today, this horse, this work,
Even today, of this, the roar, the evil one,
Today, that evil-doer,
I did not see, the divine weapons,

In rivers, in the mountains, or
In these rivers of pure water -
Having made a salutation with the name
The fearsome one was destroyed.
Indeed, you know this, just as
Our mind does not turn away from the Dharma, the sound of joy, at any other time.
Joy-increasing
The city of Nandyaavarta, Rama
Cannot be pleased.
They both arose from the sky
In the union of celestial beings
The same joy of the eyes
Not whose cloud-darkness
Not until he goes
Not right or
Not those who are the changes of the origin of existence
The hell-bound, terrible, human-dominated river, they are

With the celestial beings, worship, do not fear, do not fear, thus that 234 Do not fear, do not fear, turn away - 143 Making the sky dark
135
Gaining the sky-dweller

138
Having made a salutation to her, salutation to the Jinas
Saluting the best of the munis
Salute the Jina with devotion
Salutation to those who are worshipped by the three worlds
Of those who are burnt by the pride of men
Neither at night nor by day, sleep
Those men are beloved, praiseworthy
O king, see by whom
The true one of men and birds
The king is beautiful there, Nala, Nila, etc.
Nala's hand arose, or
Nala is blue, he is deprived of that
Like a dark cloud

In the Padma Purana
Full of youthful vigor
Born of youthful vigor
Possessing youthful vigor
There is no one to do this
We do not know what is ours
Karmas do not perish
Flesh does not arise from trees
With a new union, her
A new bird is bound, just as
He does not hear any sound
He does not hear, being engrossed in love
Having taken away the fear of destruction, that earth, not that water
Not by the opposition of nails, no one dies untimely
These two are bound by serpent nooses
Serpents, lions, etc., also here
Riding on a serpent chariot
Like a serpent king with his hand
With serpent-like, red-ochre-colored mountains
Not too far from there
Seeing
O Lord! Right or wrong
O Lord! Extend your arms, so long
O Lord! Tell me the place
O Lord! You alone are the hero
O Lord! This is excessive for me
O Lord! Command me what to do
O Lord! The sum of the meaningless
O Lord! In calamities, this is your left hand
O Lord! When he was in that state
It is not right to disregard here 235 O Lord! I am your devotee, some- 244

The sound is a destroyer of virtue, a sin

Narada, carrying the supreme
Narada, following his every step
Along with Narayana

Happy in mind, immediately,
Endured by the virtuous,
Grace of the virtuous, for him,

Laughing, they said this,
This blow of mine,
She is a common woman,
You are a common woman,
Some are standing in the front, those with a burden on their shoulders, those with a burden on their ears,
Those who are holding their lives,
Those who are afraid of death,
Having heard the Lord of life, the warriors of the neighborhood,
Unattainable, done by whom,
Unattainable, together with the unattainable,
Unattainable, done to them,
In the ends, all around,
Obtained by the influence of karma, obtained by the fear of the flood,

Wise one, you are blessed.
Bodhisatva, with his kindness,
Says this, until the Brahmin woman has finished this.
The Brahmin woman, and the wealthy one,
Say, there is no thirst, not even for Sita, who does not speak.
He is very happy, the old man, with his hand,
The great comet then said,
The great one, the great-bodied one,
The great-moving one, the younger one, with the great musical instruments,
[B]
Even though he is worshipped with devotion,
He who wears a garland of devotion, even though he is a moon-chariot,
O Lord, by your grace,
The Lord, made night, O Lord, this is completely,
The Lord, he is everywhere,
The sister, Durnava, of him,
The broken flower garden,
The broken high shop row, the soldiers, in this enemy army,
Worship the lords of the sky,
Worship the collection of good deeds, with that, worship with the moon's smile,
Worship now, happiness, son, the god also worships,
Worship all the actions, son, the army being worshipped, the breaking of the branches of the hand,
Bhadrad, what is this, a dream?
Bhadrad, you are well today,
Bhadrad, what is this, they say,
Bhadrad, who am I, of the grace,
Bhadrad, get up, Jatayu, the sky,
The drums, which are to be beaten,

In the Padma Purana,
He bowed down in fear,
Bharata is to be taught,
In the Bharata, in the Vidagdha,
What is Bharata's fault,
By Bharata's victory here,
Then Bharata's mother,
Bharata's three parts,
Bharata's, by me, Lord,
In Bharata's entire kingdom,
Bharata's abode, attained,
Bharata's, fire-bright,
Bharata then said,
Bharata is victorious, glorious,
Bharata, as if in sorrow,
My husband's, adorned body, your path is the same,
Your fame, creeper net,
By your influence, all obstacles,
If that brother, by you,
By you, in the garden of love,
By you, having desired,
By you, the best, pleased,
Your chest,
Become, brave, of the heroes,
The house, which is Jainendra's,
Remembering, in the house,
You, such a hero,
You, refuge, devotee,
You, I ask,
From you, beginning, the aforementioned,
The house of Bhavantaka,
Remembering, my ocean of births,
I become, umbrella-holder, having crossed the ocean of births,
It must be done, by the grateful one,
The world-essence,
The blessed souls, having attained,
Seeing the blessedness, of that one,
Blessed, O, until he comes,

Until he gives up his life
Until a woman desires me
Until there is any trouble, until some others
Until there are some in the world -
Until I give up my life
Of the warrior with a weapon in his hand, with well-trained horses
Well said, father, well said
Well said, indeed, of the very strong
Well said, of another, who has emerged for the purpose of war at the end of the age, a cloud of war
The war-turner, and the spring
And in war, having made up his mind
In war, the swan chariot there
The age-conqueror
Where the shining strong ones, of you two, doing the work of youth, the youth-knowledge-bearer, the youth, Vibhishana, then
I tell you briefly
Those who have accumulated from past lives
Those who are bowed down to, high, by whom the calf was not killed in battle, by whom the moon-nail-lord
Those who are freed by merit
Those who are
Those who are to see the wedding celebration
Those who have a shield and umbrella, those who do not have food in their hands
Those who have even one renunciation
By whom the eighth part of the journey of the ocean of the world
By a hundred yojanas
Who lights a lamp in the Jina temple
Who does not have other wives, who has the merit of the Nirvana stone

In the Padma Purana
Who is the form of prosperity, and anger
Who has desire for other women
Who, with the purpose of the welfare of the world
Who is this, with the greatest power
Who is this, Vibhishana, famous, who is this, who was freed
Who are Rama and Lakshmana by name
[<]
Giving up the blood-stained garment, those with blood-stained garments and heads, blood-stained stone-mountains, piled up
With the light of blood-red sorrow
What is that blood-red forest
Praiseworthy among the Rakshasas and others
The assembly of Rakshasa vassals
Protecting this vow, therefore, of the Rakshasas and the monkeys
The father's word must be protected
Those whose lives were protected by him, seeing them surrounded by enemies
The hero who has returned from battle
The battle-drum sounded, in the wheel of the world of battle, he
With joy at the onset of battle
He has supreme power in battle, he never gets desire anywhere
The jewel of brave men, and a heap of jewels and gold
Of those with jewel earrings, shining
Having obtained the three jewels, beautiful
What has the jewel-garlanded one begun
The jewel-garlanded one, again, with various jewel windows
The one who is riding on the chariot, coming
From the chariot, they quickly departed
Having descended from the chariot, the lotus-faced one
Having mounted the chariot-interior
Mounted on chariots, horses, and elephants, even the sun in the chariot

With divine, shining chariots
Having reached the hole in the forest, Bhima, with his mind fixed on the hole, and great joys
The death of Raman's son
The mind delights somewhere
The king of life delights
The beautiful temple there
On the beautiful, mountain-buttocks
Those who are very rich, high
What is this roar of the lion
At the end of the day, with the sun
The sun, shining with rays
Rama is also without this
Without the hundred-petaled lotus
This is one secret
This is the secret, to be told to the wise
By the lord of the Rakshasas
By the Rakshasas, with harsh voices
Those who are not born of the Raghus, the Raghus, mounted on the chariot
From royal courage, from where is this
At the time of the rise of the king's work
O king, the cruel, creeper of desire
O king, having fulfilled that
O king, the vajra-mouthed one, angry
O king, this is a strange form
Having reached the hand of the king's son
O king's daughter, test
Along with the king's daughter, the children, on the royal road, like mountains
Embraced by the king of kings
Knowing that the king has come
Having become a king, again, an enemy
Having arisen in the king's palace
Of this, the king's priest
Having been seized by the king
The daughter of another king, by name, rule the kingdom, my dear

This nectar of women is mine, O woman, all this is yours.
You are in this forest, free from the people.
Salutation to the Jinas.
Even the great serpents in the forest, we are your tapas-adhikāras.
O woman, we are your friends.
It is better to be under a cool tree.
It is better to be covered with flowers and fruits.
It is better to give that to him now.
All the virtues are yours.
May the beautiful palaces be yours.
It is better to die in this earth.
It is better to have a garland of flowers and fragrance.
It is better to give up food.
It is better to ride a great elephant.
It is better to have women.
It is better to have eyes like the fire of the sun.

It is better to have a boar, a buffalo, and a tiger.

The learned ones, the gods, freed from the greatness of knowledge,
These two are suitable for acquiring knowledge,
There was no gain of knowledge for them,
Knowledge is desired to be obtained in the time of blazing fire,
Making a weapon storehouse by some trick of fate,
By fate, they were made to cross over, by fate, they were made to be in the water,
Fate is like the goddess of love, fate is intertwined with each other,
Removing the pair of wings of fate, see the yoga I have done, the destruction of the vajra storehouse, endowed with virtues like humility,
Without these two, who are humble,
The destruction of that one came,
Immersed in the far-reaching, hearing his words,
The strength, character, and potential for lightning are suitable for the long-faced one with blazing fire mouths,
This one is a lightning bolt, wise,
This one is also a lightning bolt, a friend,
The king of the lightning forest,
The lightning-faced one,
The lightning-colored one,
The lightning-carrying one, the wind-carrying one,
To attain knowledge, to honor, and to make greatness, the creator, today, the power, the one with the teeth of creation, he also,
Making Janaki in the middle,
Making the high, immovable mountains,
Making the kingdom, the one stained with wealth and sin,
Making the bull, etc.,
The humble one, wearing the humble dress, abandoning the humble one,
The earth is humble, whose humble ones are skilled in the arts,
Entertainment is a thorn, truth,
Leaving the presented entertainment,
This Vindhya is full of treasures,
Placing the one full of devotion,
And making the creation in the lap,
To make us,
The one with large breasts and humble limbs,
In the large island of the demons,
After making the conversation,
With the harsh words of the Brahmin,
The Brahmin said by way of a remedy,
Awakened, they saw that one,
Awakening, some said here,
In the darkness of the night,
Expelling Vibhishana,
By the son of Vibhishana, Vibhishana, I have no sorrow,
In the union of Vibhishana,
Vibhishana, in the third, when Vibhishana came,
By Vibhishana, where first,
Hearing what Vibhishana said,
The Lord, to the city of the sun,
That glory of his, that one,
The one with great glory, and pure conduct in the world,
In the pure water, with the lotus,
The beautiful-peaked chariot,
The supreme shadow chariot,
The very large chariot of that one,
The chariot like the sun,
The chariot of the best form,
The chariot-carrying bells,
With beautiful ones like chariots,
Released from the suffering of relatives, released from all possessions, released from the crown of the door,
The one desiring the right hand, the one with the lightning bolt,
Seeing the sky, the earth, and the one who descended,
Separated from relatives, the sorrow of separation, death, disease,
By the fire of separation, very much,
The one who is completely disgusted,
The prince was insulted, the king of the insulted,
Another one was insulted,
All the kings are different,
He cried and grieved,
Making the lament,
All of you are for entertainment,
The dispute of the arrogant ones thus,
At the time of marriage,
Full of various vehicles,
Full of various cows,
They are devoid of reason,
He entered, thinking,
That one entered the lion's belly,
The one touched by the hand of the gentle one,
Calling the one named Visakha,
The one named with great light,
The one with the large lotus,
The one covered with large leaves,
The one named with great glory,
Born of a pure family, the ones with pure demon lineage,
The one who is confident in someone's wife,
As long as the minds are confident,
The clash of uneven mountains,
The one who is more uneven,
Whatever is subject to the senses,
The one with the horn-point, the one who is connected, the one who is sad, the ones who are gathered again, the incomparable sadness, god,
The one who is scattered in the underworld somewhere,

He who has been liberated from the worldly dharma for only a month,
He who has been wandering in the world for a long time,
There is no one else in the world,
He who has been wandering in the world for a long time,
The perfected Sun, O, you are the one,
Like a collection of desires,
With trembling hearts, Sita, all the liberated ones,
Having done penance with attachment,
Repeatedly doing the act of friendship,
O friend, see this hero,
You, O friend, are fainting because of her,
Here, the friend of the garland of flowers, the friend of this path,
Seen with flowing hands,
The doubt between them,
The sharp-pointed, clustered, moving danger,
He is facing the battle with the serpents,
The star is lost in the battle,
Facing the battle, brother,
In the battle, he is confused,
The death of the group, we, and I, the son, quickly,
The ministers, along with the ministers,
Perfectly united with the ministers,
Those who are truly devoted, honored by all,
Like water-filled clouds,
Seen in the company of his wife,
The water of the ocean of the virtuous,
The earth is perfectly adorned,
Moving towards that goal,
Thinking, "I have been deceived,"
Covering the sky with armies,
Constantly thinking of you,
With her endless devotion, the highest devotion,

Satsugriva, or you,
He was being taken away,
The limbs trembling with fear,
Seeing the arrow being fitted,
He instructed Sugriva,
Doubtful of his own lord,
Doubt, the heat of separation,

The east is colored by the evening,

With white waves, shining,
The one who pleases the assembly,
In the assembly of our father,
The nature of the planes,

The same, with the ear of the club,
