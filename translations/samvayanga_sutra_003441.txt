To the venerable Shraman Sangh's Marudhara Mantri, the most revered elder Guru-brother, the inspiring Muni Shri Hazarimallji Maharaj, whose indescribable peaceful facial expression conveyed the message of supreme peace and liberation to the noble beings, whose disciplined life was imbued with unparalleled simplicity, sattvika, gentleness, humility, and selflessness, who were equally respected, revered, and esteemed by Jain and non-Jain devotees due to their supreme benevolent nature and unparalleled affection for all beings, whose indirect blessings have resulted in the rapid completion of this arduous task of Agam Prakashan, who have played a significant role in my personality development, whose boundless kindness I am eternally indebted to, I humbly dedicate this work at their lotus feet.

The **Samavayanga Sutra** is a treasure trove of Jain principles. It provides ordinary people with an understanding of Jainism. Researchers find it essential to study, contemplate, and ponder this Agam text as it provides useful clues for their desired topics.

The **Samavayanga Sutra** has a unique style of presentation. After discussing substances with a fixed number from one to one hundred places, it includes the statement of **Anekootarik Vriddhi Samavay** along with an introduction to the **Dwadashanga Ganipitaka** and various subjects.

The **Shri Agam Prakashan Samiti** began the work of publishing Agams keeping in mind a memorable objective. With the inspiration of the revered late **Swamiji Shri Brajlalji Maharaj** and the guidance of the late **Yuvacharya Shri Madhukaramuniji Maharaj Saheb**, and the cooperation of other learned Muni Rajas and scholars, the committee has been progressing towards its goal day by day. Due to the increasing number of readers, the second editions of many published books have become unavailable. Therefore, it has been decided to publish the third editions of the books due to the increasing demand from readers.

So far, the second editions of **Acharanga Sutra Part-1, 2, and Jnatadharmakathanga, Upasakadasanga, Antahkrid Dasanga, Anuttaroppapatik Satta** have become unavailable and have been reprinted. This is the third edition of the **Samavayanga Sutra**. The third editions of the remaining books will also be published in due course. This will enable all 32 Agam texts to be collected in libraries and other repositories, so that self-study enthusiasts can benefit.

Although the cost of production has increased, the price of the books has been increased slightly. However, this price increase is still less than the cost.

Finally, we express our heartfelt gratitude and thanks to all our collaborators for their contribution to the Agam publication work.

Samvayanga Sutra: The first edition,
Despite being a small village in the Timvari Marudhara region, with its unique contribution to meaning, it holds significance in the Jain world. This is the village where the current young Acharya of the All India Shraman Sangh, the distinguished luminary of the Jain Sangh, Vidvadratna Muni Shri Mishrimalji Maharaj, was born. This is the same village whose fame is enhanced by the Shri Shrimal family.
The original foundation of Shri Shrimalji is 'Shri Ravatamal Hanutmal'. This vast family has made Durg (Madhya Pradesh) its karmabhoomi.
Late Shri Ravatamalji Sa. had three sons - Shri Hanutmalji, Shri Deepchandji and Shri Premrajji. Today, out of this trio, Seth Premrajji is present amongst us by the good fortune of society. Late Hanutmalji Sa. had a son, Shri Bhanwarlalji Sa., who also had three sons - Pravinkumarji, Pradeepkumarji and Prafullakumarji.

The Shri Shrimal family is not only vast in terms of numbers but also in terms of fame, glory and reputation. Every member of the family has a complete influence in their respective fields in the religious, educational, social and political trends of Durg city. It has a great reputation in the city. No field of public service is untouched by the support of this family.

## The Primal Word
(From the First Edition)

Among the world's philosophers and visionaries/thinkers who have contemplated 'Self-Existence' or achieved self-realization, they have also extensively pondered the means and methods of self-development for the benefit of others. Their contemplation and discourse on the soul and its related aspects are today known by various names like Agam/Pitaka/Veda/Upanishad.

Jain philosophy holds that the afflictions of the soul - attachment, aversion, etc. - can be overcome through spiritual practice. When these afflictions are completely eradicated, the soul's powers of knowledge, bliss, and energy are fully revealed and illuminated. The complete illumination and development of these powers is called omniscience, and the words/utterances/pronouncements of an omniscient/liberated being are known as "Agam." Agam means the scripture/sutra/divine word that imparts true knowledge, self-knowledge, and proper conduct.

Generally, the words/utterances of an omniscient being are not compiled; they are like scattered flowers. However, exceptional omniscient beings with extraordinary qualities, who establish the path of Dharma, and who establish spiritual practice in the monastic life, are called Dharma-founders/Arihants or Tirthankaras. The benevolent words of the Tirthankara are compiled by their highly learned disciples, the Ganadharas, into the form of "Agam" or scripture. In other words, when the free rain of words like flowers of the Jinas is collected into a garland, it takes the form of "Agam." This Agam, the words of the Jinas, is the primary source of self-knowledge or liberation-knowledge for all of us.

In ancient times, "Agam" was called "Ganipitaka." The entire body of scriptures in the form of the Arihants' discourses is contained in the twelve-fold scripture (Dwadashanga), and from the twelve-fold scripture/Acharanga-Sutrakritanga, etc., many subdivisions and sub-subdivisions have developed. The study of the twelve-fold scripture is considered essential and beneficial for every seeker. The twelfth part of the twelve-fold scripture is considered a vast and comprehensive repository of scriptural knowledge, and its study is only possible for seekers with exceptional talent and scriptural knowledge. Therefore, the study of the eleven-fold scripture is prescribed for seekers, and everyone's focus has been on this.

When there was no tradition of writing, and the means of writing were very limited, the Agams/scriptures were preserved through memory or by memorizing them through the Guru-parampara (lineage of teachers). Perhaps this is why Agam knowledge is called Shruta-gyan (knowledge acquired through hearing), and why meaningful words like Shruti (hearing) and Smriti (memory) are used. For a thousand years after the Nirvana of Lord Mahavira, the knowledge of the Agams was based solely on the Smriti/Shruti tradition. Later, due to the weakening of memory, the breaking of the Guru-parampara, the effects of calamities, and other reasons, Agam knowledge gradually disappeared. The water of the great lake dried up, leaving only a puddle. This was a cause for concern for the seeker Shramanas, but it was also a challenge to their thinking and awareness. They became determined to preserve the treasure of Shruta-gyan. At that time, the great Shruta-paragami (master of scriptures) Devarddhigani Kshamashraman called a gathering of learned Shramanas, and to address the loss of knowledge due to memory lapses,

Page #15:
---------------------------
A call was made to preserve and safeguard the Agam knowledge. The Agams were documented by consensus. This historic work of putting the Jinvani into writing has truly proved to be an indescribable benefit for the entire knowledge-thirsty populace of today. This endeavor to keep the ancient stream of knowledge of culture, philosophy, religion, and self-knowledge flowing took place in the ancient city of Vallabhi (Saurashtra) under the leadership of Acharya Shri Devardigni Kshamasraman, 980 or 993 years after the Nirvan of the Tirthankaras. This was the second and final recitation of the Jain Agams; however, it was the first attempt to document them. The final form of the Jain Sutras that we have today was completed in this recitation.

After being documented, the form of the Agams was preserved in its original form, but due to the passage of time, internal differences of opinion among the Shraman Sanghas, weakness of memory, negligence, and the destruction of vast knowledge repositories due to foreign invasions in the land of India, and many other reasons, the vast wealth of Agam knowledge, the proper Guru-Parampara of understanding, gradually declined and did not stop from becoming extinct. Many important verses, references, and their esoteric meanings of the Agams became fragmented. Due to the lack of mature language skills, the Agams that were written by hand were not pure in text, and those who could give the correct meaning were rare. Thus, for many reasons, the sacred stream of the Agams became constricted.

In the 16th century Vikram era, Veer Lonkashah made a revolutionary effort in this direction. A bold initiative to elucidate the pure and true meaning of the Agams was started again. But after some time, obstacles arose in it as well. Communal hatred, theoretical conflict, and the limited knowledge of the scribes became a major obstacle in the attainment of the Agams and their correct understanding. It became difficult for Agam scholars to obtain pure copies.

In the first phase of the 19th century, when the tradition of printing the Agams began, educated readers got some relief. Gradually, through scholarly efforts, the ancient Churnis, Niyuktis, and Tikas of the Agams came to light, and based on them, the clear and easy understanding of the Agams was published in simple language. This benefited the Agam students and knowledge-seekers. As a result, the trend of reading and studying the Agams has increased. My experience is that today, the trend of Agam study has increased more than ever before, and there is a growing attraction and interest in the Agams among the people. The influence and contribution of many foreign Agam scholars and Indian non-Jain scholars in the service of Agam-Shruti is also a factor in this awakening of interest, which we accept with pride.

This process of Agam editing and publication has been going on systematically for almost a century. Many capable Shramans and hardworking scholars have contributed to this great service to Shruti. Their services, like the bricks of a foundation, may be invisible today, but they are by no means forgettable. In the absence of clear and sufficient mentions, we are unable to mention them in more detail, but we are humble and grateful. Nevertheless, I would like to mention the names of some specific Agam Shruti-serving Munivar of the Jain tradition.

About sixty years ago, Pujya Shri Amolkarishiji Maharaj started the work of editing the 32 Sutras of the Jain Agams in Prakrit.

Page #16:
---------------------------
This was translated from the standing dialect. They single-handedly completed the translation work of thirty-two Sutras in just 3 years and 15 days, an amazing feat. Their unwavering dedication, courage, and seriousness about Agam knowledge are evident from their work itself. These 32 Agams were also published during this time.
This made Agam reading very easy and widespread, and the Sthanakwasi-Terapanthi community was particularly benefited. Gurudev Shri Joravarmalji Maharaj's resolve
When I was studying and practicing Agams in the presence of the memorable Gurudev Swami Shri Joravarmalji M., some Agams were available with the commentaries of Acharya Abhaydev and Sheelank published by the Agamoday Committee. I used to study and read based on them. Gurudev Shri experienced many times - although this edition is quite laborious and useful, it is also mostly pure in the editions available so far, yet many places are unclear, there are also inaccuracies and differences in the original texts and the commentary. They are difficult for the common people. Since Gurudev Shri himself was a profound scholar of Agams, he had received many profound meanings of Agams from his Guru. His intellect was also derived and argumentative, so he felt this deficiency and wanted a pure, all-purpose publication of Agams, from which ordinary knowledgeable Shraman-Shramani and inquisitive people could benefit. This longing of his mind was expressed many times. But due to some circumstances, his dream-resolve could not be realized, yet it definitely remained an inspiration in my mind.
In the meantime, Acharya Shri Jawaharlalji Maharaj, the first Acharya of the Shraman Sangh, Jain Dharma Diwakar Acharya Shri Atmaramji M., Vidvadratna Shri Ghasilalji M. etc. wise Munivers have tried to fill the gap by writing beautiful detailed commentaries on Agams in Hindi, Sanskrit, Gujarati etc. or by having them written under their supervision.
The learned Shraman Parmashrutsevi late Muni Shri Punyavijayji, a scholar of the Shwetambar Murtipujak Aamnay, had started a very systematic and high-quality work in the direction of Agam editing. Scholars praised it very much. But after his demise, there was an obstruction in it. Nevertheless, under the supervision of Agamjna Muni Shri Jambhuvijayji etc., the beautiful and high-quality work of Agam-editing is still going on today.
Currently, the work of Agam-editing is going on in the Terapanth sect under the leadership of Acharya Shri Tulsi and Yuvacharya Mahaprajñaji, and scholars are happy to see the published Agams. Although there is a lot of scope for disagreement in their text decisions. Nevertheless, their labor is important. Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal" is trying to publish the statements of Agams by classifying them in Anuyogs. The clarity and originality of his work style is evident in some of the Agams edited by him.
Senior scholars of Agam literature, Pt. Shri Bechardasji Doshy, renowned wise Shri Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya, such contemplative wise men are themselves working in the direction of modern editing of Agams and are guiding many scholars. This is a matter of happiness.
[13]

Page #17:
---------------------------
After a comprehensive overview of all these work styles, a resolve arose in my mind. Today, the work styles of scholars are quite diverse. In some places, the original text of the Agamas is being published, while in others, extensive commentaries on the Agamas are being written. One is incomprehensible to a reader, while the other is complex. It is essential to follow a middle path so that the common reader can easily obtain knowledge of the Agamas. There should be an edition of the Agamas that is simple, understandable, concise, and authentic. My late Gurudev desired such an Agama edition. Keeping this sentiment in mind, I started discussing this topic 5-6 years ago. After long contemplation, on Vaishakh Shukla Dashami, 2036 VS, the day of Lord Mahavira's Kaivalya, I declared this firm resolve and also began the editing and commentary work of the Agamabattisi. In this bold decision, the inspiration/encouragement and guidance of my Guru-brother, Shasanasevi Shri Brajlalji M., has been my primary support. Along with this, I have received the devotional support of many Munivar and Sadgrihasthi, whose names I cannot mention without my heart being satisfied. Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal", the editor of the Agama Anuyog Shaili, the renowned writer Shri Devendramuni M. Shastri, Acharya Shri Atmaramji M.'s disciple, Bhandari Shri Padamchandji M., and Pravachan Bhushan Shri Amarmuniji, Vidvadratna Shri Gyanmuniji M.; the disciples of the late learned Mahasati Shri Ujjvalkunwarji M., Mahasati Divyaprabhaji, M.A. Ph.D.; Mahasati Muktiprabhaji and learned Mahasati Shri Umravkunwarji M. 'Archana', renowned scholar Shri Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya, well-known scholar Pandit Shri Shobhachandji Bharill, late Pandit Shri Hiralalji Shastri, Dr. Chaganlalji Shastri and Shri Chandji Sarana "Saras", etc. The support of these intellectuals has made this arduous task of Agama editing easier. My heart is overwhelmed with respect and gratitude towards all of them. Along with this, the companionship and support of the service-minded disciples Muni Vinaykumar and Mahendra Muni, the service spirit of Mahasati Shri Kanakunwarji, Mahasati Shri Jhanarkunwarji has always been an inspiration. On this occasion, the memory of the inspiration source of this work, late Shri Vak Chiman Singhji Lodha, late Shri Pukharajji Sissodia also comes naturally, whose tireless efforts have made the Agama Committee successful in its work so quickly. The printing of ten Agama texts and the translation and editing of about 1520 Agamas in this short period of two years is a testament to the deep dedication of all our collaborators.
I have strong faith that with the blessings of the most revered late Swami Shri Hazarimlalji Maharaj and other Tapasvi souls, and with the goodwill and cooperation of our Shraman Sangh's fortunate leader, Rashtra-Sant Acharya Shri Anandrishiji M. and other Munijans, this planned editing and publication work of Jinvani will be completed soon.
With this auspicious wish,
- Muni Mishrimal 'Madhukar'

## Introduction to the Samvayanga Sutra: A Critical Study
(From the First Edition) Name-Understanding

The compilation and assessment of the pure words of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira was first done by his chief disciples, the Ganadharas. That compilation and assessment is known as the Ang Sutras. There are twelve Angas - Ayar, Suyagad, Thaan, Samvay, Vivahapanatti, Mmakha, Uvasgadasa, Antagadadsa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Panhavagaran, Vivagasuy and Dilva. Currently, the twelfth Anga, Drishtivad, is unavailable. The remaining eleven Angas include Samvay, which holds the fourth position. It has a unique place in the Agam literature. It is an unparalleled treasure trove of important facts about biology, atomic science, cosmology, spirituality, philosophy, and history. Acharya Abhaydev has written - This Agam presents a detailed description or classification of Jiva, Ajiv, and other substances. Therefore, this Agam is named Samvay or Samvaao. Siddhantachkravarti Acharya Nemichandra has written that it determines the similarities and commonalities of Jiva and other substances. Therefore, it is named "Samvay".3

## Subject Matter

Acharya Devavachka has given the subject index of Samvayanga, which is as follows: (1) Classification of Jiva, Ajiv, Lok, Alok, and Swasamay Parasamay. (2) Development of numbers from one to one hundred. (3) Introduction to the Dvadasanga Ganipitaka. The present Agam also provides a subject index of Samvay, which is as follows:
(1) Classification of Jiva, Ajiv, Lok, Alok, Swasamay and Parasamay. (2) Development of subjects from one to one hundred numbers. (3) Description of Dvadasangi Ganipitaka, (4) Ahar (5) Uchchvas (6) Leshya (7) Avas (8) Uppaat (9) Chyavan (10) Avgaah (11) Vedana (12) Vidhan (13) Upayog (14) Yog (15) Indriya (16) Kashay (17) Yoni (18) Kulkar (19) Tirthankar (20) Ganadhar (21) Chakravarti (22) Baldev-Vasudeva.

-Nandi Sutra 83 Samvayanga, Prakirnak

Page #21:
---------------------------
A deep study of the indexes found in both the Nandī Sūtra and the Samavāyāṅga reveals that the list of Āgama topics in the Nandī Sūtra is very concise, while the list in the Samavāyāṅga is very detailed. It is clearly indicated that there is an increase of one hundred and one in both the Nandī and the Samavāyāṅga, but there is no indication of an increase of many. In the Nandī Cūrṇi, Jinadāsagaṇi Mahātara, in the Nandī Haribhadrīyā Vṛtti, Ācārya Haribhadra, and in the Vṛtti of the Nandī, Ācārya Malayagiri, have not indicated any increase of many. Ācārya Abhaydeva has mentioned an increase of many in the Samavāyāṅga Vṛtti. According to Ācārya Abhaydeva, there is an increase of one hundred and one, and after that, there is an increase of many. The opinion of the learned is that the commentator has not mentioned this based on the description of the Samavāyāṅga, but has described it based on the text found in the Samavāyāṅga.

It is natural to wonder if the introduction of the Samavāyāṅga given in the Nandī Sūtra is different from the Samavāyāṅga available today, or if the Samavāyāṅga that is available today is not from the recitation of Devardvigani Kṣamāśramaṇa. If it were, why would there be a difference in the two descriptions? The solution is that the description of the Samavāyāṅga in the Nandī ends with the description of the Dvādaśāṅgī. However, the Samavāyāṅga that is available today presents many topics beyond the Dvādaśāṅgī. Therefore, it is different from the description of the Samavāyāṅga in the Nandī in terms of its size. We have clarified in the introduction to the Staānaṅga Sūtra that there were five recitations of the Āgamas after Śramaṇa Bhagavān Mahāvīra. Ācārya Abhaydeva has mentioned the great recitation of the present Āgama in the Vṛtti of the present Āgama. From this, it can be inferred that the introduction of the Samavāyāṅga given by Devavācaka in the Nandī may have been given from the perspective of the small recitation.

Regarding the expanded size of the Samavāyāṅga, some wise men have made two inferences. It cannot be said for certain how far both these inferences are based on truth and fact. In my view, if the Samavāyāṅga were from a separate recitation, there would certainly be some echoes of it somewhere in the ancient literature. But there is no such echo regarding the Samavāyāṅga. For example, the Jyotiṣakaraṇḍa text is from the Māthurī recitation, but there is nothing like that regarding the Samavāyāṅga. Therefore, the first inference of the learned is only an inference. It lacks reality. Regarding the second inference, it is humbly submitted that the Bhagavatī Sūtra indicates the need to look at the last part of the Samavāyāṅga regarding the complete description of the Kulkaras and Tīrthaṅkaras, etc. Similarly, the Staānaṅga also instructs to look at the last part of the Samavāyāṅga for the complete description of Baldeva and Vasudeva. This discussion makes it clear that the appendix section in the Samavāyāṅga has been added to the Samavāyāṅga by Devardvigani Kṣamāśramaṇa.

It is a matter of investigation for the researcher that if Devardvigani Kṣamāśramaṇa is the compiler of both the Nandī and the Samavāyāṅga, then why did he not maintain uniformity in the descriptions given in both the Āgamas? Why were two types of descriptions given? The solution is that many recitations have taken place from time to time. Due to many recitations, there are many different texts, words, and relationships, and there is an increase of one hundred and one, and then an increase of many.

- Staānaṅga 9, Sūtra 672, Muni Kanhaiyalalji 'Kamal' [18]

---------------------------
It is possible that these variations in the text are due to the addition of commentaries or appendices. Scholars have speculated that the latter part of the Dvadasangi in the Samavayanga is its appendix section. The appendix section is not mentioned in the list of the Nandī Sūtra. Therefore, the list of the Samavayanga has become extensive. It is a matter of contemplation for those who are well-versed in the essence of the Agamas as to why the summary of eleven topics in the appendix section of the Samavayanga has been included in it.

**Pātāla**

The currently available text of the Samavayanga comprises 1667 verses. It introduces all the elements, starting from earth, sky, life in the three worlds, etc., in terms of substance, space, time, and emotion, from one to countless numbers. It also includes a collection of material related to geography, astronomy, etc., along with descriptions related to spiritual elements, Tīrthankaras, Gaṇadharas, Cakravartīs, and Vasudevas. Similar to the Sthānāṅga, the Samavayanga also presents a description in numerical order. The style of both Agamas is similar. Despite being similar, the Sthānāṅga presents a description from one to ten, while the Samavayanga presents topics from one to countless numbers. Like the Sthānāṅga, the number of chapters in the Samavayanga is not fixed. This is why Ācārya Devavācak, while introducing the Samavayanga, has indicated only one study. This treasury-style is very ancient. This style has been very useful from the perspective of remembering. This style is also visible in other Agamas. In the thirty-first study of the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra, in the section on the method of conduct, the enumeration of objects from one to thirty-three has been done. What are the unwise tendencies? How can one avoid them and how can one develop wise tendencies, etc.

**Style**

The treasury-style presented in the Sthānāṅga and Samavayanga is also found in the Buddhist tradition and the Vedic tradition! Buddhist texts like the Anguttara Nikāya, the Puggalapannatti, the Mahāvyutpatti, and the Dharmasangraha have collected thoughts in a similar way.

In the 134th chapter of the Vana Parva of the Mahābhārata, there is a dialogue between Nandī and Aṣṭāvakra. In it, both sides enumerate objects from one to thirteen. In ancient times, writing materials were scarce. Printing was completely absent. Therefore, a number-based style was adopted for the ease of memory.

Despite being a treasury-style with a collection of topics, the Samavayanga does not maintain uniformity from beginning to end in many places. For example, in many places, the characters of individuals have been included. Descriptions of mountains have been included, as well as dialogues, etc. In the present Agama, at the end of the first sūtra, which is a number, this statement has been made: How many beings will attain liberation in one birth? After that, from two to thirty-three, this has been stated. After that, there is no statement. This raises the question in the mind of the seeker: Will those who have thirty-four births or more attain liberation? There is no solution to this.

From our perspective, it seems that Ācārya Devarddhigaṇi, while compiling the Agamas during the time of Kṣamāśramaṇa, may not have paid attention, or some texts may have been forgotten, which he may not have filled in for fear of the endless world not increasing.

We have already mentioned that the topics in the present Agama have been presented from the perspective of numbers. Therefore, it is not necessary that after that topic, another topic should be in line with it. Each topic is from the perspective of numbers.
[19]

---------------------------
It is complete in itself, yet Acharya Abhaydeva has attempted to establish a connection between one topic and another in his commentary. In some places, he has been completely successful, while in others, it appears that the commentator has attempted to establish a connection on his own. In fact, it is not necessary for one sutra to be connected to another in this style. Whatever topic came up in terms of number was compiled in this Agam.

**Description from the perspective of the fourfold**

In the Samavayanga, the जीव, पुद्गल, धर्म, अधर्म, आकाश, etc. are described from the perspective of द्रव्य. From the perspective of क्षेत्र, light is shed on लोक, अलोक, सिद्धशिला, etc. From the perspective of काल, contemplation has been done on time, आवलिका, मुहूर्त, etc., up to पल्योपम, सागरोपम, उत्सर्पिणी, अवसर्पिणी, and the state of the four गति of जीव, etc., as well as पुद्गल-परावर्तन. From the perspective of भाव, there is a description of the भाव of the जीव, such as ज्ञान, दर्शन, चारित्र, and वीर्य, and also a description of the अजीव भाव, such as वर्ण, गन्ध, रस, संस्थान, स्पर्श, etc.

**First Samavay: Analysis**

In the first Samavay of the Samavayanga, while expounding on the जीव, अजीव, etc. principles, आत्मा, अनात्मा, दण्ड, अदण्ड, क्रिया, अक्रिया, लोक, अलोक, धर्मास्तिकाय, अधर्मास्तिकाय, पुण्य, पाप, बन्ध, मोक्ष, आश्रव, संवर, वेदना, निर्जरा, etc. are explained one by one from the perspective of संग्रहनय. After that, there is a mention of Jambudvipa, which is one lakh yojanas in length and breadth, and the सर्वार्थसिद्ध विमान, etc. A description is given of the नारक, देव, etc., which are in the state of one ocean.

In the first Samavay, the scholar has very briefly expounded on the fundamental principles of Jain philosophy. The most important question in Indian philosophies has been that of the आत्मा. Other philosophers have also contemplated on the आत्मा, but their contemplation was not profound. Different philosophers had different opinions. Many philosophers consider the आत्मा to be vast, while many others consider the आत्मा to be the size of a thumb or a grain of rice. Jain philosophy has described the आत्मा from the perspective of अनेकान्त. It considers the जीव to be परिणामी नित्य. From the perspective of द्रव्य, the जीव is नित्य, while from the perspective of पर्याय, it is अनित्य. Here, in the present एकस्थानक समवाय, even though the आत्मा is infinite, all आत्मा are असख्यात प्रदेशी and are similar in terms of चेतनत्व. All आत्मा are स्वदेहपरिमाण. Therefore, the आत्मा is said to be one here. Since knowledge of the आत्मतत्त्व is essential first, both the स्थानांग and समवायांग Agams have discussed the आत्मा first.

Along with knowing the आत्मा, it is also necessary to know the अनात्मा. The अनात्मा is called अजीव. The आत्मा is corrupted in relation to the अजीव. It undergoes विभाव परिणति. Therefore, knowledge of the अजीव principle is also necessary. From the perspective of अचेतनत्व सामान्य, the अजीव is one. धर्मास्तिकाय, अधर्मास्तिकाय, आकाशस्तिकाय, and काल, all these are अजीव. They do not cause grace or harm to the आत्मा. The पुद्गल द्रव्य is the one that harms the आत्मा. The body, mind, senses, breath, speech, etc. are पुद्गल. They become चेतनायमान due to contact with the चेतन. All the substances in the world that have form, taste, smell, and touch are all पौद्गलिक. Sound, light, shadow, darkness, cold and heat are all states of the पुद्गल स्कन्ध and are the same root center of attachment. Any nerve in the body...

When an institution becomes corrupted, its knowledge development stops. However, it is true that the soul has a completely independent existence. It is like a light that is different from oil and a vessel. The power by which the body is becoming conscious is different from the inner light. The soul, due to the subtle karmic body, takes on another gross body when the gross body is destroyed. Therefore, knowledge of the soul and non-soul is necessary for spiritual practice. Similarly, the discussion of punishment, non-punishment, action, inaction, etc. is also useful for those seeking liberation.

In Indian thought, the concept of "lok" (world) has been discussed extensively. "Lok" is the basis of all substances in the universe. Lokvad (theory of the world) includes both infinite beings and non-beings. Lok is where dharma, adharma, time, pudgala, and jiva reside. If we look at lok from a holistic perspective, from the perspective of lineage, it is eternal and infinite. No substance can be destroyed, and nothing can be created from non-existence. No one can increase the number of substances even by a single atom. From the perspective of the constantly changing material elements, lok is finite. From the perspective of substance, lok is eternal. From the perspective of elements, it is impermanent. Time is a simple cause in the creation of actions, which is present in the result of every changing substance. It is also changing like other substances. Lok is the space where all six substances are found. Beyond that, only space exists, which is called "alok" (non-world). Because dharma and adharma substances are simple causes in the movement and position of jiva and pudgala. As long as there is harmony between dharma and adharma substances, the movement and position of jiva and pudgala are possible. Therefore, the middle part of the sky, which is shaped like a man, is called lok, which is equal to dharma and adharma substances. Dharma, adharma, and lok are similar in terms of measurement. Therefore, like lok, alok is also one.

The Jain Agam literature has a clear description of jiva and ajiv, which is not found in Buddhist literature. In the Buddhist text Anguttaranikaya, the question of whether lok is infinite or finite is left unanswered by the Tathagata Buddha. He only said about lok that it is composed of five material qualities: form, taste, etc. The one who abandons these five material qualities wanders in the end of lok.

The words "punya" (merit) and "papa" (sin) are very famous in Indian literature. Good deeds are punya, and bad deeds are papa. Punya gives the soul the experience of happiness, and papa gives the experience of suffering. There are two types of punya and papa: substance and feeling. The karma that gives the soul the experience of happiness is substance karma, and the good results of the soul's compassion, kindness, charity, and feelings are feeling punya. Similarly, the karma that gives the soul the experience of suffering is substance papa, and the bad results of the soul's feelings are feeling papa. The Sankhyakarika also mentions that punya leads to upward movement and papa leads to downward movement. The Nainaacharyas have also said that the result of good intentions is heaven, and the result of bad intentions is hell.

Like punya and papa, the discussion of bandha (bondage) and moksha (liberation) is also found extensively in Indian literature. The specific relationship between two substances is called bandha. Thus, bandha is called one here. But it has two types: feeling bandha and substance bandha. The feelings of attachment, hatred, and delusion, etc., which bind karma, are called feeling bandha. And the connection of karma-pudgalas with the soul's regions is substance bandha. Substance bandha is the connection between the soul and pudgala.

This is related to. It is absolutely true that two substances can come together but not become one. Two can appear as one, but the essence of one cannot be extinguished and the other remain. Acharya Umaswati12 has written that due to yoga, subtle karma-pudgala become one-field-going with all the soul-regions. That is, the karma-pudgala remain in the same region as the soul-regions and become bound with the living being. This is called Pradeshbandha. There is no chemical mixture of any kind between the soul and the karma-body other than one-field-going. There is a chemical mixture of new karma-pudgala with ancient karma-pudgala, but not with soul-regions. The soul-regions vibrate due to the living being's passions. This attracts karma-worthy pudgala. From this yoga, a nature, that is, a special kind of disposition, arises in those karma-vargana. If those karma-pudgala are attracted by an action that obstructs knowledge, then they will have the nature of covering knowledge. If they are attracted by passions, then according to the intensity and mildness of the passions, a nature of bearing fruit arises in that karma-pudgala. Pradeshbandha and Prakritibandha happen due to yoga. And sthiti and anubhagabandh are due to passions.

Complete liberation from karmabandha is moksha. The direct and simple meaning of moksha is - to be released. The soul, which was bound by karmabandha from time immemorial, becomes completely free when those bonds are broken. This is called liberation. In the Buddhist tradition, the word "nirvana" is used in the sense of moksha. They have assumed the extinction of the soul in the sense of the extinction of afflictions, which has obscured the true nature of nirvana. Destroying karma simply means that the karma-pudgala become separate from the soul. Those karmas are not completely destroyed.13 The complete destruction of any being does not happen in any of the three times. The change of state is called destruction. The karma-pudgala, which were in contact with the soul and were destroying the soul's qualities, were endowed with the karma-state. That karma-state is destroyed. Just as the soul becomes pure after being liberated from karmabandha, so too the karma-pudgala become free from the karma-state. From the Jain perspective, the separation of the soul and karma-pudgala is moksha.

After bondage and liberation, there is mention of one inflow and one restraint. Falsehood, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and yoga are the inflows. The inflow of karma due to emotions is called bhavasrav, and the inflow of karma-substance is called dravyasrav. In other words, the development of the karma-state in pudgala is dravyasrav. Generally, there are two types of inflow - one is sampraayik inflow, which is the cause of bondage due to yoga influenced by passions and increases the world. The other is iryapatha inflow, which is only due to yoga. In this, there is no passion, so there is no bondage in the form of state and result. This inflow happens only to the liberated great souls. Passion and yoga are present in every worldly soul. Due to this, there is a continuous inflow of the seven karmas. In the previous life, the inflow of the lifespan karma happens in the division of the present lifespan for the attainment of the body etc., or it happens in the ninth part, or in the twenty-seventh part, or when there is a remainder of the inner moment.4.

Name-pronouncements are everywhere due to the special yoga, subtle one-field-going, situated in all the soul-regions, infinite and infinite regions. -Tattvarth Sutra 8/14 Analysis from the living being is difference, essence is not complete destruction. -Aaptapariksha-115 Sovakkamauya Pun, Sesatibhage Ahava Navambhage.

[22]

Sanvara is the opposite of Asrava. Sanvara is the restraint of the causes that bind karma. It mainly happens due to Asrava Yoga. Therefore, the cessation of Yoga is Sanvara.

The Tathagata Buddha has mentioned Sanvara. He has explained it by dividing it as follows: (1) Sanvara controls the senses and when the senses are controlled, they become secret senses, which prevents sensory Asrava. (2) Pratisevna - If one does not eat, drink, wear clothes, take medicine, etc., the mind does not remain happy and if the mind does not remain happy, karma is bound. Therefore, to keep the mind happy, these should be used, which will prevent Asrava. It should be remembered here that if it is used from the point of view of enjoyment, then it is the cause of Asrava. (3) Adhivasana - Some have the ability to endure physical pain. He likes physical pain. Then he gets Asrava-restraint from enduring pain. (4) Parivarjana - Cruel elephants, horses, etc. animals, snakes scorpions etc. animals, pits thorns places; sinful friends, all these are causes of suffering. By abandoning those causes of suffering, Asrava is restrained. (5) Vinodana - If one does not break the binding thoughts like violence, sinful thoughts, lustful thoughts, etc., then the Asrava arising from them is restrained. (6) Bhavana - Asrava is restrained by good thoughts. If good thoughts are not cultivated, then bad thoughts will arise. Therefore, good thoughts are the cause of restraint of Asrava to restrain bad thoughts.
-Anguttara Nikaya 6/58

After Asrava and Sanvara, there is mention of Vedana and Nirjara. To experience karma is 'Vedana'. It is of two types. To experience Vedana at the time when the state of Abadikal is complete, and to bring forth the karma that is eligible to arise in the future, the being brings it into the Udayavali before the ripening of the state due to his special determination, this is Udirana. To experience the karma brought forth by Udirana, this is the second type. Buddhists have said that the cause of Asrava is Avidya. Restraining Avidya is the same as restraining Asrava. They have divided Asrava into three types: Kama Asrava, Bhaya Asrava and Avidya Asrava.
-Anguttara Nikaya 3,58,6,63

After Vedana, there is mention of Nirjara. Nirjara means the destruction of accumulated karma. The 24th Acharya Hemchandra has written that karma is the seed of Bhava-bhramana. The separation of those karmas from the Atma-pradeshas is "Nirjara". It is of two types - Sakamaniriara and Akamaniriara. The destruction of karma by means of effort and knowledge, such as tapasya, etc., is Sakamaniriara. In Sakamaniriara, there is discrimination between the soul and liberation, due to which even the smallest Nirjara is capable of giving great results. An ignorant being cannot exhaust as much karma in millions of years as a wise person can exhaust in a single breath. Akamaniriara is that - when the state of karma is complete, when the karma is experienced, their separation. Due to dependence, the restraint of enjoyment and consumption also leads to Akamaniriara. For example, a being in hell or in the animal realm endures unbearable pain, terrible torture, piercing and cutting. And even in human life, he endures suffering unwillingly due to compulsion. It is of two types.

A formal or non-fruitive shedding of karma is called **avipaak nirjara**, while an informal or fruitive shedding of karma is called **savipaak nirjara**.  Forcing karma to arise through austerities, etc., and then shedding it without experiencing its fruit is **avipaak nirjara**.  Naturally shedding karma by experiencing its fruit at every moment is **savipaak nirjara**.  Every being experiences **savipaak nirjara** every moment, every instant.  New karmas keep taking the place of old karmas.  Burning away karmas before they bear fruit through the fire of austerity is **aupakramik nirjara**.  The fruit of karma cannot be avoided, "Karma that is not experienced does not decay even after millions of kalpas" - this rule applies to the **pradeshodaya** but not to the **vipaakodaya**.  The present statement applies to ordinary worldly souls who are **pravahapatita**.  **Purusharthi** seekers burn all karmas in an instant in the fire of meditation.  Thus, the first **samavaya** sheds light on the main principles of Jainism - soul, non-soul, bondage, causes of bondage, liberation, and causes of liberation.  The description of the non-soul along with the soul is necessary because the soul is deviating from its own nature due to non-living, **paudgalik** karmas.  From the perspective of collection, the author has expressed profound secrets in this **samavaya**.

**Second Samavaya: Analysis**

The second **samavaya** describes two types of punishment, two types of bondage, two constellations - **Purvafalguni** and **Uttarafalguni**, two stars in these constellations, two states of hellish beings and gods, two metaphors of **palyopam** and **sagaropama**, and two types of existence for **bhavasiddhik** beings who attain liberation.  First, it describes punishment.  **Artha-danda** and **anarth-danda** are the two types of punishment.  The act of violence, etc., that is done for the protection of one's own body, for the sustenance of family, society, country, and nation is **artha-danda**.  The intention to begin is not the main thing in **artha-danda**.  It is undertaken to achieve a purpose, motivated by duty.  **Anarth-danda** means to commit sin without any purpose, uselessly.  The thermometer for measuring **artha-danda** and **anarth-danda** is **viveka** (discernment).  Many actions are **artha** due to specific circumstances.  When circumstances change, the same actions become **anarth**.  Acharya Umaswati has defined the words **artha** and **anarth** in such a way that what is consumed and enjoyed is **artha** for the **shravak**, and what is different from that, in which there is no consumption or enjoyment, is **anarth-danda**.  Acharya Abhaydeva has written that the meaning of **artha** is "purpose".  A householder protects his field, house, grain, wealth, or sustains his body, etc.  In all these activities, the oppression of beings through initiation is **artha-danda**.  Punishment, suppression, torture, and destruction are all synonymous.  In contrast to **artha-danda**, only carelessness, foolishness, and unwise, purposeless, useless destruction of beings is **anarth-danda**.  The seeker avoids **anarth-danda**.

After **artha-danda** and **anarth-danda**, the statement of living beings and non-living beings is made.  The commentator, Acharya Abhaydeva, has indicated in his commentary that this topic should be understood from the **Prajnapanasutra** along with its divisions and subdivisions.  Without going into that much detail here, we will point out that place to the readers and mention that there was a great deal of disagreement about the number of living and non-living elements during the time of Lord Mahavira.  On the one hand, the Upanishads believed that the entire universe is the result of a single element, while on the other hand, according to the Sankhya, there are living beings and non-living beings.

Page #28:
---------------------------
There is one. Buddhists believe that there are many minds and many forms. From this perspective, the Jain view was necessary. Among other philosophies, only Samkhya has a description. While the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra has been contemplated from many perspectives. Just as there is contemplation on beings, there is also contemplation on the non-being. Here, only very briefly, information has been given.20
Two types of bondage have been mentioned, Rāgabandha and Dveshabandha. This bondage has been mentioned only with reference to the Moheeya Karma. Rāga includes Māyā and Lobha, and Dvesha includes Krodha and Māna. In the Anguttara Nikaya, three types of communities have been considered - from Lobha, Dvesha and Moha. Among them, Moha is the most powerful.21 Thus, there is mention of two quantities. This vast world is made up of two elements. This vast chariot of creation is running on those two wheels. One element is conscious and the other element is inert. Jiva and Ajīva are the two masterminds of this world drama. In fact, their interaction is the world. On the day these two companions part ways, the world ends. From the perspective of one being, there is a severance of mutual relationship, but not from the perspective of all beings. Therefore, two types of quantities have been mentioned. In the second place, there is contemplation on the number two. Many of these sutras are found as they are in the Stananga also.
Third Samavāya: Analysis
In the third place, there is a description of three Danda, three Gupti, three Shalya, three Gaurav, three Viradhana, Mrigashira Pushya, etc. three stars, hell, and three Palyopama and three Sagaropama of the gods, and how many Bhavasiddhika beings will be liberated after three Bhavas, etc.
In the present Samavāya, there is mention of three Danda. Mind, speech and body attached to evil tendencies, these are the three Danda. They despise the wealth of character. The soul is punished. Therefore, they are called Danda. Mind, speech and
The tendency that is towards the world is Danda. Establishing the tendency of mind, speech and body in its path with Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnan is Gupti.22 There are three types of Gupti. Manogupti, Vachanagupti and Kayagupti. The meaning of Manogupti is to stop the mind that is active in the beginning, the middle and the end.23 In other words, to withdraw the mind from Kshayas like Raga-Dvesha, etc. is Manogupti. To refrain from false speech, etc. or to observe silence is Vachanagupti.24 False, harsh, self-praising words harm the minds of others, therefore such words should be restrained.25 Due to ignorance, many beings are killed by bodily actions. Therefore, opposing unskillful bodily activities is Kayagupti.26

Obstacles hinder the progress of sadhana. Obstacles cause suffering from within. Similarly, Maya, Nidana and Mithyadarshan distort sadhana, and the sadhak should avoid them. Pride and greed make the soul heavy and it considers itself glorious, but it is a distorted state of the mind inflamed by pride. From the perspective of sadhana, it is not glory but roarav, therefore the sadhak is advised to avoid all three types of glory. Knowledge, Darshan and Charitra are the three paths to liberation. They are also called Ratnatraya. Here, knowledge refers to Samyaggyan, which is preceded by Samyagdarshan. Due to Mithyadarshan, the jiva forgets its true nature and considers itself to be the material object. All its actions are dependent on the body. It practices religion for worldly fame, profit, etc. It does not have the discernment of self and other. But through Samyagdarshan, the sadhak gains true knowledge of self and other. 27 He overcomes the three defects of doubt, delusion and indecision and knows his true nature. 28 Knowing the true nature of the self is Samyaggyan from the perspective of certain vision. 29
Faith in the principles of Jiva, Ajeeva, Asrava, Bandha, Samvara, Nirjara and Moksha is Samyagdarshan. Samyagdarshan gives rise to the knowledge of what is real and what is unreal. Following the vows of non-violence, truth, etc. to purify the consequences of passions like raga, etc. is "Samyak Charitra". By contradicting these three, the sadhak deviates from sadhana. Thus, in the third place, taking the number three, many facts have been revealed.
Fourth Samavay: Analysis
The fourth place Samavay mentions four kshayas, four dhyanas, four vikathas, four sanjnas, four types of bandha, Anuradha, Purvashadha stars, four palyopama and sagaropama states of naraki and devas, and describes how many jivas go to liberation after four bhava.
1
What contaminates the consequences of the soul is kshaya. Kshaya destroys the natural nature of the soul. Kshayas are thieves who steal the wealth of the soul. They are the defects hidden in the soul. Anger, pride, Maya, greed are the four types of kshayas. They are called Chandala Chaukdi. Liberation from kshaya is true liberation. 'Kshayamukti: kil muktirev.' There are many varieties of kshaya. Kshaya is a karmic and also a karmic vikaric tendency. Abandoning that tendency and dwelling in the true nature of the self is the goal of the sadhak.
After kshaya, four dhyanas are mentioned. Dhyana means - focusing the mind on a subject (20 It is very difficult to focus the mind on a single point. It cannot remain focused for more than an antarmukhurta. 1 Acharya Shubhachandra has written that when the sadhak becomes absorbed in dhyana, he does not have dual knowledge. He rises above all raga-dvesha and becomes immersed in the true nature of the self. 22 In Tattvanushasan 23 it is called Samarsi Bhava and in Gyanarnava 24 it is called Sayiry Dhyana. Three things are mainly required for dhyana - dhyata, dhyeya and dhyana. 25 The one who meditates is dhyata. What is meditated upon is dhyeya, and the dhyata's becoming stable in the dhyeya is "dhyana". 25 For dhyana sadhana, it is necessary to renounce possessions, control passions, observe vows and conquer the senses. In Stananga 36, Bhagavati 37, Aavashyakaniyukti, etc., like Samavayanga, there are four dhyanas - Aart, Raudra, Dharma and Shukla.

Four types of meditation have been expounded. The first two are considered unrefined, while the last two are refined. Yoga texts discuss various types of meditation from different perspectives. However, we will not delve into those here, but will briefly contemplate the four types of meditation mentioned in the Agamas. 

Arta-dhyana is the meditation that arises from dukkha or suffering. It is caused by the separation from desirable objects and the association with undesirable objects. This meditation is characterized by a state of agitation in the mind due to attachment. As a result, the living being experiences suffering when it does not obtain the desired object and obtains the undesired object. The four types of Arta-dhyana are: undesirable association, separation from the desired, illness, and worry or illness and enjoyment. This meditation leads the living being to the state of Tiryancha. The mind of such a meditator is detached from the soul and focused on worldly objects.

Roudra-dhyana is the meditation in which the living being is naturally inclined to commit all kinds of sins. A cruel or harsh being is called Rudra. He becomes merciless and commits cruel acts. Therefore, it is called Roudra-dhyana. This meditation involves contemplation of violence, lying, stealing, protecting wealth, and piercing and breaking. The four types of this meditation are: delight in violence, delight in killing, delight in stealing, delight in protection, and delight in piercing and breaking. Therefore, both these meditations are considered despicable and inauspicious.

Dharma-dhyana is the first step in self-development. In this meditation, the practitioner engages in self-reflection. In the Jnanasar, it is stated that contemplation of the meaning of scriptures, Dharma-marganas, vows, secrecy, samiti, etc., is Dharma-dhyana. This meditation requires knowledge, perception, character, and detachment. These naturally stabilize the mind. Acharya Shubhachandra emphasized the contemplation of the four emotions of Maitri, Pramoda, Karuna, and Madhyastha for the attainment of Dharma-dhyana. Jinabhadragani Kshamashraman has clarified that the proper practice of Dharma-dhyana can be done in a secluded and peaceful place. The posture for meditation should be comfortable, so that the meditation can be sustained. This meditation can be done sitting in Padmasana, standing, or lying down. Due to mental restlessness, sometimes the practitioner's mind does not remain stable in meditation. Therefore, the scriptures have mentioned four supports for Dharma-dhyana:

1. **Agyavichay:** The words of the omniscient are free from any error. Therefore, taking the support of the words of the wise. Here, the word "vichay" means "contemplation."
2. **Apayavichay:** Contemplation for the destruction of karma and the attainment of the true nature of the soul.
3. **Vipaakavichay:** Contemplation on the auspicious and inauspicious fruits of karma, or contemplation on the processes that arise every moment due to the influence of karma.
4. **Sansthanavichay:** This world is characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence. From the perspective of substance, it is eternal, and from the perspective of modification, it undergoes creation and destruction. Contemplation on the eternal and non-eternal nature of the world strengthens the feeling of detachment, which leads to...

The seeker strives to experience the self-nature. Acharya Hemchandra, 48 Yogiindudev 49 Amitagati, 50 Acharya Haribhadra 51 Upadhyaya Yathovijaya etc. have described four objectives of Dharma Dhyana. They are: - (1) Pindastha (2) Padastha (3) Roopastha and (4) Roopateet. Pindastha Dhyana means to focus the mind on different parts of the body. Through the five Dharanas of Parthivee, Agneeyi, Maruti, Varuni and Tattvavati, the seeker gradually becomes absorbed in the center of the self. Practicing Pindastha Dhyana with four types of Dharanas stabilizes the mind. This helps to see the relationship between the body and karma differently. It involves contemplating the pure self-nature by destroying karma. The second, Padastha Dhyana, is the meditation done by taking recourse to mantras and letters according to one's liking. This meditation mainly involves sound as an object. Acharya Shubhachandra 52 has also called it Varnamaatrika Dhyana due to focusing on letters. In this meditation, the beautiful imagination of the navel lotus, heart lotus and mouth lotus is done. In the navel lotus, sixteen vowels are meditated upon on a lotus with sixteen petals. In the heart lotus, a lotus with twenty-four petals, including the stigma and petals, is imagined and the twenty-five classes of letters, starting with 'ka', 'kha', etc., are meditated upon. Similarly, eight letters are meditated upon on the mouth lotus. The best meditation among mantras and letters is considered to be 'Arhan', which is the king of mantras, containing the letter 'reph', the 'kala' and the 'bindu', along with the Anahata. 13 This king of mantras is meditated upon. Apart from these, many methods are described in detail in the texts like Yogashastra and Gyanarnava. In this meditation, the seeker tries to free himself from the lust of the senses and make the mind more pure and focused. The third meditation is "Roopastha". In this, the meditation is done on the omniscient Tirthankara Prabhu, who is free from the vices like attachment and aversion, and is endowed with all virtues. In this meditation, the practice of meditation is done by taking recourse to the nature of 'Ahanta'. 55 The fourth type of meditation is "Roopateet" Dhyana. Roopateet Dhyana means to remember the knowledge-filled, blissful form, which is beyond form and color, unstained and formless. 55 In this meditation, there is no difference between the meditator and the object of meditation. Therefore, Acharya Hemchandra has called this particular state 'Samarsi Bhaav'. 56 In these four types of Dharma Dhyana, the contemplation of the body, letters, omniscient and unstained Siddha is done respectively. It progresses from gross to subtle. Not all beings can do this meditation. Only the seeker is entitled to this meditation. When the mind becomes stable and pure through Dharma Dhyana, that seeker can become entitled to Shukla Dhyana in the future.

The fourth type of meditation is "Shukla" Dhyana. This is the most pure state of the soul. Based on the Shruta, the ultimate stability of the mind and the cessation of yoga is Shukla Dhyana. This meditation happens when the passions are pacified. Only that seeker can do this meditation who is absorbed in equanimity 57 and who is like Vajra-Rishabhanaraacha-Samhanan. 58

The text describes four types of Shukla Dhyana (meditation) in Jainism, outlining their increasing intensity from the perspective of Yoga:

(1) **Pṛthaktva-śruta-savicāra:** This meditation involves contemplation of the various aspects (paryāya) of a single substance (dravya) based on scriptural knowledge (śruta). The meditator shifts their focus between the meaning (artha), the word (śabda), and the physical postures (yoga), making it a "savicāra" (with thought) meditation.

(2) **Ekatva-śruta-avicāra:** This meditation, also based on scriptural knowledge, focuses on a single aspect (paryāya) without shifting between meaning, word, or posture. It is a "avicāra" (without thought) meditation. This type of meditation leads to the cessation of all passions (kaṣāya) and the destruction of the veils of knowledge (jñānāvaraṇa), perception (darśanāvaraṇa), delusion (mohaniya), and obstacles (antarāya), ultimately leading to the attainment of perfect knowledge (kevalajñāna) and perfect perception (kevaladarśana).

(3) **Sūkṣma-kriyā-pratipatti:** This meditation occurs when an Arhat (liberated soul) has only a very short lifespan remaining (less than a moment). To equalize the remaining karmas (actions), a process of "samudghāta" (equalization) takes place. This involves focusing on the subtle physical postures (sūkṣma kāya yoga) while suppressing the grosser mental (bādar mano yoga) and verbal (bādar vacana yoga) postures.

(4) **Utsanna-kriyā-pratipatti:** This meditation marks the cessation of even the subtle physical actions (sūkṣma kriyā) that remained in the previous stage. The Kevali (liberated soul) attains the state of "śaileśī" (supreme liberation) within the time it takes to pronounce five short vowels. They are completely liberated from all karmas.

After discussing the four types of meditation, the text mentions four types of "vikathā" (idle talk) that hinder spiritual progress. These are considered "āśrava" (influx) because they lead to the accumulation of karmas. Practitioners of "bhāṣāsamiti" (the practice of mindful speech) should avoid these types of talk.

The text also mentions that the Buddhist tradition also considers "vikathā" as "tiracchāna kathā" (unwholesome talk) and categorizes it into various types.

Page #33:
---------------------------
Vastrakatha, Shayanakatha, Malakatha, Gandhakatha, Jnathikatha, Yanakatha, Gramakatha, Nigamakatha, Nagarakatha, Janapadakatha, Streekatha etc. The present Samavaya mentions four Vikathas. In the Stananga, four types of each Vikatha are also mentioned. And in the seventh place, seven Vikathas are also mentioned.
After the Vikathas, four Sanjnas are mentioned. Generally, Abhilasha is called Sanjna. In other words, Asakti is Sanjna. Here, four types of Sanjna are described. In the Stanangasutra, four causes of the occurrence of each Sanjna are also mentioned. In the tenth place, ten types of Sanjna are also mentioned. We have already written about the four types of Bandha. In this way, the fourth Samavaya contains a wealth of material on Chintan. The fifth Samavaya: An Analysis
The fifth Samavaya mentions five Kriyas, five Mahavratas, five Kamagunas, five Ashravadwaras, five Sanvardwaras, five Nirjarasthanas, five Samitis, five Astikayas, five stars each of Rohini, Punarvasu, Hasta, Visakha, Dhanishtha constellations, five Palyopamas and five Sagaropama of Narakas and Devas, and five Bhavasiddhikas who know Bhava and Moksha.
First of all, Kriyas are mentioned. The meaning of Kriya is "Karan" and "Vyapaar". The "Kriyas" are the efforts that become the cause of Karmabandha. In other words, it can be said that the evil activities of mind, speech and body are called Kriya. Kriya is the root of Karmabandha. It is the mother of worldly birth and death. The tendency that causes the inflow of Karma is called Kriya. In the Stanangasutra, there is also a discussion of the types of Kriya, namely Jiva-Kriya, Ajeeva Kriya and then Jiva-Ajeeva Kriya. Here, mainly five Kriyas are mentioned. In the Prajnapanasutra, there is also a description of twenty-five Kriyas. The inquisitive should see those chapters. To be free from Kriyas, Mahavratas are described.
Mahavratas are the foundation of Shramanachar. The Agam literature has analyzed Mahavratas in detail. In the Agamas, three traditions of Mahavratas are found. In the Acharanga, three Mahavratas are mentioned, namely Ahimsa, Satya, Bahirdadan. In the Stananga, Uttaradhyayayana and Digha Nikaya, four Yamas are described. They are: Ahimsa, Satya, Achaurya and Bahirdadan. In Buddhist literature, Chaturyam is mentioned in many places. In the Sanvar Prakaran of the Prashnavyakaran, there is a discussion of Mahavratas. In the Dashavaikalikasutra, each Mahavrat is analyzed in detail.

Page #34:
---------------------------
To explain the nature of the Mahavrata, the Tattvarthasutra 79 and its nature are highlighted. What is called Mahavrata in Jain literature is called Dasha Kushala Dharma in Buddhist literature. They have included the Dasha Kushala Dharmas as follows:

Kushala Dharma
(1) Abstinence from Pranatipat and (9) Vyapada
(4) Mrishavaad (5) Pishunavachan (6) Parushavachan (7) Abstinence from Sampralaap (2) Abstinence from Adattadaan
(3) Abstinence from Mithyachar in Kama
(8) Abstinence from Amithya.

In the Bhagavati Sutra, in the commentary on Pratyakhyan, the Mahavrata are also mentioned:

Mahavrata
(1) Ahimsa
(2) Satya (3) Achaurya
(4) Brahmacharya
(5) Aparigraha

Ahimsa, Satya, Achaurya, Brahmacharya and Aparigraha, these five Mahavrata, by stopping the source of Asanaya, open the door to Sanaya. The sins of violence etc. are renounced for life in the three Karana and three Yoga. In the Mahavrata, the Savadya Yogas are completely renounced. Following the Mahavrata is like walking on the edge of a sharp sword. The one who is restrained avoids the sensual pleasures of the senses. He tries to destroy the karmas by stopping the Ashrava doors and through Samvara and Nirjara.

After this, the Shastrakar has mentioned five Samitis. Samyak Pravritti is called Samiti. 81 The desire of the Mumukhus is in the auspicious Yogas. It is also called Samiti. 82 The five, Iryasamiti etc., are called Samiti for this reason. After that, the Pancha Astikaya is described. Pancha Astikaya is the contribution of Jain philosophy. No other philosophy considers different substances as the medium of motion and rest. Vaisheshika philosophy has considered Utksepan etc. as Karma, not as substance. Jain philosophy has considered Dharma Astikaya as an independent substance for motion and Adharma Astikaya for rest. The Jain philosophy's belief about Akash is also special compared to other philosophies. Other philosophies have accepted Lokakash but not Alokakash. The belief in Alokakash is a special feature of Jain philosophy. The belief in Pudgal substance is also unique. Vaisheshika etc. philosophies believe in separate atomic species of earth etc. substances. But Jain philosophy includes earth etc. in one Pudgal substance. Each Pudgal atom has touch, taste, smell and form. Similarly, there are not separate species of these, but only one species. The atom of earth can change into the form of water and the atom of water can transform into fire. Similarly, Jain philosophy has also considered sound as Pudgalik.

Jain philosophy also has its own special belief regarding the Jiva. It considers the worldly soul as Swadehapariman. Apart from Jain philosophy, no other philosophy considers the soul as Swadehapariman.

In this way, the fifth Samavay reflects on various aspects related to Jain philosophy.

## The Sixth Samvaya: An Analysis

The Sixth Samvaya describes the six Leshyas, six Jivanikayas, six external austerities, six internal austerities, six Chadyasthika Samudghatas, six Arthaavagrahas, six stars each in the Kritika and Ashlesha constellations, six Palyopama and six Sagaropama conditions of Narakas and Devas, and how many beings will attain liberation after experiencing six Bhavas.

This Samvaya first mentions Leshyas.  Stanaanga 83, Uttaraadhyaayana 4, and Prajnaapana 85 elaborate on Leshyas.  After the Aagamyuga, the literature of the Darshanik Yuga also extensively discussed Leshyas.  Modern-day scientists are also contemplating them as Aabhamandalas.  Generally, a being generates a specific environment due to the influence of mental states like yoga and, more specifically, due to the influence of Kashayas.  This environment is called Leshya.  Uttaraadhyaayana uses the term "Purva Karma" for Leshya, meaning Karma-Shleshya.  The cause of Karma-bandha is the Karma-Leshya of emotions like Raga, etc.  Thus, Leshyas are of two types: Bhaava and Dravya.  Many Acharyas call the tendency towards Kashayas-influenced yoga as Leshya.  From this perspective, Leshya can only be present in a person with a false identity, but Shukla Leshya is also present in a Kevali who is in the 13th Gunasthana and is a Sayogi.  Therefore, some call the tendency towards yoga as Leshya.  Kashayas infuse intensity, etc., into it.  Acharya Jinadas Ganimahattar clearly stated that Leshyas cause the attachment of Karmas to the soul.  There have been different opinions among thinkers regarding Dravya Leshya.  According to many knowledgeable people, Dravya Leshya is made up of Karma-Paramanus.  However, it is different from the eight Karma-Anus.  According to others, Dravya Leshya is in the form of a bound Karma flow.  According to a third opinion, it is an independent Dravya.

This Samvaya also mentions six external austerities and six internal austerities.  The first external austerity is Anashan Tapa, which is more severe than other austerities.  Anashan purifies the body and mind.  Like Agni-snaan, it removes Karma-mal and makes the soul, which is like gold, shine.  The second external austerity is Unodari.  It is also called Avamoudarya.  In Dravya Unodari, the amount of food is reduced, and in Bhaava Unodari, the amount of Kashayas is reduced.  Dravya Unodari keeps the body healthy, and Bhaava Unodari develops internal qualities.  Searching for food by acquiring various things is called Bhikshachari.  There are many sub-categories of Bhikshachari.  A Bhikshu has to avoid many faults while accepting alms.  The taste that makes one feel happy about food is called Rasa.  Sweet, etc., Rasas make food delicious.  Rasas are stimulating.  A Sadhak takes food according to his needs, but not for taste!  Sucking and chewing food for taste is a fault.  Avoiding these faults of Rasa is called Rasaparityaag.  Causing pain to the body is called Kayaklesh.  A Sadhak considers the soul and body as separate.  Acharya Bhadrabahu

It has been said that this body is different, the soul is different. The seeker, with this kind of knowledge of the elements, renounces the attachment to the body which gives rise to sorrow and distress. 81 In the **Stanaanga**, it is said that **Kayotsarga**, meditation with intense concentration, holding an image, etc., are many types of bodily austerities. 10 Thus, there are fourteen types of bodily austerities. 61 The process of making the soul, which is immersed in the external, immersed in its own nature, is called **Prati-sanleena**. In the **Bhaagvati**, 62 it is said that there are four types of **Prati-sanleena**: **Indriya-prati-sanleena**, **Kashaya-prati-sanleena**, **Yoga-prati-sanleena**, and **Vivikta-shayana-asana-sevana**. There are six external austerities. 93
44
There are six internal austerities. The first is **Prayashchitta**. According to Acharya Akalanka, the word "**Praya**" means offense, and "**Chitta**" means purification. The action that purifies the offense is **Prayashchitta**. 14 **Prayashchitta** cuts off sin. It removes sin. 95 There is a difference between **Prayashchitta** and punishment. **Prayashchitta** is undertaken voluntarily. Punishment is not taken with remorse for the sin, it is taken out of compulsion. In the **Stanaanga**, ten types of **Prayashchitta** are mentioned. **Vinaya** is the second internal austerity. It is a spiritual quality. The word **Vinaya** encompasses three meanings: discipline, self-control, good conduct, and humility. **Vinaya** removes the eight karmas. In the **Pravachana-sara-uddhar**, it is written that **Vinaya** is that which removes the eight karmas, which are the enemies that give rise to distress. 96 In the **Bhaagvati**, 97 the **Stanaanga**, 18 the **Aupapatik**, 19 seven types of **Vinaya** are mentioned: **Jnana-vinaya**, **Darshan-vinaya**, **Charitra-vinaya**, **Mano-vinaya**, **Vachan-vinaya**, **Kaya-vinaya**, and **Lokopachara-vinaya**. **Vinaya** is not flattery, it is natural respect for good qualities. **Vyayavritta** austerity is to serve those things that lead to the practice of Dharma. In the **Bhaagvati**, 100 ten types of **Vyayavritta** are mentioned. The study of the scriptures with proper methods is **Swadhyaya** austerity. 101 Self-reflection and contemplation are also **Swadhyaya**. Just as food is necessary for the body, so too is study necessary for the development of the intellect. The Vedic sages 102 also said, "**Tapo hi Swadhyaya**," and they gave the inspiration that one should never be negligent in **Swadhyaya**. 103 Acharya Patanjali says that through **Swadhyaya**, one begins to see the Ishta Devata directly. Five types of **Swadhyaya** are mentioned: **Vachana**, **Pricchana**, **Parivartana**, **Anupreksha**, and **Dharmakatha**. 104 The state of concentration of the mind

**Meditation**

Meditation is the state of the soul being absorbed in its own nature, detached from external objects. **Vyuutsarga** is a specific type of **utsarga**. Acharya Akalank'05 defines **vyuutsarga** as the state of being free from attachment, non-attachment, fearlessness, and the abandonment of the desire for life. **Vyuutsarga** is the method of surrendering oneself to self-realization. There are four types of **vyuutsarga**: **ganavyuutsarga**, **sharirvayuutsarga**, **upadhivyuutsarga**, and **bhaktapanavyuutsarga**. 06 **Sharirvayuutsarga** is also known as **kayoutsarga**. Bhagwan Mahavira called the seeker "**abhikkhanam kaoussagkari**" - one who repeatedly performs **kayoutsarga**. The seeker who becomes proficient in **kayoutsarga** becomes proficient in all **vyuutsarga** austerities. The scriptures have highlighted the nature of Jain austerities through external and internal austerities. Thus, the sixth **samavay** discusses various topics.

**Seventh Samavay: An Analysis**

The seventh **samavay** discusses seven types of fear, seven types of **samudghat**, Bhagwan Mahavira's seven-hand-high body, seven **vardhadhar** mountains in Jambudvipa, seven islands, seven karmas causing pain in the twelfth **gunasthan**, seven stars and constellations of Magha, Krittika, etc. It mentions seven **palyopam** and seven **sagaropama** states of narakas and devas. It first describes seven fears: **ihlokabhay**, **paralokabhay**, **adanabhay**, **akasmatbhay**, **ajivicabhay**, **maranabhay**, and **ashlokabhay**. In the past, fear of heterodox beings was greater. But today, scientific villains have instilled so much fear in the human mind that even great national leaders' hearts are pounding with fear of when the atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb will explode, or when World War III will break out! Just as the Jain Agam literature mentions **bhayasthan**, Buddhist literature also mentions **bhayasthan**. 07 There, they describe various types of fear: fear of caste-birth, old age, disease, death, fire, water, king, thief, **atmanuvaad** - the thought of one's own misconduct, **paranuvaadabhay** - the fear that others will call me a wrongdoer, etc. Thus, the seventh **samavay** describes this.

**Eighth Samavay: An Analysis**

The eighth **samavay** discusses eight **madasthan**, eight **pravachanamata**, eight **yojan** high **chaitavriksh** of **vanavyantar** devas, etc., eight times of **kevali samudghat**, eight **ganadhar** of Bhagwan Parshva, eight constellations of the moon, eight **palyopam** and **sagaropama** states of narakas and devas, and those who attain liberation through eight **bhav**.

First, it describes **jatimand**, **kulmand**, etc. **mad**. Like **samayavang**, **sthanaang**108 also mentions eight **mad**. **Aavashyakasutra** advises the seeker to be free from these eight **mad**. **Sutrakritang**09 clearly instructs that ego makes a person disrespect others, causing him to wander in the world. Bhagwan Mahavira's soul had **jati** and **kul** **mad** in the **marichi** **bhav**, resulting in his birth in the womb of Devananda. Therefore, one should avoid **madasthan**. **Anguttaranikaya**110 mentions three types of **mad**.105. **Tattvarthrajavartika**, 9/26/10 106. **Bhagavati** 25/7 107. **Anguttaranikaya** 4/119/5-7 108. **Sthanaang** sth. 8 109. **Sutrakritang**-1/2/1-2 110. **Anguttaranikaya**-3/39

Youth, health and vitality. After the praise, the description of the eight Pravachanmatas is given. The twenty-fourth study of Uttaradhyayanasutra is famous by the name of Pravachanmata. They are also called Pravachanmata in Bhagavati Sutra 11 and Stananga 112. All twelve angas are included in these eight Pravachanmatas.213 These Pravachanmatas are in the form of character. Without character, there is no knowledge, no vision.214 The twelve angas contain a detailed description of knowledge, vision and character. Therefore, the twelve angas are the vast form of Pravachanmata. The dignity of a mother is unparalleled in worldly life. Similarly, these eight Pravachanmatas are the Jagadamba of the spiritual world.15 The benefit of these eight Pravachanmatas in spiritual life is infinite times greater than the benefit of a mother in worldly life. By following them properly, the seeker becomes free from karma. Modern historians consider Lord Parshva to be a historical figure.16 The names of the eight main disciples of Lord Parshva are also mentioned in it. In this way, the eighth Samavay contains a collection of thought-provoking material.
Ninth Samavay: An Analysis
The ninth Samavay describes the nine secrets of celibacy, the study of nine celibacies, Lord Parshva was nine hands high, the Abhijit constellation, etc., the Sudharma assembly of Ratnaprabha, Vanavyantar Devas is nine yojanas high, the nine natures of Darshanavaran karma, the nine palyopama and nine sagaropama of Narakas and Devas, and the nine bhava karmas of those who go to moksha.
First of all, the nine secrets of celibacy are mentioned in this Samavay. The means and methods that the Lord has called samadhi and mukti for the protection of celibacy are called bad in the vernacular. Just as a gardener builds a fence of thorns to protect the plants in his garden, similarly, a fence is absolutely necessary in the field of sadhana to protect the celibacy plant. The glory and dignity of celibacy is unparalleled. "Tam Bham Bhagavanta"117 Just as the Tirthankaras are the best among all the Shramans, similarly, celibacy is the greatest among all the vows. The seeker who has fully worshipped one celibacy has worshipped all the vows. A scholar has written "Bastiindriyamansamupashmo Brahmacharyam". Celibacy is called the peace of the generative organ, the group of senses and the mind. The word Brahma has three main meanings - semen, soul and knowledge. The word Charya also has three meanings - Charya, protection and Raman! In this way, there are three meanings of celibacy. Celibacy purifies the soul. Acharya Patanjali has written - Brahmacharyapratisthayan Atmalabha:118 By fully practicing celibacy, one gets unparalleled mental power and physical strength. According to Atharvaveda 19, celibacy leads to the attainment of brilliance, patience, courage and knowledge. In this way, celibacy leads to the development of all three types of spiritual, mental and physical. A beautiful description of the samadhisthan and asamadhisthan of celibacy is found in Uttaradhyayanasutra 12° and also in Buddhist texts.

The description is similar to 121. This description is very useful for the ascetics who practice celibacy. Lord Parshva's body was nine hands tall. This historical description is also important. In this way, the subjects are presented in the ninth Samvaya.

The Tenth Samvaya: An Analysis

The tenth Samvaya mentions the ten virtues of an ascetic, the ten stages of citta-samadhi, Mount Sumeru's base being ten thousand yojanas in diameter, Lord Arishtanemi, Krishna Vasudeva, Baldeva being ten bows tall, the ten knowledge-enhancing stars, the ten Kalpa trees, the ten thousand Narakas and Devas, the state of ten Palya-upamas and ten Sagara-upamas, and the statement of beings who take ten births and attain liberation.

The first mention in this Samvaya is of the virtues of an ascetic. One does not become an ascetic merely by changing clothes. One becomes an ascetic by adopting virtues. Here, the scholar has mentioned the real life of an ascetic. The life of an ascetic should be fragrant with these ten virtues. The ascetic who adopts these virtues can attain citta-samadhi. Here, ten types of citta-samadhi are mentioned. In Dasashrutaskandha 122, the state of samadhi is also mentioned. Samadhi is that which gives a feeling of mental well-being, and asamadhi is that which gives a feeling of distress in the mind. Here, ten states of samadhi are mentioned, while in Dasha Vaikalika 123, four states of samadhi are mentioned - Vinaya samadhi, Shruta samadhi, Tapa samadhi and Achar samadhi. The ten types of samadhi mentioned here can be included in Achar samadhi. In the study of Samadhi in Sutra Kritanga Sutra 124, the commentator Bhadrabahu 125 has briefly mentioned Darshan, Gyan, Tapa and Charitra as samadhi. The word samadhi has been used many times in the Buddhist tradition as well. There, the meaning of samadhi is the concentration of "citta", i.e. establishing the citta in one object. 126 Samadhi is the eighth path in Buddha's Eightfold Path 127. The texts of the Yoga tradition have elaborated on samadhi. Acharya Patanjali 128 has mentioned samadhi along with dhyana and dharana in the third Vibhutipada. Samadhi is the last in Ashtanga Yoga 129. Tapa, Swadhyaya, Ishwarpranidhan are included in Kriya Yoga. Kriya Yoga suppresses the senses. Through continuous practice of Abhyasa and Vairagya, the ascetic attains Samadhi Yoga. Samadhi Shataka is an important work of Acharya Pujyapada 130. It contains methods of recognizing the self through meditation and samadhi. In this way, the tenth Samvaya contains a collection of important material.

## The Eleventh Samvaya: An Analysis

The Eleventh Samvaya describes eleven Upasaka Pratimas, eleven Ganadharas of Bhagwan Mahavira, eleven stars of the Mula Nakshatra, eleven Palyopama and Sagaropama states of Graveyaka, Naraka and Devas, and eleven Bhava states leading to Moksha.

This Samvaya first mentions the Shravaka Pratimas. Pratimas refer to specific vows, specific observances, specific austerities, and specific acquisitions. After accepting the twelve vows, a Shravaka adopts the Pratimas. There are slight differences in the number, order, and names of Pratimas in the Svetambara and Digambara texts, but these differences are negligible. Their names are found in Upasakadashaanga, Dasha Shruta Skandha, and Samvayanga. They are: 1. Darshan, 2. Vrat, 3. Samayik, 4. Paushdhopavas, 5. Niyam, 6. Brahmacharya, 7. Sachittatyaga, 8. Aarambh Tyaga, 9. Preshya Parityaag, 10. Uddishta Tyaga, and 11. Shramanabhoot. Acharya Haribhadra mentions 'Sthan' instead of 'Niyam' as the fifth Pratima. Digambara texts like Vasunandi Shravakaachar, etc., mention eleven Pratimas: Darshan, Vrat, Samayik, Paushd, Sachittatyaga, Ratribhuktittyaga, Brahmacharya, Aarambh Tyaga, Parigraha Tyaga, Anumati Tyaga, and Uddishta Tyaga.  Swamikartikeyaanupreksha mentions twelve Pratimas, including Samyagdristi. Both traditions agree on the first four Pratimas. Sachittatyaga is the fifth Pratima in the Digambara tradition, while it is the seventh in the Svetambara tradition. The Digambara tradition considers Ratribhuktittyaga as a separate Pratima, while the Svetambara tradition includes it in the fifth Pratima, Niyam. The Digambara tradition mentions Anumati Tyaga as the tenth Pratima, while the Svetambara tradition includes it in Uddishta Tyaga. This is because in this Pratima, the Shravaka does not accept Uddishta Bhakti and also does not support other Aarambhas. The Shramanabhoot Pratima in the Svetambara tradition is called Uddishta Tyaga Pratima in the Digambara tradition because it involves a Shravaka.

It is noteworthy that Acharya Umaswati has described Vrat and its transgressions in Tattvarth Sutra. However, he has not mentioned anything about Pratimas. All Svetambara and Digambara commentators of Tattvarth Sutra have not mentioned anything about Pratimas. Similarly, Pujyapada, Ankalank, Vidyānandin, etc., of the Digambara tradition have not mentioned anything about Pratimas.

Shivakoti139, Ravishena140, Jatasimhanandi141, Jinasena142, Padmanandi143, Devasena144, Amritachandra145 and others have certainly written about the vows of the Shravaks, but they have remained silent about the images. The other tradition is of such Acharyas who not only mentioned the images but also discussed their form in detail. Among them, the names of Acharya Samantabhadra146, Somdeva147, Amitagati148, Vasunandi149, Pandit Ashadhara150, Medhavi151, Sakalkirti152 and others can be taken.

The Shravak who has a good knowledge of the nine principles can adopt the image. Without the knowledge of the nine principles, the proper observance of the images is not possible. Some thinkers are of the opinion that in the first image, one should observe a fast for one day and take the Parana on the next day, in the second image, take the Parana in small portions, and in this way, up to the eleventh image, one should observe penance and take the Parana. But the statement of these thinkers is not substantiated by any Agama and later texts. In the Upasakadashanga Sutra, the Shravaks like Ananda etc. had certainly observed penance at the time of worshipping the images. But there is no clear instruction that only this much penance should be done.

Some thinkers also believe that in the present time, no Shravak can worship the images. Just as the Bhikshus have given up the images, the Shravaks have also given up the images. The view of these thinkers is worth considering. Perhaps the compulsory condition of fasting penance along with the images is the basis of this view. According to the Digambara tradition, the observance of Shravak-images is for life, while in the Shvetambara tradition, their time limit is fixed at one, two up to eleven months. Even today, there are Shravaks who observe the images in the Digambara tradition.

In this way, various subjects have been presented in the eleventh Samvaya. Twelfth Samvaya: An Analysis
- In the twelfth Samvaya, twelve Bhikshu images, twelve Sambhoga, twelve cycles of Kritikarm, the dimension of Vijaya capital as twelve lakh Yojana Vishkambha have been described. The age of Maryada-Purushottama Rama has been stated as twelve hundred years. It has been said that the Ratrimana and Sarvarthasiddha Vimana are twelve Yojana above the Ishatpragbhara earth, and the Naraka and Devas have twelve Palya-upama and twelve...

---------------------------
This text discusses the state of Sagaropama and the twelve Bhavas that lead to liberation, mentioning the twelve types of Bhikshu Pratimas.

The text first mentions the twelve Bhikshu Pratimas, which are described in detail in the Sthananga Sutra 53. These include Samadhi Pratimas (divided into Shruta Samadhi and Charitra Samadhi) and Upadhana Pratimas, which include the twelve Bhikshu Pratimas. The text also mentions Vivek Pratimas, Vyutsarga Pratimas, Bhadra, Subhadra, Maha Bhadra, and Sarvato Bhadra Pratimas, each with their own variations. However, the twelve Bhikshu Pratimas mentioned here can only be attained by Bhikshus who possess specific Sanhanan and Shruta.

The term "Samyoga" is used here in a technical sense, referring to the practice of living together with other Shramans who share similar views, following the rules of Vinaya and Vyavavritti in terms of food, clothing, utensils, exchange, initiation, and Paryaya. The two verses on Samyoga in this text are found in the Nisitha Bhashya 54, where they are discussed in detail.

The twelve types of Samyoga are:

1. **Upadhi:** This refers to the acceptance of clothing and utensils. As long as these are accepted purely, the Samyoga with other Shramans can continue. If a Bhikshu accepts them with defects and repents upon being told, he remains Samyogarha. He can be forgiven three times. If he accepts them for the fourth time, he should be separated from the community, even if he repents. Similarly, a Pasvastha or Sanayati who is separated from the community can be forgiven three times for seeking pure or impure Upadhi. After that, he is considered Visamyogarha. The same principle applies to the use and consumption of Upadhi.

2. **Shruta:** This refers to the transmission of knowledge. A Shraman who has been initiated from the same or another Gachcha can receive Shruta according to the proper procedure. If a Shraman transmits Shruta improperly to a Samyogic, initiated, or uninitiated person, he can be forgiven three times. After that, even if he repents, he is considered Visamyogarha.

3. **Bhaktapan:** As long as a Shraman follows the rules of accepting food and drink, he remains Samyogic. The same principle applies here as with Upadhi.

4. **Anjali Pragraha:** It is appropriate to greet Samyogic and Asamyogic Shramans with folded hands, but not Pasvasthas. A Bhikshu who does this can be forgiven three times.

The text further explains other types of Samyoga, including Dan, Nikachana, Abhyutthan, Kritikarma, Vyavavrittikaran, Samavasaran, and Sanishidya Kathaprabandha. The editor has provided a good explanation of these terms. Therefore, refer to the original text for further details.

The text then mentions the twelve cycles of Kritikarma. However, the explanation in the text is not as clear as it should be. The same topic is discussed in the Aavashyak Niyukti 57, where it is explained in detail. The text states that if someone performs the Vandana with the twenty-five Aavashyakas, they attain Parinirvana or become a Vimana Vasi Deva.

The text concludes with a verse on the Vandana of the Sadguru: "I wish to forgive the Shramans, I will bow down to them, I will follow their teachings, I will accept their guidance, I will follow their path, I will be free from all impurities, I will be blessed with many virtues, I will have a good day."

"What is it? Is it a bow, or is it a salutation?" This question is asked twice in the text. The meaning of the text from "I wish to bow to you, free from sin" to "My humble obeisance" is - I wish to bow to you, free from sin. Therefore, please grant me space, or permission to enter. This text indicates the act of requesting permission to enter. In the present text, one must bow their body halfway until the word "Anujanaha". This is one bow. And when one bows again as before, that is the second bow. Thus, there are two salutations in the ritual act. When a child receives initiation or is born, they have this posture - they hold both hands on their head. This is called "Yathajat". The posture should be "Yathajat" while bowing. Upon receiving permission to enter the space, sit in the "Ubhradak" posture, extend both hands towards the Guru, and touch the Guru's feet with both hands. In the text "Ahokayam", the letter "A" should be pronounced softly. From there, take the hands and touch the middle part of the head while pronouncing the letter "Ho" loudly. Thus, one cycle is completed in the pronunciation of the word "Aho". Similarly, one cycle should be completed in the pronunciation of the word "Kayam". In the same way, one cycle should be completed in the pronunciation of "Kayasamphasan" while pronouncing "Kay". Thus, these are three cycles. After that, in "Jatta Bhe", the letter "J" should be pronounced softly and the Guru's feet should be touched with the hand. And while pronouncing "Tta" with a medium voice, the hands should be removed from the Guru's feet and placed on the "Adhar".
And while pronouncing the letter "Bhe" loudly, the middle part of the head should be touched with the hand. This is one cycle. Similarly, while pronouncing the letters "J", "V", "Ni", and while pronouncing the letters "Jn", "Ch", "Bhe", the third cycle should be completed. Thus, there are six cycles in total in one salutation. There are also six cycles in the second salutation. Thus, there are twelve cycles in the ritual act.
After entering the space, during the "Kshamna", both the disciple and the Acharya perform two "Shironaman" together, and similarly, two "Shironaman" are performed during the second salutation. Thus, there are four "Shironaman". When the disciple bows, the mind, speech, and body should be controlled. These are the three "Gupti". During the first salutation, one enters the "Avgrahayachana", and similarly, during the second salutation as well. Thus, these are two entrances. After performing the first salutation with the necessary actions, exiting from the space is called "Nishkraman". This is only one. In the second salutation, one does not exit but remains at the Guru's feet and completes the sutra. These are the twenty-five essentials of the salutation.
Thus, in this present "Samavay", like the previous "Samavays", there is a beautiful collection of knowledge-enhancing material. The thirteenth and fourteenth "Samavays": An analysis
In the thirteenth "Samavay", there are thirteen places of action, "Soudharm", thirteen "Viman" in "Ishankalp", thirteen "Vastu" named "Pranayu" in the twelfth "Purva", thirteen types of "Yog" in "Garbhaj Tiryanch", "Panchendriya", thirteen "Palyopama" and thirteen "Sagaropama" positions of the Sun's sphere, Narakas, and Devas. The details regarding action, etc., have been written extensively on the previous pages.
In the fourteenth "Samavay", there are fourteen "Bhootgram", fourteen "Purva", fourteen thousand "Shraman" of Bhagwan Mahavira, fourteen "Jivasthan", fourteen "Ratna" of the "Chakravarti", fourteen great rivers, fourteen "Palyopama" and fourteen "Sagaropama" positions of Narakas and Devas, along with a description of the fourteen "Bhav" through which beings go to liberation.
Here, first of all, fourteen "Bhootgram" are mentioned. "Bhoot" means beings and "Gram" means group, i.e., 158. "Sthananga-Samavayanga", pp. 810-812 - Pt. Dalsukh Malvaniya
[40]

---------------------------
A group of living beings is called a Bhutgram. Like Samavayanga, these distinctions are also mentioned in Bhagavati Sutra 159. Among these, seven are insufficient and seven are sufficient. Food, body, senses, breathing, language, and mind are the six sufficient things. In earth etc. one-sense beings, there are four sufficient things. In two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, non-cognizant five-sense, and cognizant human beings, there are five sufficient things. In cognizant Tiryanch, human, hell, and god, there are six sufficient things. The state of a being is insufficient until it has fulfilled all the sufficient things possible for it, and it is sufficient when it has fulfilled them. In this way, fourteen types have been made by combining sufficient and insufficient. After this, there is a mention of fourteen Purvas. Purva Shruta is an infinite storehouse of knowledge. It is extremely unfortunate that this storehouse was destroyed after the death of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira due to a terrible twelve-year famine and due to memory weakness etc. After that, there is a mention of fourteen Jeevasthanas. Jeevasthan is called 'Gunasthan' in Samyasar 160, Prakrit Panchasangrah 161, and Karmagranth 162. Acharya Nemichandra 163 has called living beings as Gunas. The fourteen Jeevasthanas are born from the states of arising, subsidence, destruction, destruction-subsidence, etc. of karmas. By treating the result and the resultant as inseparable, Jeevasthan is called Gunasthan. In Gommatasar 164, Gunasthan is called Jeeva-Samas. The qualities that arise from the arising of karma are Audayik. The qualities that arise from the subsidence of karma are Aupashimik. The qualities that arise from the destruction-subsidence of karma are Kshayopaashimik. The qualities that arise from the destruction of karma are Kshayik. The qualities that are found naturally without the arising, subsidence, destruction, destruction-subsidence of karma are Parinaamik. Due to these qualities, the living being is also called a Guna. Jeevasthan is called Gunasthan in the literature after Samavayanga. Acharya Nemichandra 166 has considered Sanksepa and Ogha as two synonyms of Gunasthan. Those who are described as fourteen Jeevasthanas in Karmagranth 167 are called fourteen Bhutgrams in Samavay. Those who are called Gunasthan in Karmagranth are called Jeevasthan in Samavay. Thus, there is a difference in name between Karmagranth and Samavay, but not in meaning. In Samavayanga, the basis of the creation of Jeevasthanas is described as karma-purity. Acharya Abhaydev 168 has described Gunasthanas as arising from the purity of Mohaniya karmas. Nemichandra 169 has written - the first four Gunasthanas are due to the arising etc. of Darshanmoha, and the next eight Gunasthanas are born from the destruction-subsidence etc. of Charitramoha. The remaining two are due to the presence and absence of Yoga. Here, the nature of Gunasthanas has been highlighted in brief. In this way, the fourteenth Samavay is a combination of very useful material. The fifteenth and sixteenth Samavay: An Analysis

The description of the stay of six constellations with the moon for fifteen Muhurtas, the day and night being fifteen Muhurtas each in the months of Chaitra and Ashwin, fifteen Arthaadhikars before Vidyaanuvaad, fifteen types of uses of humans, and the condition of fifteen Palyopama and Sagaropama of Narakas and Devas.
In the sixteenth Samavay, sixteen studies of the first Shruta Skandha of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra have been said. Sixteen Kashayas are Anantanu bandhi etc. Sixteen names of Mount Meru, sixteen thousand Shramans of Bhagwan Parshva, sixteen Adhikars before Atma Pravaad, sixteen thousand Yojanas of the dimension of the capital of Chamarchancha and Balichancha, sixteen Palyopama and sixteen Sagaropama of Narakas and Devas, and the description of sixteen Bhavas and the beings going to Moksha.
In the present Samavay, information about the studies of the second Anga Sutra Kritanga has been given. Sutra Kritanga has a glorious place from the point of view of the philosophical Agam. In which the refutation of Paramat and the adornment of Swamat has been done. Sutra Kritanga can be compared to the Abhidhamma Pitaka of the Buddhist tradition, in which Buddha refuted sixty-two opinions prevalent in his time and established his own opinion. In the present Samavay, sixteen thousand Shramans of Bhagwan Parshva have been mentioned from a historical point of view. In this way, the present Samavay has a separate importance. Seventeenth and Eighteenth Samavay: An Analysis
In the seventeenth Samavay, seventeen types of Sanjam and Asanjam, the height of the Manushottar mountain etc., seventeen types of death, the bondage of seventeen Karma Prakritis in the tenth Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan, and the description of seventeen Bhavas and the beings going to Moksha by describing the condition of seventeen Palyopama and Sagaropama of Narakas and Devas.
First of all, there is a discussion of Sanjam and Asanjam. Sanjam and Asanjam have been discussed in many places in Agam literature. In Stananga Sutra 170, the differences between Sanjam and Asanjam have been propounded at various places. In fact, doing something with effort, not doing anything without effort, or abstaining from doing anything, and controlling one's senses and mind is called Sanjam. Four types of Sanjam - Man, Vachan, Kay and Upakaran Sanjam. There are also five, seven, eight, ten types of Sanjam. Similarly, there are types of Asanjam. From the point of view of the types of Sanjam, there are two types of Sanjam - Sarag Sanjam and Vitrag Sanjam. All those types of Sanjam have been described from different perspectives. Sanjam is the lifeblood of Sadhana. Sanjam is such a melodious music whose melodious sound waves make the life of the Sadhak attain supreme bliss. In the present Samavay, seventeen types of death have been told. The being who takes birth, he must surely embrace death. The fruit that has blossomed must surely wither. It is a burning truth that death is inevitable. All the great philosophers have thought about death. In Stananga 171, three types of death - Balamaran, Panditamaran and Balapanditmaran have been made and three sub-types of each have been made. In Bhagwati 172, five types - Avichmmaran, Avadhimmaran, Atyantikmaran, Balamaran, Panditamaran have been told. In Uttaradhyayanasutra 173, there is a description of Akam and Sakam death. Here, seventeen types of death have been told. In which all types of death are included. In this way, various topics have been described in the seventeenth Samavay. 170. Stananga Sutra-429, 368, 521; 614, 715, 430: 72, 310, 428, 517, 647, 709 etc. 171. Stanangasutra-Sutra 222 172. Bhagvatisutra-Shatak-13, Udde. 7, Su. 496 173. Uttaradhyayanasutra A-5

The eighteenth Samavaya describes eighteen types of Brahmacharya, eighteen thousand Shramanas of Arhant Arishtanemi, eighteen places of Sakshudrak Vyakt Shramanas, eighteen thousand verses of Acharang Sutra in eighteen types of Brahmi script, eighteen Adhikaras of Asti-Nast-Pravad-Purva, eighteen Muhurta in Paush and Ashadh months, day and night, the state of Narakas and Devas in eighteen Palyopama and Sagaropama, and the description of eighteen Bhavas and the beings who go to Moksha.
The description of Brahmacharya etc. in this Samavaya has been discussed in the previous pages. It describes different types of bodies in relation to Audarik etc. The mention of eighteen thousand Shramanas of Bhagwan Arishtanemi is historically significant. 74 Karmayogi Shri Krishna has been considered a historical figure by historians. Therefore, there is no obstacle in considering Bhagwan Arishtanemi, who lived in that era, as a historical figure. See the introduction of Jnatasutra for Brahmi script. 275 This is how the material is compiled in the eighteenth Samavaya.
Nineteenth and Twentieth Samavaya: An Analysis
The nineteenth Samavaya describes nineteen studies of the first Shruta Skandha of Jnatasutra, the Sun of Jambudweep heats the area of nineteen hundred Yojanas. Shakra sets with nineteen Nakshatras. Nineteen Tirthankaras were initiated. Nineteen Palyopama and Sagaropama states of Narakas and Devas. In the Stananga Sutra 176, Vasupujya, Malli, Arishtanemi, Parsva and Mahavira took initiation in their childhood. Acharya Abhaydev has interpreted Kumaravas as those who did not rule. This Sutra also interprets "Agaravasamjhe Vasitta" as taking initiation after ruling for a long time. From the perspective of the Digambar tradition, Kumaravas means "bachelor". And they consider all five as Balbrahmacharis. The remaining nineteen Tirthankaras were crowned. Out of them, three Tirthankaras were also Chakravartis. Niyuktikar 77 has also indicated that five Tirthankaras took Pravrajya in their first age and nineteen Tirthankaras in their middle age. According to Kalpasutra 178 and other Shwetambar texts, Bhagwan Mahavira was married. Therefore, the Necessary Niyuktikar, the second Bhadrabahu, considers Bhagwan Mahavira to be married. This is the description in the nineteenth Samavaya.
The twentieth Samavaya describes twenty Asamadhi Sthanas, twenty Dhanush height of Muni Suvrat Arhat, twenty thousand Yojanas thickness of Ghanodadhi Vatavalaya, twenty thousand Samanik Devas of Pranat Devendra, twenty Artha Adhikaras of Pratyakhyan Purva and twenty Kotakoti Sagaropama as Kalchakra. It describes the state of some Narakas and Devas in twenty Palyopama and Sagaropama. Those actions that cause distress in one's own mind or in the minds of others are Asamadhi Sthanas. We have already shed light on Samadhi.
Twenty-first and Twenty-second Samavaya: An Analysis

The twenty-first nature is said to be the essence. The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth periods of the descending cycle and the first and second periods of the ascending cycle are each twenty-one thousand years long. The twenty-one Palyopam and Sagropam states of the Narakas and Devas are described. Here, "Shabal" means corrupted, stained or deformed by blemishes, which actions defile the character, they are Shabal. These defects are also described in the Dasha Shruta Skandha. Thus, the twenty-first Samavay hints at avoiding defects and also contains some historical material.

The twenty-second Samavay describes twenty-two Parishahs, twenty-two Sutras of Dristivad, twenty-two types of Pudgal, and the twenty-two Palyopam and twenty-two Sagropam states of the Narakas and Devas.

This Samavay describes twenty-two types of Parishahs. The Bhagavati Sutra 179 and the Uttaradhyayanasutra 180 describe Parishahs in detail. Parishah is a test. For a seed to germinate, it needs not only water but also scorching sunlight. Similarly, the heat of Parishah is also necessary to refine the practice. When Parishah comes, the practitioner does not panic. Instead, he thinks that he has got a golden opportunity to test himself. According to Uttaradhyayanasutra 81, the Parishahs are quoted from the seventeenth Prabhrit of the Karma Pravad, which is part of the study. The Tattvarth Sutra 182 also describes the Parishahs.

The twenty-third and twenty-fourth Samavays: An Analysis

The twenty-third Samavay describes twenty-three studies of the Sutra Kritanga, the twenty-three Tirthankaras of Jambudvipa attaining Kevalgyan at sunrise, except for Bhagwan Rishabhdev, who knew the eleven Angas in his previous birth. Rishabh's Jiva knew the fourteen previous births. The twenty-three Tirthankaras were Mandalik Rajas in their previous births. Rishabh was a Chakravarti. The twenty-three Palyopam and Sagropam states of the Narakas and Devas are described. Here, the sixteen studies of the first Shruta Skandha and the seven studies of the second Shruta Skandha of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra are combined to make a total of twenty-three studies. This Samavay states that the twenty-three Tirthankaras attained Kevalgyan at sunrise. In the Aavashyak Niyukti 183, the first twenty-three Tirthankaras attained Kevalgyan in the morning and Mahavira in the afternoon. There is a difference of opinion in the Digambar texts about when each Tirthankara attained Kevalgyan. According to the Aavashyak Niyukti, Bhagwan Rishabhdev's Jiva knew the twelve Angas, 184 which is a clear indication. The Digambar tradition believes that Rishabh's Jiva knew the eleven Angas and the fourteen previous births. Thus, the material has been selected in the twenty-third Samavay.

The twenty-fourth Samavay describes twenty-four Tirthankaras, the Jivas of the small Himalayas and the Shikhari mountain, twenty-four Ahmindras, the twenty-four-fingered masculine shadow of the sun in the Uttarayana, the twenty-four-kos extent of the source of the Ganga and Sindhu rivers, and the twenty-four Palyopam and Sagropam states of the Narakas and Devas. 179.

## The Twenty-Fifth Samavaya: An Analysis

The Twenty-Fifth Samavaya mentions twenty-five reflections on the five great vows (Panchayama) of the first and last Tirthankaras. Malli Bhagwati was twenty-five Dhanush high. The Vaitalya mountain is twenty-five Yojan high and twenty-five Kos deep in the earth. There are twenty-five lakh Naraka-avas in the second Naraka. There are twenty-five studies of the Acharanga Sutra. Twenty-five Uttar-Prakritis of the Aparyapta Mithyadrishti Vikalendriya Karma bind. There are twenty-five Arthaadhikars of the Lokabindu Saar. There are twenty-five Palyopama and Sagaropama states of Narakas and Devas. Here, first of all, twenty-five reflections on the five great vows are mentioned.

Reflection is essential for Sadhana. It has immense power and unlimited strength. By the power of reflection, even the impossible becomes possible. Reflection is the mental state that is affected or influenced by efforts and resolutions. Acharya Patanjali considered reflection and chanting to be inseparable. Bhagwan Mahavira clearly stated that one whose reflection is pure is like a boat in water. He reaches the shore and is freed from all sorrows. There can be many types of reflection - knowledge, perception, and character, devotion, etc.! All the best efforts that affect the soul are reflections. However, there are many classifications of reflection. There are twenty-five reflections on the five great vows, which are for the stability of the great vows. Each great vow has five reflections. The names of the reflections mentioned in the Agam literature, Acharanga and Prashnavyakaran, are slightly different in the Samavayanga. In Acharanga, the five reflections of the Ahimsa Mahavrat are: (1) I-Samiti (2) Manparijna (3) Vachanparijna (4) Adananiksepan Samiti (5) Alokita Panabhojan. In Prashnavyakaran, the five reflections of the Ahimsa Mahavrat are: (1) Iryasamiti (2) Apapaman (3) Apapavchan (4) Eshanasamiti (5) Adan Niksepan Samiti. While in the present Samavaya, the five reflections of the Ahimsa Mahavrat are: (1) Iryasamiti (2) Manogupti (3) Vachan gupti (4) Alok Bhajan Bhojan (5) Adan-Bhandamaatra-Niksepan Samiti. Acharya Kundakunda has also mentioned the reflections of the Ahimsa Mahavrat in the same way. In the Tattvarthaadhigama Bhashya, the five reflections are: (1) Iryasamiti (2) Manogupti (3) Eshanasamiti (4) Adananiksepan Samiti (5) Alokita Panabhojan Samiti. In the Tattvartha Rajavartika and Sarvarthasiddhi, Vakgupti is mentioned in place of Eshanasamiti. Similarly, the five reflections of the Satya Mahavrat in Acharanga are: (1) Anuvechibhashan (2) Krodhpratyakhyan (3) Lobhpratyakhyan (4) Bhaypratyakhyan (5) Hasya pratyakhyan. The same names are found in Prashnavyakaran. In Samavayanga, the five reflections are: (1) Anuvechibhashan (2) Krodhvivek (3) Lobhvivek (4) Bhayvivek and (5) Hasya vivek. In Acharanga and Prashnavyakaran, the rejection of anger, etc., is mentioned. While in Samavayanga, the word Vivek is mentioned. Vivek means the avoidance of anger, etc. Acharya Kundakunda has mentioned the five reflections of the Satya Mahavrat as follows: (1) Akrodh (2) Abhay (3) Ahaasya (4) Alobh (5) Amoh. He has mentioned the rejection of anger, etc., in the Shwetamber.

Instead of mentioning *anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) in the tradition, *amoh* (amoh) feeling has been mentioned. In the commentary of Charitrapraabhrut 99, the meaning of *amoh* (amoh) has been given as *anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) skill. *Anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) means that the language is *anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) according to the *Vichin* (Vichin) *Vaglehari* (Vaglehari) *Tamnukruty* (Tamnukruty) or language, according to the *Sanuveechibhasajinsutra* (Sanuveechibhasajinsutra). The meaning is that the language is *anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) according to the *Purvaacharya* (Purvaacharya) sutra tradition, violating the *Purvaacharya* (Purvaacharya) sutra tradition. In the Shwetambar tradition, the meaning of *anuveechibhasan* (anuveechibhasan) is "speaking after thinking, i.e., speaking after thinking". Both meanings have been accepted in *Tattvarthrajwartik* (Tattvarthrajwartik) 200. The five feelings of the *Achaury* (Achaury) great vow are as follows: (1) *Anuveechimitaavgrah* (Anuveechimitaavgrah) *yaachan* (yaachan) (2) *Anugyaapit* (Anugyaapit) *paan-bhojan* (paan-bhojan) (3) *Avgrah* (Avgrah) *ka* (ka) *avdharan* (avdharan) (4) *Abhikshanavgrahyaachan* (Abhikshanavgrahyaachan) (5) *Sadharmic* (Sadharmic) *se* (se) *avgrah* (avgrah) *yaachan* (yaachan). In *Prashnavyakaran* (Prashnavyakaran), (1) *Vivikt* (Vivikt) *vasavasati* (vasavasati) (2) *Abhikshan* (Abhikshan) *avgrah* (avgrah) *yaachan* (yaachan) (3) *Shayya* (Shayya) *samiti* (samiti) (4) *Sadharan* (Sadharan) *pindmaatra* (pindmaatra) *laabh* (laabh) (5) *Vinay* (Vinay) *prayog* (prayog). In *Samavaayang* (Samavaayang) sutra, these names are: (1) *Avgrahanugyaapana* (Avgrahanugyaapana) (2) *Avgrah* (Avgrah) *seemaparijnaan* (seemaparijnaan) (3) *Swayam* (Swayam) *hee* (hee) *avgrah* (avgrah) *anugrahantata* (anugrahantata) (4) *Sadharmic* (Sadharmic) *avgrah* (avgrah) *anugyaapanata* (anugyaapanata) (5) *Sadharan* (Sadharan) *bhaktpaan* (bhaktpaan) *anugyaapy* (anugyaapy) *paribhunjanata* (paribhunjanata). Acharya Kundkund has given the five feelings of the *Archaary* (Archaary) great vow as follows: (1) *Shunyaagaarnivas* (Shunyaagaarnivas) (2) *Vimochitaavas* (Vimochitaavas) (3) *Paruprodh* (Paruprodh) *na* (na) *karna* (karna) (4) *Eshanashuddhi* (Eshanashuddhi) (5) *Sadharmic* (Sadharmic) *avisanvaad* (avisanvaad). The five feelings of the *Achaury* (Achaury) great vow are different in the Digambar tradition's texts from the Shwetambar Agam texts. Just as Acharya Kundkund has described the feelings, they have also been described in *Sarvarth Siddhi* (Sarvarth Siddhi).
In *Achaarang* (Achaarang), the five feelings of the *Brahmacharya* (Brahmacharya) great vow are as follows: (1) *Streekathavarjan* (Streekathavarjan) (2) *Stree* (Stree) *ke* (ke) *ang* (ang) *pratyang* (pratyang) *avlokan* (avlokan) *ka* (ka) *varjan* (varjan) (3) *Purvabhuukt* (Purvabhuukt) *bhog* (bhog) *smriti* (smriti) *ka* (ka) *varjan* (varjan) (4) *Atimaatra* (Atimaatra) *aur* (aur) *pranit* (pranit) *paan* (paan) *bhojan* (bhojan) *ka* (ka) *parivarjan* (parivarjan) (5) *Stree* (Stree) *aady* (aady) *se* (se) *sansakt* (sansakt) *shayanasan* (shayanasan) *ka* (ka) *vajan* (vajan). In *Prashnavyakaran* (Prashnavyakaran), (1) *Asansakt* (Asansakt) *vaas* (vaas) *vasati* (vasati), (2) *Streejan* (Streejan) *katha* (katha) *varjan* (varjan) (3) *Stree* (Stree) *ke* (ke) *ang* (ang) *pratyangon* (pratyangon) *aur* (aur) *cheshtaon* (cheshtaon) *ke* (ke) *avlokan* (avlokan) *ka* (ka) *varjan* (varjan) (4) *Purv* (Purv) *bhuukt* (bhuukt) *aur* (aur) *purv* (purv) *kridit* (kridit) *ka* (ka) *asmaran* (as

There were four yamas during the reign of Tak. Uttaraadhyayanasutra 203, Bhagavati 204, etc. are evidence of this. In the present Samavay, the Vaithadya mountain is said to be twenty-five yojanas high, but due to carelessness, twenty-five dhanushas have been printed, which is not correct. Thus, the twenty-fifth Samavay contains a collection of material. The twenty-sixth to twenty-ninth Samavayas: An Analysis

The twenty-sixth Samavay mentions twenty-six Uddeshan Kalas of the Dasashrutaskandha, Kalpasutra and Vyavaharsutra. It describes the twenty-six natures of the mohaniya karma of the abhavya jivas, the twenty-six palyopama and sagaropama states of the narakas and devas.

The twenty-seventh Samavay describes the twenty-seven qualities of a Shraman, the twenty-seven days of the nakshatra masa, the twenty-seven natures of the mohaniya karma of a bandha-free jiva with vedak samyaktva, the twenty-seven angula paurushi shadow on the seventh day of Shravan Sudi, and the twenty-seven palyopama and sagaropama states of the narakas and devas.

The twenty-eighth Samavay describes the twenty-eight types of Acharaprakalpa. It mentions the twenty-eight natures of the mohaniya karma in the bhavasiddhika jivas. There are twenty-eight types of Abhinibodhik knowledge. There are twenty-eight lakh vimanas in the Ishana Kalpa. The name karma that binds the deva gati binds twenty-eight natures, and the naraki jiva also binds twenty-eight natures. The difference is between auspicious and inauspicious. It describes the twenty-eight palyopama and sagaropama states of the narakas and devas.

Here, first of all, the twenty-eight types of Acharaprakalpa are described. Acharya Sanghadas Ganii 205 considered the following as synonyms for Nishita's Achar, Agra, Prakalpa, Chulika: Achar, Agra, Prakalpa, Chulika. The said scripture is related to Charan Karananuyoga. Therefore, its name is "Achar". There are five Agras in Acharangasutra - four Achar Chulas and Nishita. Therefore, Nishita is called Agra. 206 Nishita is created from the ninth Purva Achar Prabhut, therefore its name is Prakalpa. The second meaning of Prakalpa is also "to pierce". 207 In Agam literature, Nishita is called "Ayara Kalpa". Agra and Chula are both words with the same meaning. Twenty-eight types of Abhinibodhik knowledge have been described. In Nandi Sutra 208, and also in Tattvarth Sutra 206, Tattvarth Bhashya 210, Tattvarth Rajavartika 211, Visheshavashak Bhashya 212, etc., knowledge has been discussed in detail. 213 Here, only a hint has been given. In this way, the twenty-eighth Samavay contains a collection of material.

The twenty-ninth Samvaya discusses the concept of Papashruta (sinful scriptures) and its connection to the twenty-nine nights and days of the Aashaadh month. It also mentions the twenty-nine types of Namekarma (karmic actions) that bind a Samyagdristi (rightly-seeing) Tirthankara (liberated soul) and their names. The text further describes the twenty-nine Palyopam (comparisons to a hair) and Sagaropama (comparisons to an ocean) states of Narakas (hells) and Devas (gods).

This Samvaya primarily focuses on the concept of Papashruta. While the Stananga Sutra (214) mentions nine types of Papashruta, the Samvayanga Sutra expands this to twenty-nine. The text emphasizes that even the worship of false scriptures can lead to sin, hence the importance of understanding Papashruta. However, for a Samyagdristi, even Papashruta can become Samyakshruta (rightly-seen scriptures). Acharya Devavachka states, "Samm-ditthas samm-suyam, miccha-ditthis miccha-suyam" (For the rightly-seeing, it is rightly-seen, for the wrongly-seeing, it is wrongly-seen). A Samyagdristi analyzes these scriptures with discernment, considering the context and purpose, thus negating their potential for sin. Throughout Jain history, many influential Acharyas have used these scriptures to spread the Dharma. Therefore, the twenty-ninth Samvaya serves as a compilation of important knowledge.

**From the Thirtieth to the Thirty-fourth Samvaya: An Analysis**

The thirtieth Samvaya discusses the thirty places where Mohaniya Karma (karma that binds delusion) is generated. It also mentions the thirty years of Shraman Paryaya (period of asceticism) of Manditputra Sthavir, the thirty Muhurta (auspicious moments) in a day and night, the thirty Dhanush (bows) height of the eighteenth Tirthankara named Ar, the thirty thousand Samanik Devas (minor gods) of Sahasrar Devendra, the thirty years of Lord Parshva and Lord Mahavira's stay in their respective households, the thirty lakh Narakavas (hellish states) of Ratnapraba Earth, and the thirty Palyopam and Sagaropama states of Narakas and Devas.

The thirty causes of Mohaniya Karma, mentioned in the Samvayanga Sutra, are elaborated upon in the Dasha Shruta Skandha (215) and briefly mentioned in the Aavashyak Sutra (216). Commentators explain that the term "Mohaniya" generally refers to all eight types of karma, but specifically refers to Mohaniya Karma. This Samvaya also contains valuable historical information about Ar, Parshva, and Mahavira.

The thirty-first Samvaya discusses the thirty qualities that manifest during the initial attainment of Siddhatva Paryaya (liberation), the Mandar mountain, the Abhivaddhit Maas (month with an extra day), the Suryamas (solar month), the calculation of night and day, and the thirty Palyopam and Sagaropama states of Narakas and Devas.

The thirty-second Samvaya discusses the thirty Yogasangraha (collections of yoga), the thirty Devendras (chief gods), the thirty-two hundred Kevalis (omniscient beings) of Kunthu Arhat, the thirty lakh Vimanas (flying vehicles) in the Saudharma Kalpa (heavenly realm), the thirty-two stars of the Revati Nakshatra (constellation), the thirty-two types of Natya-vidhi (dramatic techniques), and the thirty-two Sagaropama and Palyopam states of Narakas and Devas.

The term "Yoga" refers to the actions of mind, speech, and body. The thirty-two Yogasangraha here focus on the virtuous actions of mind, speech, and body. The Brihadvritti (extensive commentary) on the Aavashyak Sutra elaborates on this topic.

The thirty-third Samvaya discusses the thirty Ashatanas (desires), the thirty-storeyed palace in the Asura Indra's capital, and the thirty Sagaropama and Palyopam states of Narakas and Devas.

It is important to remember that the number of Sagaropama states mentioned for each Deva corresponds to their specific level of spiritual development.

They breathe in and out on the same sides. And after a thousand years, they desire to eat. In the present Samavaya, how should the behavior of the Laghu Shramanas towards the Jyeshta Shramanas be respectful, and how should they constantly avoid Ashatana, etc.? The action that causes a decline in knowledge, vision, and character is Ashatana-Avagya. The thirty-three Ashatanas are described in detail in Dasha Shruta Skandha 218.

In the thirty-fourth Samavaya, the thirty-four Atishayas of the Tirthankaras, the thirty-four Vijayakshetras of the Chakravarti, the thirty-four long Vaitaldhyas in Jambudvipa, the thirty-four excellent Tirthankaras who can be born in Jambudvipa, and the thirty-four lakhs of Asuraindras and the thirty-four lakhs of Narakavasa in the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh Narakas are mentioned. The present Samavaya mentions the Atishayas. Regarding the Atishayas, Acharya Hemchandra has pondered in the Yogashastra 219 and Abhidhan Chintamani 220, etc. That contemplation is based on the Brihad Vachana. Here, from the second Atishaya to the fifth Atishaya in the thirty-four Atishayas are Janmapratyayik. From the twenty-first to the thirty-fourth Atishaya and the twelfth Atishaya are due to the destruction of karma. The remaining Atishayas are Devakrit.

The Digambar tradition also believes in thirty-four Atishayas. But there is some difference in those Atishayas. They believe in ten Janmapratyay, fourteen Devakrit, and ten Kevalgyan Krit.

Here, it should be remembered that according to the commentator of Samavayanga, Acharya Abhaydev, Ahar Nihar are invisible to the eye. These are Janmakrit Atishayas. While according to the Digambar view, the absence of food is considered an Atishaya, and it is not Janmakrit but Kevalgyan Krit. From the Shwetamber perspective, the Bhagwan gives sermons in Ardhamagadhi, and that sermon is transformed into the language of all beings. These two Atishayas are considered Karmakshayakrit.

There is some difference in the division method in the Atishaya descriptions of Acharya Abhaydev and Acharya Hemchandra. But both Abhaydev and Hemchandra have the same opinion regarding language. According to Acharya Hemchandra, nineteen Atishayas are Devakrit, while according to Abhaydev, fifteen Atishayas are Devakrit. Acharya Hemchandra has written that the Bhagwan's face is visible all around. That is a Devakrit Atishaya, while according to the Digambar view, it is Kevalgyan Krit. The creation of the three Kotas is also considered a Devakrit Atishaya. But it is not mentioned in the thirty-four Atishayas in Samavayanga. There is a lack of strong arguments regarding the division of the thirty-four Atishayas that the Acharyas have done, as to why a particular Atishaya is given in a particular division? It should also be remembered that there is no division of any kind in the original Samavayangasutra. Like Samavayanga, the Anguttaranikaya (5.121) mentions five Atishayas of the Tathagata Buddha - they are knowledgeable about meaning, knowledgeable about Dharma, knowledgeable about limits, knowledgeable about time, and knowledgeable about the assembly.

From the thirty-fifth Samavaya to the hundredth Samavaya: An Analysis

The thirty-fifth Samavaya mentions the thirty-five Atishayas of true words, Kunthu, Arhat, Datta Vasudev, Nandan Baldev, these thirty-five bows.

In the 99th Samavay, Mount Meru is 99,000 yojan high from the earth. In the 100th Samavay, the age of Bhagwan Parsva and Ganadhar Sudharma was one hundred years, this is the description.
The above collection of vast material from the 35th Samavay to the 100th Samavay. Much of it is related to mythological subjects. There has been consideration from many perspectives on subjects like geography and astronomy, heaven and hell, etc. Modern science has not yet reached the vast geographical areas of Jainism. The unknown is more than the known. Upon investigation, knowledge of many unknown serious mysteries can be obtained. Many mysteries have been revealed in these Samavays for modern investigators. It is the work of investigators to find those mysteries in a modern perspective.
Historically, it also contains vast material about the twenty-four Tirthankars, Chakravarti, Vasudev, Baldev, Ganadhar, Shraman, Shramani, Shravak, Shravika, etc. of the Tirthankars. Tirthankars are the creators of Jain rule. They are the promoters of the code of conduct of the spiritual world. Their life has been a constant guide for seekers. The original seed of the vast life stories of the Tirthankars is in the presented Samavayang. These seeds have been able to take a vast form in other Charit Granths. There is vast material on the pre-historical and historical subjects of the Tirthankars and it can also be contemplated in the light of the opinions of other scholars. However, keeping in mind the limitations of the preface, I will definitely inform the curious readers that they should read my book, "Bhagwan Rishabhdev: A Scrutiny", "Bhagwan Parsva: A Critical Review".

Please review the texts "Adhyayan", "Bhagwan Aristanemi", "Karm yogi Shri Krishna: Ek Anushilan", and "Bhagwan Mahavir: Ek Anushilan". I have provided many facts about the Tirthankaras in these texts. Similarly, I have discussed the Ganadharas of Bhagwan Maha in the "Mahavir Anushilan" text.

**Script-Thoughts**

The 46th Samavay states that the number of letters used in the Brahmi script is 46. Acharya Abhaydev has clarified in the commentary of the present Agam that the 46 letters should be from "Akar" to "Hakar" including "Ksha". He has not counted "Rri Rri L L". The remaining letters have been taken. The 18th Samavay mentions the names of the Brahmi script in relation to scripts. Acharya Abhaydev has clearly written about these scripts that he has not received any information about them, so he could not give a description of it. After modern research, it can be said in this regard that the script used in Ashoka's inscriptions is Brahmi script. The script of the Greeks is Yavani script, which is now known as Arabic and Persian etc. The Kharoshti script was prevalent in Gandhar country. This script was written from right to left. The two inscriptions of Ashoka that have been found in the North-West Frontier Province have used the present script. Kharoshti is made from the two words "Khar" and "Oshta". Khar means donkey. It is possible that the turn of the present script is like the lips of a donkey. Therefore, its name may have been Kharoshti, Kharoshtika or Kharoshtrka. The name of the fifth script is "Kharshraavita". The script whose pronunciation is ear-piercing like the sound of a donkey, due to which its name may have been "Kharshraavita". The name of the sixth script is "Pakaradhika". Its Prakrit form may be "Pahraiya". It is possible that its name may have been "Pakaradhika" because of the abundance of Pakar or because it starts with Pakar. The name of the eleventh script is "Nihnvika". The word Nihnva has been very widely used in Jain tradition in the sense of "hiding". The script that is secret or symbolic can be Nihnvika. Currently, the use of sign language is as a very fast script. In ancient times, there would have been a similar symbolic script, which would have been known as Nihnvika. The name of the twelfth script is Ankalipi. The script made from numbers should be Ankalipi. Acharya Kumudeendu has done the Utakana of the "Bhu-Valaya" text in this script. This text was with Yallapa Shastri, who was a resident of Visveswaram. I saw it in Delhi in 1954. It has a collection and assessment of various subjects, and there was the use of many languages! According to Yallapa Shastri, it has one crore shlokas and it has been called "the greatest wonder of the world" by the President of India, Rajendra Babu. The thirteenth script is "Ganitlip". Due to being modern based on the symbols related to mathematics, the script may have been known as "Ganitlip". The name of the fourteenth script is "Gandharva" script. This script was a special script of the Gandharva caste. The name of the fifteenth script is "Bhutlip". It is called Bhutlip because it was prevalent in Bhutan. Bhutan is currently called Bhutan. Or it may have been the script prevalent in the Bhot or Bhotia, and the Bhut caste. It is possible that the script of the Paishachi language is called Bhutlip. Bhut and Pishach, both these words have been synonymous. Therefore, the Paishachi script may have been called Bhutlip. The sixteenth script, which would have been very beautiful and attractive, would have been famous at that time as "Adarsh Lipi". Where this script was prevalent, script experts have not been able to decide yet. The name of the seventeenth script is "Maheshwari" script. Maheshwari is a caste in the Vaishya Varna. It is possible that the special script of this caste was prevalent in ancient times. 221. Author-Shri Devendramuni Shastri, Shri Tarakguru Jain Granthalaya, Shastri Circle, Udaipur (Rajasthan)

And it is called Maheswari script. The eighteenth script is Brahmi script. This script would have been of the Dravidians. It is clear from the name that the Pulinda script would have been related to the tribals. But all this is still just speculation. More exploration is needed to determine their true nature. The Buddhist text "Lalitavistara" mentions the names of sixty-four scripts. The descriptions of the scripts that have come in Samvayanga can be compared with those names.
After the hundredth Samvaya, various topics with numbers ranging from 150-200-250-300-350-400-450-500 to 1000 to 2000 to 10000 to one lakh, from that 8 lakhs and crores have been compiled in these Samvayas.
Here we are presenting thoughts only in relation to some major topics. There is a description of the sixth Pottil's bhav before the Tirthankara bhav of Bhagwan Mahavira. In the necessary appointment 222, there is a detailed description of the twenty-seven bhavs of Lord Mahavira. There, the Jiva of Nandan took initiation from Pottil and there is no mention of Pottil in the previous bhavs of Nandan, nor is this mention found anywhere in Aavashyakachurni, Aavashyak Haribhadriya Vritti, Aavashyak Malayagiri Vritti and Mahavirachariyam etc. Acharya Abhaydev has clarified in the Vritti of the presented Agam that there was one bhav of a prince named Pottil, from there he became a Dev, the second bhav. From there, he was expelled and became a prince named Nandan in Kshatranagari, this is the third bhav. From there he went to Devalok, this is the fourth bhav. From there he came to the womb of Devananda, this is the fifth bhav and from there he was brought to the womb of Trishala Kshatriyani, this is the sixth bhav! By calculating in this way, the sixth bhav of Pottil can happen.
The names of the mothers of the Tirthankaras that have come in Samvayangasutra are written differently in the Digambar tradition, they are as follows - Marudevi, Vijayaseena, Susena, Siddhartha, Mangala, Sushima, Prithvi Sena, Lakshmana, Jayarama, (Rama) Sunanda, Nanda (Vishnu Shri) Jayavati (Patla) Jayshyama (Sharma) Sharma (Revati) Suprabha (Suvrata) Aira, Shrikant (Shrimati) Mitra Sena, Prajavati (Rakshita) Soma (Padmavati) Vapilla (Vapra) Shivadevi, Vamadevi, Priyakarini Trishala223. Their names are also found in the necessary appointment 224.
The names of the Tirthankaras of the upcoming Utsarpini that have come in Samvayanga are the same as those found in Pravachansar. But the names that have come in Lokaprakash225 are different in terms of order. There is a difference in the names mentioned in Jinaprabhasuri's 'Prakrit Diwali Kalp' and their order. The names of the upcoming twenty-four in the Digambar tradition are obtained as follows -
(1) Shri Mahapadma (2) Suredev (3) Suparshva (4) Swayamprabhu (5) Sarvatmabhu (6) Shridev (7) Kulputradev (8) Udankdev (9) Prosthildeva, (10) Jayakirti (11) Munisuvrat (12) Araha (13) Nishapap (14) Nishkashya (15) Vipul (16) Nirmal (17) Chitragupta (18) Samadhiyukt (19) Swayambhu (20) Anivritt (21) Jayanath (22) Shrivimala (23) Devpal (24) Anantvirya
The names of the past twenty-four are also found in Digambar texts.226 222. Necessary appointment-Gatha 448 223. See Uttarapurana and Harivansh Purana _ Necessary appointment-Gatha 358, 386

This Samvayanga mentions the Kulkaras. While the Stanangasutra mentions the names of ten Kulkaras of the past Utsarpini, the Samvayanga mentions seven names, and there are differences in the names. Kulkaras were the administrators of an era when humans were completely free from family, social, political, and economic bonds. They had no worries about food or clothing. They obtained their desired objects from trees. They lived independent lives. They were extremely low in kshaya (passions) by nature. In that era, there were elephants, horses, cows, bulls, and animals in the forests, but they did not use those animals. Economically, there was neither a श्रेष्ठी (superior) nor an अनुचर (follower). There was no fear of diseases like today. They remained free from desires throughout their lives. In the twilight of their lives, they became husband and wife, merging as brother and sister, and gave birth to a child as a couple of one man and one woman. They nurtured them for 49 days and then died. Their death also occurred without pain, just with a yawn and a sneeze. This was the life of the Yauglik period. By the end of the third Ara, the Yauglik-Maryadas (rules) gradually began to be destroyed in the third division. Cravings increased, and the power of the Kalpa trees began to decline. At that time, some special individuals were born who managed the system. They were called Kulkaras. The first Kulkaras appeared when 1/8th of the third Ara remained. There have been differences of opinion in various texts regarding the number of Kulkaras. The 227th and final Kulkar was "Rishabh", the son of Nabhi, who was also the first Tirthankara. His son was Bharat Chakravarti. Tirthankara Rishabh established the Dharmachakra, while Bharat Chakravarti established the Rajya-chakra. In the fourth Ara, twenty-three Tirthankaras, eleven Chakravartis, nine Baldevs, nine Vasudevas, and Prativa-sudevas, etc., were born.

Thus, we see that the Samvayanga is a collection of many important facts for inquisitive seekers and researchers. It is extremely important from the perspective of Vस्तु-विज्ञान (science of objects), Jain principles, and Jain history. It contains over a hundred topics. Modern thinkers argue that the Samvayanga was composed after Lord Mahavira attained liberation, based on the 92-year lifespan of Ganadhar Gautam and the 100-year lifespan of Ganadhar Sudharma mentioned in the Samvayanga. In response to their argument, we would humbly request that the ages of the Ganadharas, etc., were compiled by Devarddigni Kshamashraman. I have also discussed this issue in detail in the introduction to the Stananga. It is a complete historical truth that this Agam is Ganadhar-created.

This Agam is primarily in prose, but there are also verses in between, related to names and other details. It is also important from the perspective of commentary. There is use of figures of speech in some places. There is also mention of Lord Parshva and his fourteen predecessors, Avadhijnani, and special knowledgeable monks, supported by numbers, which is important from a historical perspective.

Comparative Study

The Samvayanga Sutra contains a greater collection of various topics than other Agams. The Bhagavati Sutra is rich in content and also vast in size. The Samvayanga Sutra is very small in size. Just as Vishnu Muni measured the vast universe with three steps, so is the situation of the Samvayanga. If we compare the topics found in the Samvayanga Sutra with other Agam literature, it will be easily known that the Vyavahar Sutra rightly states that the knower of Stananga and Samvayanga is the Acharya and 
227. Jambudvipaprajnapti, in the second Vakshaskara, mentions fifteen Kulkaras, while the Digambar text "Siddhant-Sangrah" mentions fourteen Kulkaras. [54]

The Upadhyaya can hold such a glorious position because the *Sthananga* and *Samavayanga* contain concise discussions of all the topics that are essential for the Acharya and Upadhyaya positions. In short, it can be said that the vast ocean of *Jinavani* has been filled into a pitcher called *Samavayanga*. This is why its clear echo is heard in other *Agam* literature. Therefore, we are comparing the topics of *Samavayanga* in the light of other *Agams* very briefly here.

1. **Samavayanga and Acharanga**

*Acharanga* is of paramount importance for those who are curious about *Jinavani*. It is the first *Anga* - from the point of view of composition and also from the point of view of establishment. *Acharanga* is amazing from the point of view of style of composition, style of language and subject matter. It is important from both the point of view of *Achar* and *Darshan*. We are briefly comparing *Samavayanga* with *Acharanga*.

The third sutra of the first *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - 'Ege Dande', this is also mentioned in *Acharanga* 229. The second sutra of the fifth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is 'Panch Mahvvyaya Pannatta...' then this is also explained in *Acharanga* 230.

- The third sutra of the fifth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - 'Panch Kamguna Pannatta...' then this is also explained in *Acharanga* 231.

The sixth sutra of the fifth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - 'Panch Nijarana Pannatta...' then this description is also found in *Acharanga* 222.

The second sutra of the sixth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is 'Chh Jiwanikaya Pannatta...' then this is also explained in *Acharanga* 233.

The third sutra of the seventh *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - 'Samane Bhagavan Mahavir Sattarayaniyo Uddham Ucchatenam Hottha...' then this same description of Mahavira's *Avagahana* is also found in *Acharanga* 234.

The third sutra of the ninth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - 'Nav Bhamcheara Pannatta...' then the description of *Brahmacharya* is also found in *Acharanga* 235.

The first sutra of the twenty-fifth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* is - "Purim- Pacchimgaganam Titthagaranam Panch-Jamass Panavinsam Bhavanao Pannattao........" then the mention of twenty-five *Bhavana* of five *Mahavrat* is also found in *Acharanga* 236.

In the thirtieth *Samavay* of *Samavayanga* it is said "Samane Bhagavan Mahavir Tisan Vasai Aagaravasamjje Vasitta Agarao Apgaariyam Pavvaie.." then this same description of Bhagavan Mahavira's initiation is also found in *Acharanga* 237.

The first sutra of the eleventh Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Munisuvvayass naṁ arahao paṇṇāsaṁ ajjiyā sāhassiyo hotthā...................."  This is also mentioned in Acharanga 238, describing the Aryikas of Munisuvrata.
The second sutra of the twenty-second Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Samaṇe bhagavaṁ Mahāvīre bāsīe rāidīehiṁ vīikkantēhiṁ gabbhāo gabbhaṁ sāhariē239... .........."  This is also mentioned in Acharanga 240, describing the change of womb of Bhagavan Mahavira.
The first sutra of the twenty-ninth Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Bāṇauī padimao paṇṇattāo..  This is also mentioned in Acharanga 241, describing the twenty-ninth images.
The similarities between the topics of Samavayanga and Acharanga are mentioned here.
Samavayanga and Sutra-kritanga
Sutra-kritanga is the second Anga. While Acharanga mainly focuses on conduct, Sutra-kritanga focuses on philosophy. It provides a clear glimpse into the philosophies of the Mahavira era. Like Acharanga, it is unique in its language, style, and expression. Here is a brief comparison of Sutra-kritanga with Samavayanga.
The ninth sutra of the first Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege dhamme"  This is also mentioned in Sutra-kritanga 242.
The tenth sutra of the first Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege adhamme"  This is also mentioned in Sutra-kritanga 243.
The eleventh sutra of the first Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege puṇṇe"  This is also mentioned in Sutra-kritanga 244, describing punya.
The twelfth sutra of the first Samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege pāve"  This is also mentioned in Sutra-kritanga 245, describing papa.

In this way, there are many similarities between Samavayanga and Sutra-Kritanga.
Both the Agamas,  Sthananga and Samavayanga, are constructed in the same style. Therefore, there is a lot of similarity in the subject matter of both. The comparison of these two has already been done in the introduction of Sthananga Sutra, therefore, we are not repeating it here. The inquisitive person should look at that introduction.
Samavayanga and Bhagavati
There is also similarity in the subject matter at many places in both these Agamas, Samavayanga and Bhagavati. Therefore, here we are giving a comparative study of the topics of Samavayanga with Bhagavati.
The first sutra of the first samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege Aaya", and the same concept of Atma being one in terms of Chaitanya Guna is also described in Bhagavati 255.
The second sutra of the first samavaya of Samavayanga is "Ege Anaaya", and the same concept of Anatma being one in terms of the perspective of the sutra is also described in Bhagavati 256.

Samavayanga and Prajnaapana
Prajnaapana is the fourth Upanga. The meaning of Prajnaapana is - the scripture that describes the Jiva and Ajiva. Acharya Malayagiri considers Prajnaapana to be an Upanga of the Samavaya. When the relationship between Prajnaapana and Samavayanga was established is a subject of research. Shramaacharya himself indicates that Prajnaapana is taken from the Drishtivad. But today, Drishtivad is unavailable. Therefore, it cannot be said clearly how much material has been taken from it. Drishtivad mainly describes the Drishti or Darshan. Samavayanga also mainly describes the Jiva, Ajiva, and other elements. So, Prajnaapana also has the same description. Therefore, there is no obstacle in considering Prajnaapana as an Upanga of the Samavayanga. Therefore, the topics found in the Samavayanga can be easily compared with Prajnaapana.
The fifth sutra of the first Samavaya is - 'Ega kiriya' and the description of Kriya is also found in Prajnaapana 524. The twentieth sutra of the first Samavaya - 'Appitthane nare......' and the dimension-vishkambh of the Apratishthan Naraka is also described in Prajnaapana 125.
The twenty-second sutra of the first Samavaya - 'Savvatthaside Mahavimaane......' and the dimension-vishkambh of the Sarvarthaside Vimana is described as one hundred thousand yojanas in Prajnaapana 126.
The twenty-sixth sutra of the first Samavaya - 'Imise nam rayanppahae nam.....' and the situation of some Narakas of Ratnaprabha is described as one Palyopama in Prajnaapana 127.
The description from the twenty-seventh to the fortieth sutra of the first Samavaya is found in the same way in the fourth pada of Prajnaapana 28.

Thus, there is a similarity of subject matter in many places in the Samvayanga and Jambudvipaprajnapti. Due to the fear of expansion, we have left out the comparison of some sutras here.

Samvayanga and Suryaprajnapti

Suryaprajnapti is the sixth Upanga. Dr. Winternitz considered Suryaprajnapti to be a scientific text. Dr. Schubring, in his speech at the University of Hamburg in Germany, said that "the logical and consistent principles presented by Jain thinkers are invaluable and important even from the perspective of modern scientists. Along with refined cosmographical ideas, there is a high standard of astronomy and mathematics. Suryaprajnapti deeply discusses mathematics and astronomy, therefore, without studying Suryaprajnapti, the history of Indian astronomy cannot be understood correctly."

Page #101:
---------------------------
Here, we will briefly compare the topics discussed in the Samavayanga with the Surya Prajnapti.

The first Samavaya of the Samavayanga describes the Ardra, Chitra, and Swati constellations in the 23rd, 24th, and 25th sutras, respectively. This description is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 692.

The second Samavaya, from the fourth to the seventh Samavaya, describes the stars of Purva Phalguni, Uttara Phalguni, Purva Bhadrapada, and Uttara Bhadrapada. This is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 693.

The third Samavaya, from the sixth to the twelfth sutra, describes the constellations Mrigashira, Pushya, Jyeshta, Abhijit, Shravana, Ashwini, Bharani, etc. This description is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 694.

The fourth Samavaya, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth sutras, describes the four stars of the Anuradha, Purva Ashadha, and Uttara Ashadha constellations. The description of these stars is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 695.

The fifth Samavaya, from the ninth to the thirteenth sutras, describes the five stars of the Rohini, Punarvasu, Hasta, Visakha, and Dhanishta constellations. This description is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 696.

The sixth Samavaya, in the seventh and eighth sutras, mentions the six stars of the Krittika and Ashlesha constellations. This is also mentioned in the Surya Prajnapti 697.

The seventh Samavaya, from the seventh to the eleventh sutras, describes the stars and their gates of the Magha, Krittika, Anuradha, and Dhanishta constellations. This is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 698.

The ninth sutra of the eighth Samavaya states "Atthanakkhatta Chandem..." and the Surya Prajnapti 699 also describes the eight constellations of Krittika, Rohini, Punarvasu, Magha, Chitra, Visakha, Anuradha, and Jyeshta that form the Pramard Yoga with the Moon.

The fifth, sixth, and seventh sutras of the ninth Samavaya describe the Abhijit constellation's conjunction with the Moon and state that the Ratnaprabha is a star nine hundred yojanas above the Earth. This description is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 700. The only difference between the Samavayanga and the Surya Prajnapti is that the Samavayanga states the conjunction time of Abhijit with the Moon as 9 muhurtas, while the Surya Prajnapti 701 states it as 12 muhurtas.

The second, third, and fifth sutras of the eleventh Samavaya describe the beginning of the Jyotish chakra and mention the eleven stars of the Mula constellation. This description is also found in the Surya Prajnapti 702.

**Samavayanga and Uttaradhyayana**

Uttaradhyayana holds the first place among the original Sutras. It is extremely important from the perspective of Agam sentiment, language, and style. It contains a beautiful analysis of Dharma, Darshan, Adhyatma, Yoga, etc. Here, we will briefly compare the topics discussed in the Samavayanga with those discussed in the Uttaradhyayana, which will naturally reveal the importance of the Samavayanga.

The 3rd Sutra of the 2nd Samavaya mentions two types of bondage: Raga and Dvesha. Uttaradhyayana 723 also describes them.

The ideas that are revealed from the fourteenth to the nineteenth sutras of the fifth Samavaya are also to be seen in the Anuyogadvara.
From the tenth to the fifteenth sutras of the sixth Samavaya, and from the twelfth to the twentieth sutras of the seventh Samavaya, from the tenth to the fourteenth sutras of the eighth Samavaya, from the twelfth to the seventeenth sutras of the ninth Samavaya, from the tenth to the twenty-second sutras of the tenth Samavaya, from the eighth to the thirteenth sutras of the eleventh Samavaya, up to the twelfth sutra of the twelfth Samavaya, from the ninth to the fourteenth sutras of the thirteenth Samavaya, from the ninth to the fifteenth sutras of the fourteenth Samavaya, from the eighth to the fourteenth sutras of the fifteenth Samavaya, from the eighth to the thirteenth sutras of the sixteenth Samavaya, from the eleventh to the eighteenth sutras of the seventeenth Samavaya, from the ninth to the fifteenth sutras of the eighteenth Samavaya, from the sixth to the twelfth sutras of the nineteenth Samavaya,

_ In this way, the subject matter of the Samavayanga is so vast that it has been discussed in many places in the Agamic literature. In some places in the Agamas, the Sutra style has been used, while in other places, the Vyasa style has also been used to explain to the inquisitive. In the above lines, we have thought about the main topics of the Samavayanga, which are found in the Agamas, with evidence. Thus, the topics of Dasavaikalika, Nandi, Dasashrutaskandha and Kalpasutra also coincide with some of the Samavayanga, but since their number is not large, we have not mentioned them here, nor have we compared the topics with non-Agamic texts.
The topics of the Samavayanga can also be easily compared with the topics of Vedic and Buddhist texts. Thus, they have been mentioned briefly in their respective places. Today there is a need to study the Agamic literature comparatively with other literature. If the attention of the great thinkers is focused on this, then many doors of harmony and truth can be opened.
Commentary Literature
The Samavayanga Sutra does not contain deep philosophical riddles, nor does it contain profound discussions on spirituality. Whatever topics are presented are simple, easy and understandable, which is why no commentaries have been written on it, nor has any commentary been created, nor have any churnis been composed. Acharya Abhaydeva, the first commentator of the Navangi, created a commentary on it. This commentary is neither too short nor too long. At the beginning of the commentary, the Acharya has saluted Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira, because Bhagwan Mahavira is the one who reveals the meaning of this present Agam. Acharya Abhaydeva has written to the wise 758. Anuyogadvara Sutra - Sutra 139
[104]

Page #108:
---------------------------
It is requested that I lack the tradition of meaning that reveals the profound secrets of the Agamas before me, therefore, if there is any opposite interpretation of meaning anywhere, please do me the favor of refining it.
In the commentary, the Acharya has also explained the word "Samavaya". While explaining, he has also mentioned the variations in the text at many places. 760 The Prajnapana Sutra and the commentary of Gandhasti are also mentioned. This commentary was written in 1120 VS in Anahilapatan. Its volume is 3575 verses.
The revered Shri Ghasilalji M. is the one who wrote the second Sanskrit commentary on this Agama. 61 He has created the commentary following Acharya Abhaydev. This commentary is of its own kind. At some places, the commentator has changed the text from his point of view for the consistency of meaning. For example, the names of the Tirthankaras who will be in the future Utsarpini have been changed. 62 In our view, there can be no objection to the author giving his independent views in the commentary or discussion, but changing the original texts makes their authenticity disappear. Therefore, it is not appropriate to change the texts.
Acharya Amolkarishiji M. was the first to translate Samavayangasutra into Hindi. He has done great service to the scriptures by translating thirty-two Agamas into Hindi. 63
Panditpravar Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya 64 has done an important translation in Gujarati language. This translation is not a translation but a unique creation. Malvaniya ji's scholarship is evident everywhere. The notes he has given along with this translation are indicative of his serious study. This edition is very useful for researchers.
Panditpravar Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji "Kamal" has published Samavayanga with Hindi translation. The appendix section of the book is important. This edition is beneficial for the inquisitive. 065
Acharya Abhaydev's commentary was first published in 1880 by Rai Bahadur Dhanpatsinghji. After that, in 1919, a new edition was published by the Agamoday Committee, Surat.
In 138, Mafatlal Jhaverchand printed an edition with commentary from Ahmedabad. In Vikram Samvat 1995, an edition with Gujarati translation was also published by the Jain Dharma Pracharak Sabha, Bhavnagar.
This Agama is also published along with other Anga Agamas like "Suttagame" 766 Angasuttani 67, Angapavitthani 68, etc., only in the form of the original text. 759. Samavayanga Vritti 1-2 760. Instead of "Jambuddive Dive Egam Joyanasayasahassan Aayaayavikkhambhenam", the text "Jambuddive Deve Egam Joyanasayasahassan Chakkavalavikkhambhenam" etc. is found. "Navaram Jambuddive Iha Sutre" "Aayaayavikkhambhenam" ti Kwachit Paatho Drishyate Kwachitu "Chakkavalavikbhenam ti.....॥"

In addition to these editions, the enlightened Acharya Shri Dharmsingh Muni of the Jain community of Sthanakvasi had written a commentary on Samvayanga, clarifying the original meaning of the words, but it is still unpublished.
This edition
In this way, editions of the Samvayanga Sutra are published from time to time. The chief editor of this edition is Shraman Sangh's brilliant young Acharya Shri Madhukar Muni Ji M. Under your able leadership, the Agam-Prakashan-Samiti is engaged in publishing magnificent editions of the Agams. Many Agams have been published in a short period of time. Since the editor and commentator of each Agam are different individuals, the uniformity that should have been in the series of books has not been able to come. It cannot come either, because each person has his own independent writing and editing style. However, the young Acharya Shri has taken up this great task. In the conferences of the Shraman Sangh and the Sthanakvasi Conference, efforts have been made for a long time to have a new publication of Agam-Battissi. I am extremely delighted that the young Acharya Shri, a classmate and affectionate associate of my most revered Sadguru Shri Pushkar Muni Ji M., the Adhyatmayogi of Rajasthan, has taken up this task with a firm resolve to complete it very soon. This is a matter of pride. It is our duty to give him full cooperation and make this work more and more original.
The editor and commentator of Samvayanga is Pandit Shri Hiralalji Shastri. Pandit Hiralalji Shastri was a well-known and respected literary figure of the Digambar Jain tradition. He had edited many Digambar texts and displayed his brilliance. In the twilight of his life, he edited the great Agams Sthananga and Samvayanga of the Svetambar tradition. Sthananga has been published earlier from this series of Agams. Now the Samvayanga Sutra edited by him is being published. Due to old age, he could not work as much as he wanted. And due to some differences in tradition, he could not explain the subject completely. I have tried to fulfill all those topics in my introduction. However, the original meaning-based translation and the brief commentary given wherever necessary are clear indicators of his scholarship.
The editing skills of the pen-wielding Pandit Shobhachandji Bharill, who is a deep scholar of Svetambar Agams, are easily seen here and there. In fact, the laborious work that Bharillji is doing to make the Agams the most beautiful and authentic is a sign of his devotion to the Agams.
While writing the introduction of Samvayanga, many obstacles arose. The biggest obstacle was the sudden demise of the revered Matheshwari Sadhviratna Mahasati Shri Prabhavatiji, a gifted scholar of Agams and philosophy, on January 27, 1982, along with Santhare. A mother's love is unique. The kindness of parents cannot be forgotten. How can one forget the great kindness of the Matheshwari who not only gave me birth but also inspired me to walk on the path of sadhana? However, the living image of duty has this heartfelt blessing: 'Vats! Do a lot of Shrutaseva!' With that strength, I have written these lines of the introduction. I hope this Agam will be very popular and this edition will be very useful for those who love to study.

##  The Twelve Angas of Jainism

**4] The Samvayanga Sutra**

The Samvayanga Sutra, one of the twelve Angas, is a Jain scripture that explains how to conquer the passions (kṣayās) and become a Jina (conqueror). It also guides others on the path to liberation from the passions and achieving victory over them. It describes the path to liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and how to guide others to liberation. It explains how to attain enlightenment (bodhi) and how to guide others to enlightenment. It teaches how to be free from karma and how to liberate others from karma. It describes the Jinas as omniscient (sarvajña) and all-seeing (sarvadarśī) because they know everything in the universe and see everything in all the worlds. They attain the supreme state of liberation (siddhā-gati), which is characterized by being unshakeable, free from sorrow, free from disease, infinite, imperishable, free from obstacles, and free from rebirth.

**The Twelve Angas**

The twelve Angas, as described by Lord Mahavira, are:

1. **Ācārāṅga:** This Anga discusses the five types of conduct (ācāra) for the monks: knowledge, perception, conduct, austerity, and effort.
2. **Sūtrakṛtāṅga:** This Anga discusses one's own views (svamata), the views of others (paramata), and the views of both oneself and others (svaparamata). It also explains the nine substances: living beings (jīva), non-living beings (ajīva), merit (puṇya), demerit (pāpa), inflow (āsrava), restraint (samvara), stoppage (nirjarā), bondage (bandha), and liberation (mokṣa).
3. **Stānāṅga:** This Anga describes the different categories of substances or entities, from one to ten, using the concept of "places" (sthāna).
4. **Samvayāṅga:** This Anga describes the different categories of substances or entities, from one to thousands, using the concept of "groups" (samvāya).
5. **Vyākhyāprajñapti-aṅga:** This Anga contains the 36,000 questions asked by the Ganadharas (disciples) and the answers given by Lord Mahavira.
6. **Jñātādharmkathāṅga:** This Anga discusses the stories of virtuous individuals who have overcome the obstacles (pariṣaha-upasarga) and the narratives of righteous individuals.
7. **Upāsakadāśāṅga:** This Anga describes the ten great lay followers (mahāśrāvaka) who diligently followed the highest principles of Jainism and practiced the ritual of Sanlekhanā (voluntary death) at the end of their lives.
8. **Antakṛtdāśāṅga:** This Anga describes the great ascetics (anagara) who endured severe obstacles (pariṣaha-upasarga) and attained omniscience (kevala-jñāna), ending their karma within a very short time.
9. **Anuttaraupapātika-daśāṅga:** This Anga describes the ascetics (anagara) who endured severe obstacles (pariṣaha-upasarga) and attained liberation (mokṣa) by dying in a state of meditation, being reborn in one of the five highest heavens (anuttaramāhāvimāna).
10. **Praśnavyākaraṇāṅga:** This Anga discusses questions related to one's own time (svakāla), the time of others (parakāla), and the time of both oneself and others (svaparakāla). It also includes mantras (sacred chants).

Page #124:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**5. Ekasthanak-Samavay**

This chapter describes the means of attaining knowledge and its excellences.

**11. Vipaksutraang**

This chapter narrates the character of sinful individuals who commit great sins and suffer terrible consequences, as well as the character of virtuous individuals who accumulate great merit and enjoy worldly happiness as a result.

**12. Drishtivadaang**

This chapter extensively discusses mathematics, 363 other doctrines, fourteen Purvas, the biographies of great souls, and five Chulikaas (water-born, sky-born, etc.) through the five great authorities: Parikaram, Sutra, Purva, Anuyog, and Chulika. In fact, this Drishtivadaang is the largest of the twelve angas.

The term "Ganipitaka" for the twelve angas signifies that just as a merchant keeps his valuable goods safe in a pitari, peti, manjusha, or, in today's terms, a box or a chest, similarly, this Ganipitaka, belonging to the Acharya, the master of the Sangha (community of monks and nuns), serves as a safe repository for the invaluable teachings of the Lord in the form of the twelve angas.

**2. Tattha Nam Je Se Chautthe Ange Samavae Tti Ahite Tass Nam Ayamdhe Panatte.**

This Samavayang is called the fourth anga in the Ganipitaka, the twelve angas. Its meaning is as follows:

**Explanation:**

This anga is aptly named "Samavay" because it helps in understanding the correct nature of things through the knowledge of their specific number and characteristics.

**000**

**Ekasthanak-Samavay 3-Age Aya, Age Anaya. Age Dande, Age Adande. Ega Kiriya, Ega Akiriya. Age Loe, Age Aloe. Age Dhamme, Age Adhamme. Age Punne, Age Pave. Age Bandhe, Age Mokkhe. Age Asave, Age Sanvare. Ega Veyana, Ega Nijjara.**

_The soul is one, the non-soul is one, punishment is one, non-punishment is one, action is one, inaction is one, the world is one, the non-world is one, righteous conduct is one, unrighteous conduct is one, merit is one, sin is one, bondage is one, liberation is one, inflow is one, restraint is one, pain is one, and cessation is one._

**Explanation:**

Although there are many substances like soul, non-soul, etc. (inanimate pudgala, etc.), their unity is stated in these sutras with respect to their essence. This is because all living beings are countless in number, but they are one in terms of the essence of life. Or, they are one in terms of their conscious nature, which extends through all three times. Similarly, inanimate substances like pots, pans, etc., which are different from the soul and non-soul, are one in terms of their common characteristic of being inanimate. Punishment, i.e., all kinds of sins like violence, etc., are forms of wrong tendencies of mind, speech, and body. Therefore, punishment is also one. Non-violence or righteous tendencies of mind, speech, and body are also one.

Page #125:
---------------------------
From the Samvayanga Sutra, even Adanda is one. Similarly, one should know that all these mutually opposite or relative substances, such as action-inaction, world-non-world, righteous-unrighteous, merit-demerit, bondage-liberation, inflow-restriction, pain and exhaustion, are all one due to having the same dharma in terms of collection. In Jain philosophy, all statements are made in relation to Nayas. In this first chapter of Samvayanga, all statements have been made in one form in relation to collection.
4-The Jambudvipa island is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. The Palaka Vimana, a vehicle of the Saudharma Indra, is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. The Sarvarthasiddha Maha Vimana is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth.
Jambudvipa, the first island, is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. The Palaka Vimana, a vehicle of the Saudharma Indra, is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. The Sarvarthasiddha Maha Vimana is said to be one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth.
_ Meaning-Jambudvipa, Palaka Vimana and Sarvarthasiddha Maha Vimana are all one hundred thousand yojanas in size.
5-The Ardra constellation is said to have one star. The Chitra constellation is said to have one star. The Swati constellation is said to have one star.
6-In this Ratnapraba earth, the state of many Narakas is said to be one Palyopama. In this Ratnapraba earth, the state of many Narakas is said to be one Sagaropama. In the second Sharkara earth, the state of Narakas is said to be one Sagaropama. The state of many Asurakumaras is said to be one Palyopama.

[Tri-Sthanak-Samavay]
Those who are Bhava-Siddhi-Jiva, who will become Siddha, Buddha, liberated from karma, attain Nirvana, and end all suffering by taking two Bhava-grahana.
Those Devas who are born in the Sudharma-Avatamsaka Vimanas, which are distinguished by their auspiciousness, auspiciousness, auspiciousness, auspiciousness, auspiciousness, and auspiciousness, are said to be in an excellent state, like two oceans. These Devas take one breath or exhale in two half-months (one month). They develop a desire for food in two thousand years. How many Bhavyasiddhi-Jiva are there who will become Siddha, Buddha, liberated from karma, attain Nirvana, and end all suffering by taking two Bhava-grahana?
|| Dvi-Sthanak Samavay Sampt.
Tri-Sthanak-Samavay 15 - There are three Dandas, namely - Man-Danda, Vachan-Danda, Kaya-Danda. There are three Gupptis, namely - Man-Guppti, Vachan-Guppti, Kaya-Guppti. There are three Sallas, namely - Maya-Sall, Niyan-Sall, Miccha-Dasan-Sall. There are three Garavas, namely - Iddi-Garava, Ras-Garava, Saya-Garava. There are three Viradhanas, namely - Nan-Viradhana, Dassan-Viradhana, Charitra-Viradhana.
Explanation - That by which the wealth of character is destroyed is called Danda. The character is destroyed by the wrong tendencies of mind, speech, and body, hence there are three types of Danda. Since the suppression of the evil tendencies of mind, speech, and body, and the performance of good tendencies, is called Guppti, hence there are three types of Guppti. Those who pierce the body, enter within, and cause pain in the inner self, like arrows, are called Salyas. The Maya of the Maya-chari continues to torment him, lest his Maya or deceit be revealed. The second Saly is Nidana. Seeing the wealth and prosperity of Devas, etc., and desiring them as a result of one's own penance, is called Nidana. The mind of the one who does Nidana is always burning with the desire to obtain those pleasures, etc., hence Nidana is also called Saly. The third Saly is Miccha-Darshan. Under its influence, the Jiva is always restless with the desire to obtain external objects. To desire external objects is Miccha-Darshan, hence it is called Saly. To make one's own soul great or heavy by pride, greed, etc., is called Garava. To consider oneself great by wealth and prosperity, etc., is called Iddi-Garava. To feel proud of eating ghee, milk, sweets, etc., and to feel proud of obtaining them, is called Ras-Garava. To declare one's own comfort, such as, "I cannot bear these trials and tribulations, I cannot bear the cold and heat," or to feel proud of obtaining wealth, is called Saya-Garava. Knowledge, vision

Six Leshyās have been mentioned. For example: Krishna Leshya, Nila Leshya, Kapota Leshya, Tejo Leshya, Padma Leshya, Shukla Leshya.

**Discussion:**

The culmination of the soul due to the arising of passions (Kashāyas) in their intense and mild forms, in conjunction with the substances like Krishna, etc., is called Leshya. When the passions arise very intensely, the resulting extremely agitated and fierce states are called Krishna Leshya. The agitated states that arise from a lesser intensity of passions are called Nila Leshya. The states of sorrow and contemplation that arise from a further decrease in the intensity of passions are called Kapota Leshya. When the passions arise mildly, the auspicious results of giving charity, helping others, etc., are called Tejo Leshya. When the passions arise even more mildly, the awakening of discernment, calmness, and emotions are called Padma Leshya. When the passions arise very mildly, the resulting purity is called Shukla Leshya.

Humans and animals experience changes in their Leshyās within the blink of an eye. However, the Leshyās of gods and hell beings remain constant. Nevertheless, they fluctuate within their limits. The color of the body is called Dravya Leshya. It has no inseparable connection with Bhava Leshya.

**[Six Jīvanikāya Paṇṇattā, Tam Jahā-Puḍhavīkāye Āūkāye Teukāye Vāukāye Vaṇass'aikāye Tasakāye.]**

Six categories of existence (Jīvanikāya) have been mentioned. For example: Earth-bodied (Pṛthvīkāya), Water-bodied (Apakāya), Fire-bodied (Tejaskāya), Air-bodied (Vāyukāya), Plant-bodied (Vaṇaspattikāya), and Animal-bodied (Trasakāya).

**[Chhavvihe Bāhire Tavokamme Paṇṇatte, Tam Jahā-Aṇasane Ūṇoyariya Vittisankhevo Rasaparicchāo Kāyakileso Sanlīṇayā.]**

Six types of external austerities (Tavokamme) have been mentioned. For example: Fasting (Aṇasane), Eating less (Ūṇoyariya), Limiting one's activities (Vittisankhevo), Renouncing flavors (Rasaparicchāo), Body-mortification (Kāyakileso), and Solitude (Sanlīṇayā).

**[Chhavvihe Abhintere Tavokamme Paṇṇatte, Tam Jahā-Pāyachchittan Viṇo Veyāvaccan Sajjhāo Jhāṇan Ussaggo.]**

Six types of internal austerities have been mentioned. For example: Atonement (Pāyachchittan), Humility (Viṇo), Self-reflection (Veyāvaccan), Study (Sajjhāo), Meditation (Jhāṇan), and Renunciation (Ussaggo).

**Discussion:**

Out of the six categories of existence, the first five are stationary and single-sensed. The two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, five-sensed animals, as well as humans, gods, and hell beings are called animal-bodied (Trasakāya).

Austerities that lead to the destruction of karma through the depletion of the external body are called external austerities. Renouncing all four types of food for life or a fixed period is called fasting (Aṇasane). Eating less than one's hunger is called eating less (Ūṇoyariya). Following the rules of conduct and accepting various types of possessions is called limiting one's activities (Vittisankhevo). Renouncing all six flavors or one, two, etc., flavors is called renouncing flavors (Rasaparicchāo). Enduring cold, heat, and various types of postures to make the body thin is called body-mortification (Kāyakileso). Living in solitude and restraining the senses is called solitude (Sanlīṇayā).

Austerities that lead to the destruction of karma through the restraint of internal mental tendencies are called internal austerities.

**Penance Tapping**

[Samvayanga Sutra 1]

Penance tapping is the act of performing penance or appropriate austerities for offenses committed due to ignorance, carelessness, or the influence of passions.

**Humility Tapping**

Humility tapping is the act of abandoning ego and pride and maintaining a humble attitude.

**Reverence Tapping**

Reverence tapping is the act of showing devotion to gurus, serving the sick, and alleviating their suffering.

**Self-Study Tapping**

Self-study tapping is the act of reading, studying, listening to, contemplating, and preaching scriptures.

**Meditation Tapping**

Meditation is the act of focusing the mind on dharma and spirituality, abandoning agitated and angry thoughts.

**Renunciation Tapping**

Renunciation tapping is the act of abandoning external things like the body and internal passions like attachment.

**External tappings** are performed to enhance internal tappings. **Internal tappings** are infinitely more beneficial due to their ability to destroy karma.

**Six Types of Expansions**

[Samvayanga Sutra 32]

Six types of expansions are mentioned:

* **Pain Expansion:** Expansion due to pain.
* **Passion Expansion:** Expansion due to intense passions like anger.
* **Death Expansion:** Expansion before death.
* **Action Expansion:** Expansion during the formation of a new body or during the manifestation of powers like levitation and invisibility.
* **Luminous Expansion:** Expansion due to the use of luminous power.
* **Food Expansion:** Expansion of a hand-shaped effigy from the head of a great sage when they have a deep doubt about a certain topic and there is no Kevali (omniscient being) present in that area. This effigy travels to the Kevali, touches their feet, and returns to the sage, resolving their doubt.

**Explanation:**

All beings are called **"Chhadmastha"** (veiled) until they attain Kevalgyan (omniscience). The expansion of Chhadmastha beings is called **"Chhadmasthik Samudghat"**.

**Samudghat** refers to the outward projection of certain parts of a being due to some cause. There are seven types of Samudghat mentioned in the scriptures. Except for Kevali Samudghat, the remaining six types occur in Chhadmastha beings.

**Pain Expansion:** When a being is suffering from pain, certain parts of their being project outwards.

**Passion Expansion:** When a being is experiencing intense passions like anger, certain parts of their being project outwards.

**Death Expansion:** Before death, certain parts of a being project outwards.

**Action Expansion:** When a being is forming a new body or manifesting powers like levitation and invisibility, certain parts of their being expand.

**Luminous Expansion:** When a being uses luminous power, certain parts of their being project outwards.

**Food Expansion:** When a great sage has a deep doubt about a certain topic and there is no Kevali present in that area, a hand-shaped effigy emerges from their head and travels to the Kevali. This effigy touches the Kevali's feet and returns to the sage, resolving their doubt.

**Note:**

The duration of all these expansions is only one **"Antarmukhurta"** (a very short period of time). The parts that project outwards during these expansions remain connected to the original body.

**Six Types of Meaning Comprehension**

[Samvayanga Sutra 33]

Six types of meaning comprehension are mentioned:

* **Auditory Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the ear.
* **Visual Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the eye.
* **Olfactory Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the nose.
* **Gustatory Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the tongue.
* **Tactile Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the skin.
* **No-Indriyal Meaning Comprehension:** Comprehension through the mind.

**Explanation:**

When a being perceives an object, the initial, subtle understanding that arises after the perception is called **"Vyanjanavagraha"**. The subsequent understanding of the meaning or the general knowledge of the object is called **"Arthavagraha"**. This Arthavagraha occurs through the five senses (ear, eye, nose, tongue, skin) and the mind (No-Indriyal).

Page #136:
---------------------------
## Six Standpoints - Agreement

[17]
Since it arises from the mind, it has six divisions. But the understanding of the meaning is only of four types, because it does not arise from the eye sense or the mind, because both of these are incapable of grasping, they do not have contact with the object of perception. Only after the understanding of the meaning, do knowledge like desire, aversion, etc. arise.

[34]
The Krittika constellation is said to have six stars. The Ashlesha constellation is said to have six stars.

[35]
In this Ratnaprabha earth, the state of many hell beings is said to be six Palyopama. In the third Balukaprabha earth, the state of many hell beings is said to be six Sagaropama. The state of many Asura Kumaras is said to be six Palyopama. In the Saudharma - Ishana kalpas, the state of many gods is said to be six Palyopama.

## Chapter 20

**44**

Eight *madastanas* (sources of pride) are mentioned, such as: *jatimda* (pride in one's mother's lineage), *kulmada* (pride in one's father's lineage), *balmada* (pride in one's strength), *rupmada* (pride in one's beauty), *tapomda* (pride in one's austerities), *srutamada* (pride in one's knowledge), *labhmada* (pride in one's wealth), and *aishwarymada* (pride in one's power).

Eight *pravchan-matas* (mothers of the teachings) are mentioned, such as: *iryasamiti* (the assembly of those who walk), *bhasasamiti* (the assembly of those who speak), *eshanasamiti* (the assembly of those who desire), *adana-bhanda-matra-nikshepanasamiti* (the assembly of those who deposit only the necessary amount of food and other necessities), *uccara-prastavana-khel-jall-singhana-parishthapanasamiti* (the assembly of those who engage in play, laughter, singing, and dancing), *manogupti* (guarding the mind), *vachanagupti* (guarding the speech), and *kayagupti* (guarding the body).

**Explanation:**

The places or reasons from which a person develops pride or arrogance are called *madastanas*. There are eight of them. Pride in proficiency or skill in various arts should be understood as falling under *srutamada*. The term *pravchan* refers to the twelve-fold *ganipitaka* and its foundational assembly. Just as a mother protects her child, so too do the five assemblies and three guardians protect the twelve-fold *pravchan* and the assembly, which is the embodiment of restraint and Dharma. Therefore, they are called *pravchan-matas*.

**45**

The *chaitya-vruksha* (sacred trees) of the *vanavyantara* (intermediate gods) are said to be eight *yojanas* (leagues) high. The *jambhu* tree, located in *uttarakuru* (northern Kuru), is said to be eight *yojanas* high. The *kutasalmalli* tree, located in *devakuru* (divine Kuru) and the abode of Garuda, is said to be eight *yojanas* high. The *jagati* (boundary wall) of *jambudvipa* (the Jambudvipa continent) is said to be eight *yojanas* high.

**46**

The *kevalisamudghata* (the complete liberation of the soul) is said to have eight stages. In the first stage, the *kevali* (liberated soul) performs the *danda-samudghata* (the liberation of the body from the bondage of the senses). In the second stage, the *kevali* performs the *kapaata-samudghata* (the liberation of the mind from the bondage of the senses). In the third stage, the *kevali* performs the *manthana-samudghata* (the liberation of the soul from the bondage of the senses). In the fourth stage, the *kevali* fills the intervals of the *manthana-samudghata* (the liberation of the soul from the bondage of the senses). In the fifth stage, the *kevali* contracts the intervals of the *manthana-samudghata* (the liberation of the soul from the bondage of the senses). In the sixth stage, the *kevali* contracts the *manthana-samudghata* (the liberation of the soul from the bondage of the senses). In the seventh stage, the *kevali* contracts the *kapaata-samudghata* (the liberation of the mind from the bondage of the senses). In the eighth stage, the *kevali* contracts the *danda-samudghata* (the liberation of the body from the bondage of the senses). After this, the soul becomes as small as a body.

**47**

The *arhat* (liberated soul) who is a *purishadaani* (a human being) has eight *ganas* (groups) and eight *ganaharas* (leaders of the groups).

In the Agamas, these are also known as the nine fences of virtue. Just as the fence of a field is its protector, in the same way, the above nine fences are the protectors of Brahmacharya, therefore they are called Brahmacharya - secrets.

[Ten-Place Aggregates]
[25 Ten-Place Aggregates 61. Ten Saman Dharma (Ascetic Virtues) are stated, such as- Patience 1, Liberation 2, Uprightness 3, Gentleness 4, Lightness 5, Truthfulness 6, Restraint 7, Austerity 8, Renunciation 9, Brahmacharya 10.
Ascetic virtues are said to be of ten kinds, such as- Patience 1, Liberation 2, Uprightness 3, Gentleness 4, Lightness 5, Truthfulness 6, Restraint 7, Austerity 8, Renunciation 9, Brahmacharya 10.
Explanation- Those who renounce the beginning-acquisition and home-door and take up restraint and continuously strive for its flawless observance are called "Ascetics". They are advised to observe the ten virtues of patience etc. to conquer their passions. The most prominent passion is anger. To conquer it, it is essential to cultivate patience, tolerance or forgiveness. The lifelong restraint-practice of great ascetics like Dwipayana was destroyed by a moment of anger and they attained downfall. The second powerful passion is greed, to renounce it, it is necessary to observe the virtue of liberation, i.e., non-greed. Similarly, to conquer the passion of delusion, the virtue of uprightness is prescribed and to conquer the passion of pride, the virtue of gentleness is prescribed. By conquering the passion of pride, the virtue of lightness automatically manifests. And by conquering the passion of delusion, the virtue of truthfulness also manifests. To restrain the tendency of the five senses towards their objects, the observance of the four virtues of restraint, austerity, renunciation and Brahmacharya is advised. Here, renunciation refers to the renunciation of all kinds of attachments (acquisition), both internal and external. Giving is also called renunciation. Therefore, the giving of alms from the alms received by the sincere and pleasing ascetics is also considered to be the duty of the ascetics. The complete observance of the ascetic virtues is possible only by residing with the great ascetics who are the upholders of Brahmacharya, therefore, it is given the last place.
62- Ten states of mind-absorption are stated, such as- The arising of the thought of Dharma, which had not arisen before, knowing all Dharma, is the first state of the arising of mind-absorption or peace (1).

Page #145:
---------------------------
[26]
The **Samvayanga Sutra** states that **Dharma-Chinta** (reflection on Dharma) is the first stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** (mental absorption) because it is only through this that knowledge and practice of Dharma become possible.

The second stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to see a **Yatharthya** (realistic) dream, which is like nothing seen before, and which will bear fruit in the future (2).

The third stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to have **Sanjijnana** (knowledge of birth) which remembers a previous life, something that has never happened before. Remembering a previous life awakens a state of supreme peace in the mind, along with emotions of detachment and dispassion (3).

The fourth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to see the **Devas** (divine beings), their divine splendor, their families, their powers, their divine radiance (of their bodies and ornaments), and their divine influence (the effects of their superior actions). This is because seeing the Devas inspires firm faith in Dharma (4).

The fifth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to develop **Avadhijnana** (clairvoyance), which directly perceives the **Lokas** (material objects), something that has never happened before. When **Avadhijnana** arises, an unprecedented peace and joy manifest in the mind (5).

The sixth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to develop **Avadhidarshan** (clairvoyance), which directly sees the **Lokas**, something that has never happened before (6).

The seventh stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to develop **Manahparyayajnana** (knowledge of the minds of others), which knows the mental states of all beings within the **Ardha-dvipa-samudravarti** (half-continent-ocean-surrounded) realm, who have five senses and are capable of experiencing the world, something that has never happened before (7).

The eighth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to develop **Kevalajnana** (omniscience), which directly knows the entire **Lokas** (universe) with all its **Trikalavartis** (past, present, and future) aspects, something that has never happened before (8).

The ninth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to develop **Kevaladarshan** (omniscient vision), which sees the entire **Lokas** (universe) of all mobile and immobile beings, something that has never happened before (9).

The tenth stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** is to die a **Kevalimaran** (omniscient death), which destroys all suffering. This is the final stage of **Chitta-Samadhi** (10).

Upon reaching this stage, the soul is liberated from all worldly suffering, becomes a **Siddh** (liberated being), and attains infinite bliss.

63-The **Mandara** (Mount Meru) is said to have a diameter of ten thousand **Yojanas** at its base.

64-The **Arishthanemi** Tirthankara was ten **dhanus** (bows) tall. **Krishna Vasudeva** was ten **dhanus** tall. **Rama Balarama** was ten **dhanus** tall.

The Sanskrit commentator, mentioning a different opinion, has designated the abandonment of the beginning as the ninth, the abandonment of the beginning of the messenger as the tenth, and the Shraman-Bhut who abandons the designated food as the eleventh pratima. And in the fifth pratima, it is said to observe the one-night pratima-yoga on the day of the festival.

In the Digambar scriptures, the abandonment of attachment is called the fifth pratima and the abandonment of the enjoyment of women and the adoption of celibacy is called the seventh pratima. And the ninth pratima is called the abandonment of possessions and the tenth pratima is called the abandonment of permitted things. In the Svetambar sect, the tradition of observing the pratima has been discontinued. But in the Digambar sect, it is still prevalent. The duration of these Shravak pratima is one, two, three, etc., months. That is, the duration of the first pratima is one month, the second is two months, the third is three months, the fourth is four, and so on, the eleventh is eleven months. According to the Digambar tradition, these are observed for life.

**72**- The Jyotishchakra is said to be situated at a distance of eleven hundred and eleven yojanas from the Lokanta. In the island called Jambudvipa, the Jyotishchakra travels at a distance of eleven hundred and twenty-one (1121) yojanas from the Mandar mountain.

**73**- The Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira had eleven Ganadharas - Indrabhuti, Agnibhuti, Vayubhuti, Vyakt, Sudharma, Mandit, Mauryaputra, Akampit, Achalbhrata, Metary and Prabhas.

**74**- The Mula Nakshatra is said to have eleven stars. The Vimanas of the Adhastana Graiveyak-Devas are said to be one hundred and eleven (111). The Mandar mountain is said to be eleven parts less than the height from the earth to the peak.

[It is said to be 31 in extent.
In the Vivechan-Mandar Meru, which is one lakh yojanas high, one thousand yojanas are within the earth in its original form, and it is ninety-nine (99) thousand yojanas high above the earth, and it is ten thousand yojanas wide on the earth and one thousand yojanas wide at the peak. Since 11 x 9 = 99, therefore, going up eleven yojanas from the part of the earth which is ten thousand yojanas wide, its width decreases by one yojana, according to this rule, going up ninety-nine thousand yojanas, the peak of Mount Sumeru is proved to be one thousand yojanas wide. Keeping this rule in mind, the width of the peak of Mount Mandar is said to be less than the eleventh part of the width of its earth.
75-In this Ratnaprabha earth, the state of many Narakas is said to be eleven Palyopama. In the fifth Dhumaprabha earth, the state of many Narakas is said to be eleven Sagaropama.

**Twelve Stations - Samvaya**

77 - Twelve types of Bhikkhu-pratima have been stated, such as - Ekmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Domaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Trimaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Chaumaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Panchmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Chhamaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Satmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Prathama Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Dvitiya Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Tartiya Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Ahoratraika Bhikkhu-pratima, and Ekaratraika Bhikkhu-pratima.

[Samvayanga Sutra
Twelve Bhikkhu-pratima have been stated, such as - Ekmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Domaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Trimaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Chaumaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Panchmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Chhamaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Satmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima, Prathama Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Dvitiya Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Tartiya Saptaatraindya Bhikkhu-pratima, Ahoratraika Bhikkhu-pratima, and Ekaratraika Bhikkhu-pratima.
Discussion - Sadhus who receive food by begging are called Bhikkhus. Among the general Bhikkhus, those who are special in their concentration and knowledge of scriptures, who accept specific restrictions to practice specific austerities, are called Bhikkhu-pratima. This Sutra mentions that there are twelve of them. The Sanskrit commentator has not shed much light on them, therefore, according to the seventh Dasha of Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, their description is given briefly.
-
Ekmaasiki Bhikkhu-pratima - The Bhikkhu who follows this pratima has to endure all the insults from Devas, humans, and animals for one month, giving up attachment to the body. He takes only one Datti of pure, faultless food and drink for one month. One Datti is the food or water given in one continuous offering. He does not accept food or drink from the hands of pregnant women, women with young children, women breastfeeding, or sick women. He goes out for begging only in the first part of the day and returns after begging in Peda, Ardha-Peda, etc. He does not stay anywhere for more than one or two nights. While traveling, wherever the sun sets, he stays there for the night, under a tree, or in a garden, house, fort, or mountain, on even or uneven ground, in a cave or valley, whichever is available nearby. If a thorn pricks his foot, or something gets into his eye, or a weapon enters his body, he does not remove it with his hand. He does not sleep deeply at night, but spends the night sitting, taking short naps through sleep-induced trance, contemplating himself, and sets out in the morning. He does not wash his hands, feet, face, teeth, eyes, or other parts of his body with cold or hot water. While traveling, if a lion, cheetah, tiger, or any other ferocious animal, or an elephant, horse, buffalo, or any other mad animal comes in front of him, he does not take a single step back, but stands there. When those animals leave, he continues his journey. If the sun shines brightly where he is sitting, he does not get up and go to a place with cool shade. Similarly, he does not get up from a cold place and go to a warm place.

[33] Thus, he abides by the prescribed limits of the Agamas.
From the second to the seventh-monthly Bhikshu-pratima, all the monks who hold these pratima must also abide by all the duties of the first-monthly pratima holder. The difference is that the one who holds the second Bhikshu-pratima takes two portions of food and drink daily for two months. Similarly, increasing one portion at a time, the one who holds the seventh-monthly Bhikshu-pratima takes seven portions of food and drink daily for seven months.
The monk who holds the first seven-night-day Bhikshu-pratima, observes the rule of the fourth bhakta, standing or sitting outside the village.
The one who holds the second seven-night-day Bhikshu-pratima, observes the rule of the sixth bhakta, remaining in a posture like utkut (squatting) etc. The one who holds the third seven-night-day pratima, observes the rule of the eighth bhakta, remaining in a posture like godohan or virasana etc. for seven days and nights. The one who holds the day-and-night pratima, observes the rule of the sixth bhakta, remaining outside the village etc. for 24 hours, with kayotsarga. The one who holds the one-night Bhikshu-pratima, observes the rule of the eighth bhakta, remaining with kayotsarga, with pratima yoga, with unblinking eyes. 78
There are twelve types of sambhoga, as follows:
1. Upadhi-vishayaka sambhoga, 2. Shruta-vishayaka sambhoga, 3. Bhakta-pana-vishayaka sambhoga, 4. Anjali-pragraha sambhoga, 5. Dana-vishayaka sambhoga, 6. Nikachana-vishayaka sambhoga, 7. Abhyutthana-vishayaka sambhoga, 8. Kritikarma-karana sambhoga, 9. Vaiyaavrutya-karana sambhoga, 10. Samavasarana-sambhoga, 11. Sanni-shidya sambhoga, and 12. Katha-prabhandhana sambhoga. ||1-2||
Explanation - Sharing food and drink, exchanging clothes, utensils etc., and observing vinaya, vaiyaavrutya etc. according to the diksha-paryaya, is called sambhoga. It is said to be of twelve types, according to the difference in upadhi etc. The monk is ordained to accept un-assigned and faultless clothes, utensils, food and drink etc. If a monk accepts impure or faulty upadhi (clothes, utensils etc.) once, twice or thrice, he remains sambhogik by performing pratyachitta. On the fourth occasion of accepting impure clothes, utensils etc., even after performing pratyachitta, he becomes eligible for visambhoga. That is, other monks stop sharing food and drink with him and separate him from their group. Such a monk is called visambhogik.

**(2)** A *Samvāyik* is considered *Sambhogik* as long as they give *Śruta*-related teachings, such as reciting scriptures, to another *Sambhogik* *Samvāyik* in a blameless manner. If they violate this rule and give *Śruta*-related teachings to a *Pārśvastha* or other *Samvāyik* more than three times, they become *Visambhogik* as before. This is *Śruta*-related *Sambhog-Visambhog*.

**(3)** A *Samvāyik* is considered *Sambhogik* as long as they follow the blameless rules regarding *Bhakta-Pāna* (food and drink). If they violate these rules, they become eligible for *Visambhog*. This is *Bhakta-Pāna*-related *Sambhog-Visambhog*.

**(4)** *Samvāyik*s are required to greet each other with *Vandana* (salutation) and join their hands in *Namaskāra* (bowing) according to their *Dīkṣā-Paryāya* (stage of initiation). A *Samvāyik* is considered *Sambhogik* as long as they do not violate this rule and perform *Vandana* to *Pārśvastha* and other *Samvāyik*s. If they violate this rule, they become *Visambhogik*. This is *Anjali-Pragraha*-related *Sambhog-Visambhog*.

This is *Dāna*-related *Sambhog-Visambhog*.

**(6)** *Nikācana* means invitation. A *Samvāyik* is considered *Sambhogik* as long as they invite another *Sambhogik* *Samvāyik* to receive pure clothes, utensils, *Bhakta-Pāna*, etc. in a proper manner. If they violate this rule and invite a *Visambhogik* or a *Pārśvastha* or other *Samvāyik* to receive clothes, etc., they become eligible for *Visambhog* as before. This is *Nikācana*-related *Sambhog-Visambhog*.

## The Twelve Positions - Samvaya

[35]
The place where the Samvaya takes place is called Samvasarana.  The act of rising and sitting with the Samvogi Sadhus in a dignified manner is Samvasarana-related Samvoga.  However, if one sits with Asambhogi or Parsvastadi Sadhus in that place and violates the rules of conduct, then they become eligible for Visambhoga as before.

(11)  Rising from one's seat to ask questions from the Gurus, and rising from the seat to answer when asked by them, is Sanniṣadya-related Samvoga.  If a Sadhu asks a question from the Gurus while sitting on their seat, or does not rise from their seat to answer when asked by them, this violation of conduct makes them eligible for Visambhoga as before.

(12)  Following the rules of debate and discourse during discussions of Tattva or Dharmakatha with the Guru is Katha-Prabhandhana-related Samvoga.  When a Sadhu violates the rules of Katha-Prabhandhana, they become eligible for Visambhoga.  This is Katha-Prabhandhana-related Samvoga.

In essence, as long as a Sadhu follows the rules of conduct of their Sangha, they remain Samvogi, and upon violating them, they become eligible for Visambhoga.

79 - Duvalasavatte Kitikamme Panṇatte, Tam Jaha -
Duoyaṇayam Jahajāyam Kitikammṁ Bārasāvayṁ.

It has been said that there are twelve cycles in Kritikarma, such as:
In Kritikarma, there are two Avanta (prostrations), Yathajat form, twelve cycles, four Shironati (bowing of the head), three Gupti (covering), two Pravesa (entry), and one Niskraman (exit). ||1||

**Explanation:** The etymology of Kritikarma is - 'Kṛtyate Chidyate Karma Yena Tat Kritikarma', meaning that the action which cuts or severs the eight Karmas of Jnanavarana etc. through pure mental action, verbal action in the form of chanting, and physical action in the form of prostration, is called Kritikarma.  Therefore, even through the worship of Devas and Gurus, the destruction of Papkarma takes place, hence worship is called Kritikarma.

This verse in the text is a witness to the fact that there are twelve cycles in Kritikarma.  Regarding the meaning of cycle, the Sanskrit commentator has only written this much - 'Dvādaśāvartāḥ Sūtrābhidhānagarbhāḥ Kāyavyāpāraviśeṣāḥ Yatijanaprasiddhaḥ', meaning - the specific actions of the body, known to the Sadhu community, which are mentioned in the Sutras, are called cycles.  However, this does not clarify what this specific action of the body is, which is called a cycle.

In the Di. tradition, the act of joining both hands and rotating them from right to left is called a cycle.  These cycles are considered symbolic of the reflection of the action of the body and speech, which are part of Samayik Dandak.

The Samvayanga Sutra and the Chaturvinshati stava have twelve beginnings and endings in total.
The special secret of the cycle and the karma should be known from the tradition-prevalent method. The above verse is also found in the Mulachara with slight variations in the text.
80-The Vijay Rajdhani of the lord Vijay, the ruler of the Vijay Dwar in the east of Jambudweep, is said to be twelve lakh yojanas in length and breadth (from here an uncountable number of yojanas away). The Baldev named Ram attained divinity after living a full life of twelve hundred (1200) years. The base of the peak of the Mandar mountain is twelve yojanas in diameter. The base of the platform of the Jambudweep island is twelve yojanas in diameter.
81-The shortest night (Sarvajghanya Ratri) is twelve muhurtas long. Similarly, the shortest day should also be known to be twelve muhurtas long.
82-Twelve yojanas above the upper stupa (chulika) of the Sarvarthasiddha Maha-Vimana, a land called Ishatpraagbaar is said to exist. The Ishatpraagbaar earth is said to have twelve names, such as- Ishat Prithvi, Ishat Praagbaar Prithvi, Tanu Prithvi, Tanutari Prithvi, Siddhi Prithvi, Siddhalaya, Mukti, Muktalaya, Brahma, Brahmavatansak, Lokapratipoorna and Lokagrachulika.
83-Twelve palis are said to be the lifespan of the beings living on the earth with the radiance of the sun. Twelve sagaras are said to be the lifespan of the beings living on the fifth earth. Twelve palis are said to be the lifespan of the Asura Kumaras and the Devas. Twelve palis are said to be the lifespan of the Devas in the Sohammisana Kappas. 1. The twelve cycles of the body, speech and mind are mentioned.
The characteristics of the repetition of the stava, samayaika, etc. are as follows. || 13 || After rotating both hands three times, read it again. After reading the Samayaika, rotate both hands, and do the same in the stava. || 14 || (Action)

[41 In the Kriyavishal-Purva, a detailed description of various arts and mental, verbal, and physical actions has been given. In the Lokabindu-sar, the nature of the world and the subtle analysis of the three jewels of Dharma, which are the causes of liberation, has been done.
94 - The fourteen objects of the Aggrayaniya Purva have been stated. The excellent Shraman-sampada of the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira was of fourteen thousand Sadhus.
95 - Fourteen Jeeva-sthana have been stated in relation to the means of investigating the purification (elimination) of karma, such as - Mithyadrishti, Sasayan Samyagdristi, Samyagmithyadrishti, Avirat Samyagdristi, Viratavirat, Pramattasanyat, Apramattasanyat, Nivrittibaddar, Anivrittibaddar, Suhumasampray-Upasamaka and Kshapaka, Upashantamoha, Khinamoha, Sayogikevali, and Ayogikevali.
Discussion - The above fourteen Jeeva-sthana, as stated in the Sutra, are known as Gunasthana. Their brief description is as follows:
1. Mithyadrishti Gunasthana - From the beginningless time, the vision, interest, perception, or faith of this Jeeva has been false or opposite due to the arising of Mithyatvamohaniya karma. Although the intensity and mildness of the passions of the Jeevas in this Gunasthana vary, their vision remains false or opposite. They never have a true understanding of their own nature. And until the Jeeva has a true understanding of himself (Samyagdarshan), he will remain in Mithyadrishti. However, it has been given the name Gunasthana because the true qualities of the Jeevas in this place have not been destroyed, but they are not shining at present due to the covering of karma.
2. Sasadan or Sasvadan Samyagdristi Gunasthana - When a Bhavy Jeeva becomes Samyagdristi by subduing the Mithyatvamohaniya karma and the Anantanubandhi passions, he remains in that state for a moment. Within that time, if the Anantanubandhi passion arises while some time is left, then he falls according to the rule and enjoys the taste of the Samyaktva that was vomited for a period of six Avali-kalas. This intermediate state of falling is called Sasvadan Gunasthana, and this Jeeva has fallen by enjoying (enjoying) the Samyaktva, therefore it is also called Sasadan Samyagdristi.

## English Translation:

**42]**
[Samvayanga Sutra 3. The being, while attaining the state of perfect knowledge (Samyaktv) through the suppression (Upasham) of the first stage of the right and wrong view (Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan), divides the wrong conduct (Mithyatva Karma) into three categories: wrong conduct, right and wrong view, and perfect knowledge. If the right and wrong view nature arises immediately after the suppression of perfect knowledge, then the being becomes one with the view of being half-perfect and half-wrong. This is called the third stage of right and wrong view (Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan). Its duration is only a moment (Antarmuhurt). Therefore, if the nature of perfect knowledge arises after that, then the being ascends and becomes perfectly knowledgeable. And if the wrong conduct arises, then the being falls down and enters the stage of wrong view.

**4.**  **The stage of uninterrupted perfect view (Aviratsamyagdristi Gunasthan):**  The being becomes perfectly knowledgeable by suppressing, destroying, or partially destroying the knowledge-obscuring karma (Darshan Mohaniya Karma). The being attains the true knowledge of the self, but due to the arising of the conduct-obscuring karma (Charitra Mohaniya Karma), it becomes unable to walk on the path of truth. Even though there is a desire to follow the vows and restraints, the being is unable to even slightly follow them. Due to the lack of renunciation (Virati) or abandonment, this stage is called the stage of uninterrupted perfect view. This stage can be attained by the sentient five-sense beings (Panchendriya Paryaptak) of all four realms.

**5.** **The stage of partially renounced and unrenowned (Viratavirat Gunasthan):** When the suppression or partial destruction of the non-rejectable passions (Apratyaakhyan Kashaya) occurs in the aforementioned perfectly knowledgeable being, then it becomes renounced from the gross sins like non-violence (Trasahinsa) etc., but remains unrenowned from the subtle sins like non-violence towards stationary beings (Sthavarahinsa) etc. Such a being, who is renounced from the country (Deshavirat) and follows the minor vows (Anuvrat), is called the one who is in the stage of partially renounced and unrenowned. This stage can only be attained by the perfectly knowledgeable beings of the human and karma-realm (Karmabhumij) and some of the perfectly knowledgeable beings of the animal realm (Tiryanch).

**6.** **The stage of negligent restraint (Pramattasanyat Gunasthan):** When the suppression or partial destruction of the rejection-covering passion (Pratyaakhyanavaran Kashaya) occurs in the aforementioned perfectly knowledgeable being, then it abandons all the gross and subtle sins like non-violence etc. and adopts the great vows (Mahavrat) or complete restraint (Sakalasanyam). However, due to the intense arising of the burning passions (Sanjwalan) and the subtle passions (Nokashayas), some negligence remains. Such a restrained being with negligence is called the one who is in the stage of negligent restraint.

**7.** **The stage of non-negligent restraint (Apramattasanyat Gunasthan):** When the burning passions and subtle passions arise mildly in the aforementioned being, then it becomes free from all negligence like sensory objects, false speech, sleep etc. and follows the restraint without negligence. Such a virtuous being is called the one who is in the stage of non-negligent restraint.

- It is important to note here that all the stages from the fifth onwards are only for humans, and all the stages from the seventh onwards are for the beings who are destined for liberation (Tadbhav Mokshagami) and possess the highest endurance (Uttam Sanhanan). However, the near-liberated (Nikat Bhavya) can also ascend up to the eleventh stage. But their fall is inevitable, and they can wander in the world until the time of the half-cycle of the transformation of matter (Aparadh Pudgalparavartan Kal).

- There are two categories above the seventh stage: the suppression category (Upasham श्रेणी) and the destruction category (Kshapak श्रेणी). The being who suppresses the conduct-obscuring karma ascends the suppression category. The being who strives to destroy the conduct-obscuring karma ascends the destruction category. The duration of both categories of stages is a moment (Antarmuhurt).

---------------------------
## The Fourteen Stages of Existence (Chaturdasasthanaka-Samavaya)

**8. Nivrittibadar Gunasthan (Stage of Cessation with Variation):**  A being who has subdued the seven natures (fourfold passions and the threefold delusion of perception) reaches this eighth stage. Due to their unique purity, they prepare to subdue the remaining 21 natures of the delusion of conduct. A being who has destroyed these seven natures, a Kshayik Samyagdarshi (perfect seer), prepares for the destruction of these natures. Therefore, the results of beings in this stage vary, and the passions of the Badar (obstruction) category arise. Hence, it is called the Nivrittibadar Gunasthan.

**9. Anivrittibadar Gunasthan (Stage of Cessation without Variation):** All beings who reach this stage simultaneously have the same results; there is no variation or cessation. Therefore, it is called the Anivrittibadar Gunasthan. In this stage, a being in the Upshama (subduing) category abandons all natures except subtle greed, while a being in the Kshapaka (destroying) category destroys all of them and reaches the tenth stage.

**10. Sukshmasampray Gunasthan (Stage of Subtle Passion):** Both categories of beings who reach this stage experience the subtle passion of greed. Therefore, it is called the Sukshmasampray Gunasthan. The name Sampray refers to the passion. A being in the Upshama category subdues this subtle greed and reaches the eleventh stage, while a being in the Kshapaka category destroys it and reaches the twelfth stage. This difference between the two categories is why this stage is called "Sukshmasampray Upshama Kshapaka."

**11. Upshantamoha Gunasthan (Stage of Subdued Delusion):** A being in the Upshama category reaches this stage after subduing subtle greed at the end of the tenth stage. They have completely subdued all natures of the delusion karma, hence it is called the Upshantamoha Gunasthan. This stage lasts for a short internal moment. Upon its completion, the being falls back to the seventh stage. If their cycle of existence continues, they may even reach the Mithyatva (false belief) stage.

**12. Kshinamaha Gunasthan (Stage of Diminished Delusion):** A being in the Kshapaka category, having ascended to the tenth stage, destroys even subtle greed at its end, becoming Kshinamaha (diminished delusion) and reaching the twelfth stage. Since their delusion karma is completely diminished or destroyed, this stage is aptly named "Kshinamaha." This stage also lasts for a short internal moment. Within it, the being destroys countless times the essence of the five natures of knowledge-obscuring karma, the nine natures of perception-obscuring karma, and the five natures of obstruction karma, ultimately destroying them all and attaining omniscience and perfect perception, reaching the thirteenth stage.

**13. Sayogikevali Gunasthan (Stage of Omniscience with Attachments):** In this stage, the Kevali (omniscient) being possesses attachments. Therefore, it is called the Sayogikevali Gunasthan. These Sayogijins (omniscient beings with attachments) continue to preach and wander. When only an internal moment of life remains, they cease their attachments and enter the fourteenth stage.

[44]
The time of this Gunasthan is equal to the time of pronunciation of the five short vowels 'a, i, u, ṛ, ḷ'. Within this time, they destroy all the natures residing in the beings of Vedaniya, Ayu, Nama and Gotrakarma, become pure, Nirjan Siddhas, and reside in the Siddhalaya, becoming the enjoyers of infinite self-generated happiness.
96-The Jivas of the Bharat and Airavata regions are said to be fourteen thousand four hundred and one yojanas long, plus six parts out of nineteen parts of a yojana.
Explanation- The shape of the Bharat and Airavata regions is like a bow with a string attached. The length of the string is called the Jiva. It is said to be (144011) yojanas long in these regions.
97-Each Chaturanta Chakravarti king has fourteen jewels, such as: Striratna, Senapatiratna, Grihapatiratna, Purohitratna, Vardhakiratna, Ashvaratna, Hastiratna, Ashiratna, Dandaratna, Chakratna, Chhatratna, Charmaratna, Maniratna and Kakiniratna.
Explanation- In animate or inanimate objects, the object that is the best in its class is called a Ratna. The most beautiful woman in the time of each Chakravarti becomes his queen and is called Striratna. Similarly, the chief commander of the army is called Senapatiratna, the chief storekeeper or treasurer is called Grihapatiratna, the priest who performs peace ceremonies etc. is called Purohitratna, the carpenter who builds chariots etc. is called Vardhakiratna, the best horse is called Ashvaratna and the best elephant is called Hastiratna. These seven are animate Panchendriya Ratnas. The remaining seven are one-sense body Ratnas. It is said that one thousand gods serve each Ratna. This proves the excellence of these Ratnas.
98-In this island called Jambudvipa, fourteen great rivers flow from the east and west into the Lavanasamudra. Such as: Ganga-Sindhu, Rohita-Rohitansha, Hari-Harikanta, Sita-Sitoda, Narakanta-Narikanta, Suvarnakula-Rupyakuka, Rakta and Raktavati.
Explanation- Of the above seven pairs, the first named great river flows from the east and the second named great river flows from the west into the Lavanasamudra. Each pair of rivers flows through the Bharat etc.

[Samavayanga Sutra has described fifteen supremely unrighteous gods.
Amba 1, Ambarishi 2, Shyam 3, Shabal 4, Rudra 5, Uparudra 6, Kal 7, Mahakal 8, Asipata 9, Dhanu 10, Kumbha 11, Valuka 12, Vaitarani 13, Kharaswar 14, Mahaghosh 15 ||1-2||
Discussion- Although these Amba etc. fifteen are Asura Kumaras, residents of the Bhavan, yet due to the karmic impressions of their previous births, they are extremely cruel and cause great suffering. They derive pleasure only from making the Narakas fight, clash and kill each other, hence they are called supremely unrighteous. The one who drags the Narakas down from their place and ties them up and leaves them in the open sky (Ambar) is called Amba. Ambarishi Asura cuts the Narakas into pieces fit for cooking in a cauldron. Shyam Asura beats the Narakas with whips and strikes with his hands. Shabal Asura tears open the bodies of the Narakas and takes out their intestines, fat, heart etc. Rudra and Uparudra Asura pierce them with spears and hang them up. Kal Asura cooks the Narakas in a cauldron. Mahakal eats their cooked flesh in pieces. Asipata Asura takes the form of a Semal tree and when the Narakas come under its shade, he drops sharp leaves like the edge of a sword on them and causes them pain. Dhanu Asura pierces the limbs of the Narakas with sharp-pointed arrows shot from his bow. Kumbha cooks them in cauldrons. Valuka Asura, by changing the form of his body to the size of a grain of sand, the size of a Kadamba flower and the size of a thunderbolt, roasts the Narakas like chickpeas in hot sand in a hot cauldron. Vaitarani Asura takes the form of a hot river filled with pus, blood etc. and when the Narakas come to drink water due to thirst, he causes them pain with his caustic hot water and makes them dive in it. Kharaswar Asura repeatedly makes the Narakas climb and descend on a thorny Semal tree made of thunderbolt. Mahaghosh Asura encircles the fleeing Narakas with fences and gives them various kinds of torture. In this way, these cruel gods go up to the third earth and inflict terrible suffering on the Narakas there.

Dhuvrarahu, from the first day of the dark fortnight, covers the fifteenth part of the moon's light with fifteen parts of his own light.

[47 It keeps covering itself with its dark color. For example, on the first day, it covers the first part, on the second day, the second part, on the third day, the third part, on the fourth day, the fourth part, on the fifth day, the fifth part, on the sixth day, the sixth part, on the seventh day, the seventh part, on the eighth day, the eighth part, on the ninth day, the ninth part, on the tenth day, the tenth part, on the eleventh day, the eleventh part, on the twelfth day, the twelfth part, on the thirteenth day, the thirteenth part, on the fourteenth day, the fourteenth part, and on the fifteenth (Amavasya) day, it covers the fifteenth part. The same Dhruva Rahu shows the fifteenth-fifteenth part of the moon in the bright fortnight. For example, on the first day, it shows the fifteenth part, on the second day, it shows the second fifteenth part. In this way, on the full moon day, it shows the fifteenth part and illuminates the full moon.
Discussion - Rahu has been considered of two types - one Parva Rahu and the other Dhruva Rahu. Of these, Parva Rahu covers the lunar vehicle after six months on the full moon day, and Dhruva Rahu, moving four fingers below the lunar vehicle, covers one by one कला of the moon in the dark fortnight and illuminates one by one कला in the bright fortnight. The brilliance or light of the moon is called Chandraleshya. 104- Six constellations are said to be associated with fifteen muhurtas of the moon, such as - Shatabhishak, Bharani, Ardra, Ashlesha, Swati and Jyestha. These six constellations remain associated with the moon for fifteen muhurtas. ||1||
105- In Chaitra and Asauj months, the day is of fifteen-fifteen muhurtas. Similarly, in Chaitra and Asauj months, the night is also of fifteen-fifteen muhurtas.
106- Fifteen arthaadhikars named Vastu have been mentioned for the previous part of the Vidyaanuvaad.
107- Fifteen types of paths have been mentioned for humans, such as - Satchamanpath (1), Mosamanpath (2), Satchamosamanpath (3), Asatchamosamanpath (4), Satchavaipath (5), Mosavaipath (6), Satchamosavaipath (7), Asatchamosavaipath (8), Oraliyasarirakaypath (9), Oraliyamissarirakaypath (10), Veuvviyasarirakaypath (11), Veuvviyamissarirakaypath (12), Aharayasarirakaypath (13), Aharayamissarirakaypath (14), Kammasarirakaypath (15).

The Samvayanga Sutra mentions fifteen types of actions of humans, such as: 1. Satyamana: action, 2. Mrishyamana: action, 3. Satyamrishyamana: action, 4. Asatyamrishyamana: action, 5. Satya-vachan: action, 6. Mrishya-vachan: action, 7. Satyamrishya-vachan: action, 8. Asatyamrishya-vachan: action, 9. Audarik-sharira-kaya: action, 10. Audarik-mishra-sharira-kaya: action, 11. Vaikriya-sharira-kaya: action, 12. Vaikriya-mishra-sharira-kaya: action, 13. Aharak-sharira-kaya: action, 14. Aharak-mishra-sharira-kaya: action, and 15. Karman-sharira-kaya: action.
Discussion - The action, result, or activity of the soul is called action. Or, the action, result, or activity with which the soul is intensely connected is called action. The action of thinking about the truth is called Satyamana: action. Similarly, the action of thinking about falsehood (untruth) is called Mrishyamana: action, the action of thinking about both truth and falsehood is called Satyamrishyamana: action, and the action of thinking about neither truth nor falsehood is called Asatyamrishyamana: action. Similarly, one should understand the meaning of the four types of speech actions: truth, falsehood, etc. The action of the body of the sufficient human and animal is called Audarik-sharira-kaya: action, and the action of the body of the insufficient human and animal is called Audarik-mishra-sharira-kaya: action. Similarly, the action of the Vaikriya body of the sufficient gods and hell beings is called Vaikriya-sharira-kaya: action, and the action of the body of the insufficient gods and hell beings is called Vaikriya-mishra-sharira-kaya: action. The action of taking on the Audarik body again while being an Aharak body is called Aharak-mishra-sharira-kaya: action, and the action of the Aharak body is called Aharak-sharira-kaya: action. The action of the soul in the state of disintegration, while leaving one motion and going to another, is called Karman-sharira-kaya: action. In the state of the Kevali Bhagwan's manifestation, there is also Karman-sharira-kaya: action in the third, fourth, and fifth times.

109 - In the Mahasukha kalpa, the state of many gods is said to be fifteen Sagaropama. The gods who have the Nand, Sunand, Nandavatta, Nandaprabha, Nandakanta, Nandavarna, Nandalesa, Nandajjhaya, Nandasinga, Nandashittha, Nandakuda, and Nanduttarvadinsaga vimanas, their state is said to be fifteen Sagaropama. These gods inhale, exhale, breathe in, and breathe out for fifteen half-months. Their food is born from fifteen thousand years of residence.

Discussion-In the first Shruta-Skandha of the Sutra-Kritanga Sutra, there are sixteen studies named 'Time' etc., hence they are famous as 'Gatha-Shodashak'. The first study deals with the times (principles or doctrines) of the non-believers etc. The second study is composed in Vaitaliya verses. Hence it is called Vaitaliya. Similarly, one should know the statement of the remaining studies. In the Samovasaran study, three hundred and sixty-three doctrines have been described collectively. The sixteenth study is called Gatha because it sings the meaning of the aforementioned fifteen studies.
111-Sixteen Kasaya have been mentioned, as follows-Anantanubandhi Krodha, Anantanubandhi Mana, Anantanubandhi Maya, Anantanubandhi Lobha; Apratyakhyanakasaya Krodha, Apratyakhyanakasaya Mana, Apratyakhyanakasaya Maya, Apratyakhyanakasaya Lobha; Pratyakhyanavaran Krodha, Pratyakhyanavaran Mana, Pratyakhyanavaran Maya.

[Seventeen Types of Death - Samvay]
[53 10. Child Death, 11. False Death, 12. Perfect Death, 13. Accidental Death, 14. Vulture-Touched or Vulture-Back Death, 15. Death by Rejection of Devotees, 16. Death by Ingini, 17. Death by Approaching a Tree.
Discussion-Description is as follows
1. Aavichimaran - The wave or ripple of water is called Vichi. Just as one wave after another rises and falls in water due to the influence of air, in the same way, the Dalikas or Niṣeka of Ayukarma arise and fall or are destroyed at the time of their manifestation. The falling of the Dalikas of Ayukarma is death. Therefore, this death at the time of manifestation is called Aavichimaran. Or Vichi is also the name of separation. The death in which there is no separation or interruption is called Aavichimaran. The long vowel 'ā' is used in Prakrit in place of the short vowel 'a'.
2. Avadhimaran - Avadhi means limit or boundary. The death that occurs due to the limit is called Avadhimaran. If a being dies after experiencing the present life's lifespan and binds the same lifespan for the next life and will die after experiencing the same lifespan in the next life, then the death of such a being in the present life is called Avadhimaran. The meaning is that if a being dies after experiencing the Dalikas of lifespan and will die again after experiencing the same Dalikas, then it is called Avadhimaran.
3. Aatyantikmaran - The death of a being in the present life who will die after experiencing the Dalikas of the present lifespan of Narakadi and will not die after experiencing that lifespan in the future is called Aatyantikmaran.
4. Valanmaran - The death of beings who die in an Avrata state after being fallen or degraded from Dharma while observing restraint, vows, rules, etc. is called Valanmaran.
5. Vashartmaran - The death of beings who die under the control of the objects of the senses, i.e., suffering from them, is called Vashartmaran. For example, moths die attracted to the light of a lamp at night, in the same way, dying due to suffering from any object of the senses is called Vashartmaran.
6. Antahshalyamaran - The death of a being who dies keeping some kind of shalya in the mind is called Antahshalyamaran. For example, a restrained man, while engaged in his vows, dies keeping the shalya of guilt, pride, etc. in his mind without being criticized.
7. Tadbhavamaran - If a being dies binding the lifespan suitable for the same life in which it is experiencing the lifespan in the present life, then such death is called Tadbhavamaran. This death occurs only in human or animal beings. It does not happen to gods or hell beings, because it is a rule that gods or hell beings cannot become gods or hell beings again after death. Their birth takes place only in human or animal beings with five senses.
8. Balamaran - In the language of Agam, an Avirat or Mithyadristi being is called 'Bal'. The death of Mithyadristi and unrestrained beings is called Balamaran. The death of beings from the first Gunasthan to the fourth is called Balamaran.

**13. Vaihayasamaran -** Vaihayas refers to the sky. Death by hanging oneself from a tree or other object is called Vaihayasamaran.

**14. Griddhasprushta or Griddhaprasthamaran -** The Prakrit word "Giddhapitt" has two Sanskrit forms: Griddhasprushta and Griddhaprastha. According to the first form, the death of a being whose flesh is being eaten by vultures, eagles, or other birds is called Griddhasprushtamaran. According to the second form, the death of a being who enters the body of a dead elephant, camel, or other animal and allows their body to be eaten by vultures, etc., is called Griddhaprasthamaran.

**15. Bhaktapratyakhyanamaran -** The death of a human being who, due to an affliction, famine, incurable disease, or a frail body, abandons the three or four types of food for life and adopts Sanllekhana or Sannyasa, is called Bhaktapratyakhyanamaran. Such a person takes care of their own needs and accepts help from others if offered.

**16. Inginimaran -** The death of a Bhaktapratyakhyani who abandons the service provided by others and, as long as they have the strength, continues to rise, sit, and serve themselves in a designated place, is called Inginimaran.

## Nineteen Standpoints - Samvaya

**Nineteen Standpoints**

The nineteen standpoints are explained in the **Jnatadharmakathanga Sutra** (the first Shruta Skandha). These are: 1. Utshiptanjat, 2. Saghat, 3. Anda, 4. Kurma, 5. Shailak, 6. Tumb, 7. Rohini, 8.

**The Sun's Height**

In Jambudvipa, the sun rises and sets at a height of nineteen hundred yojanas.

**Explanation:** The sun is situated eight hundred yojanas above the earth's surface. Below the earth's surface, there is a salt ocean that is one thousand yojanas deep. Therefore, the sun's heat reaches one hundred yojanas above the earth's surface, where the celestial sphere is located, and eighteen hundred yojanas below the earth's surface, reaching the bottom of the salt ocean. This makes a total of nineteen hundred (1900) yojanas.

**Venus's Movement**

Venus, the great planet, rises in the west and sets in the west, moving along with nineteen constellations.

**Jambudvipa's Divisions**

Jambudvipa is divided into nineteen parts (Kulas).

**Explanation:** Jambudvipa is one hundred thousand yojanas wide. Within it, there are six mountain ranges and seven regions. These are twice as wide as Bharatavarsha, extending to Mount Meru. From Meru to Airavata, they are half as wide. The sum of all these (1+2+4+8+16+32+16+8+4+2+1=190) is one hundred and ninety. Dividing one hundred thousand by this (190) gives 526. After canceling out the zeros, we are left with 6/19. This is the nineteen parts mentioned in the original text. Multiplying the number of divisions in each region or mountain range by the number of yojanas in that region or mountain range gives the total width of that region or mountain range.

**The Nineteen Tirthankaras**

Nineteen Tirthankaras lived in houses before becoming monks.

**Explanation:** Vasupujya, Malli, Arishtanemi, Parshvanath, and Mahavira, these five Tirthankaras became monks while still young. The remaining nineteen Tirthankaras renounced their homes and became monks.

**The Nineteen Paliovamans**

In this world, there are nineteen Paliovamans, who are the followers of the path of liberation.

[Twenty Stands of Unsteadiness]
1. Walking, 2. Being of unpurified conduct, 3. Being of impure conduct, 4. Keeping extra bedding and seats, 5. Overcoming night-time ascetics, 6. Blaming and harming or insulting senior ascetics, 7. Unnecessarily harming the one-sensed beings, 8. Always being prone to anger, 9. Being excessively angry, 10. Speaking ill of others behind their backs, 11. Constantly and always negating the virtues of others, calling a person who is not a slave or a thief as a slave or a thief, etc., 12. Constantly creating new disputes (quarrels or conflicts), 13. Reawakening settled or pacified disputes (fights), 14. Being unclean (having hands and feet covered with conscious dust, etc., accepting alms from a person with unclean hands, and walking on unclean ground, sitting on unclean seats, etc.), 15. Studying during the wrong time and not studying during the right time, 16. Quarrelling, 17. Studying and conversing in a loud voice at night, 18. Speaking words that create division in the assembly or the community, 19. Eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset, and 20. Not following the rules of the Aeshana Samiti and consuming non-prescribed food.

Discussion: Those actions that cause distress in one's own mind or the minds of others are called Unsteadiness Stands. All the actions mentioned in the sutras cause distress and suffering to others, and also to those who perform them. For example, walking without looking or searching, and stumbling and falling, or being bitten by a snake or scorpion, causes great distress and suffering. Keeping more bedding and seats than is allowed by the ascetic code, overcoming others, insulting gurus and others, and constantly creating new quarrels and disputes, cause disturbance in the community. Being expelled from the community and suffering from illness due to eating all day also cause great suffering to oneself. Therefore, all these twenty actions are called Unsteadiness Stands.

141 - Munisuvrat Arhat was twenty Dhanus tall. All the Ghonodadhivatavalaya are said to be twenty thousand yojanas thick. The Devagana of the Devendra, the king of the Pranas, are said to be twenty thousand in number. The karma of the Napumsakavedaniya, in comparison to the new karma-bandha, is said to be twenty koda-kodi sagaropama in its [superior] state. The Pratyakhyana, the previous, is said to be twenty Vathu, meaning the number of chapters. The Utsarpini and Avasarpini Mandal (R-cycle) are said to be twenty koda-kodi sagaropama in time.
The meaning is that the Utsarpini time is ten koda-kodi sagaropama and the Avasarpini time is ten koda-kodi sagaropama, together they make up one time cycle of twenty koda-kodi sagaropama.

Similarly, the Sutras which are Chhinna Chhedanaya are called Chhinna Chhedanayik. There are twenty-two such Sutras in the Drishtivad Anga which are explained according to the practice or method of Jainism. The Nay which depends on the Chhed of the Achhinna (Abhinna) Sutra is called Achhinna Chhedanak, i.e., it depends on the second and subsequent verses. Twenty-two such Sutras are spoken according to the practice of Ajivika Goshalak's opinion. The Sutras which are spoken with the dependence of the three Nays - Dravyastik, Paryayastik and Ubayastik - are called Trikanayik or Trairasik according to the practice of their opinion. The Sutras which are spoken with the dependence of the four Nays - Sangrah, Vyavahar, Rijusutra and Shabdaditrik - are called Chatushkanayik. They are related to their own time.

162-Twenty-four Devathanas are said to be with Indra. The rest are without Indra, without Purohita and the Devas there are called Ahmindra.
Discussion- The twenty-four Devathanas which are said to be with Indra are as follows- Ten places of the ten types of Bhavanvasi Devas, eight places of the eight types of Vyantar Devas, five places of the five types of Jyotishka Devas and one place of the Kalpvasi Devas like Saudharma. Thus, all these together (10+8+5+1=24) are twenty-four. In all these places, there is a system like king, subjects etc., therefore, their rulers are called Indra. But in nine Graiveyak and five Anuttar Vimanas, there is no concept of king, subjects etc., but all the Devas there are of equal wealth and glory, they all experience themselves as 'Aham Indra:' I am Indra, therefore, they are called 'Ahmindra' and for this reason, those fourteen places are called Anindra (without Indra) and Apurohita (without Purohita). This word Apurohita is a sign, therefore, where there is Indra, there are also Samanik, Trayastrinash, Atmarakshak, Purohita and Lokpal etc. But where there is no concept of Indra, those Devathanas are called by words like 'Anindra, Apurohita' etc.

Shrotrendriya-ragopaarti, 2. Chakshurindriya-ragopaarti, 3. Ghranendriya-ragopaarti, 4. Jihvendriya-ragopaarti and 5. Sparshanendriya-ragopaarti.
In the reign of the twenty-two Tirthankaras in the middle of the cycle, Chaturyaam Dharma was prevalent in place of the Panchmahavrat, therefore, the first and the last Tirthankaras are taken here. The first Tirthankara Bhagwan Rishabhdev and the last Tirthankara Vardhaman Swami, who preached the Panchyaam Vrats and for their protection, also laid down the law of contemplation, meditation and practice of five reflections of each Vrat. The Mahavrat of Ahimsa, accepted for life, can only be protected when walking on the ground, keeping an eye on the living beings, keeping control over the fickleness of the mind, speaking words of benefit, moderation, and love, while keeping control while speaking, eating and drinking after seeing and searching properly in a place illuminated by the sun, and taking care while picking up and keeping clothes, utensils, etc. These are the five reflections of the first Mahavrat.
To protect the Mahavrat of Satya, it is necessary to speak after thinking carefully, to give up anger, to give up greed, to give up fear, and to give up laughter and ridicule. Speaking without thinking can lead to false words coming out of the mouth, false words often come out of the mouth in the heat of anger, people often lie out of greed, a person also speaks falsely out of fear, and even in laughter, it is often seen that people speak falsely to humiliate or make fun of others. Therefore, to fully protect the Mahavrat of Satya, it is necessary to abandon Anuveechibhashan and anger, greed, fear, and laughter.
To protect the Mahavrat of Achaurya, it is necessary to obtain permission or consent from the owner of any object before accepting it, to accept the object only after knowing one's own limits or boundaries, to accept the object by begging oneself, to invite one's own Sadharmiks for food and water and then eat and drink, and to offer the food and drink brought by begging to the Gurus and eat after obtaining their permission. The Sanskrit commentator, while explaining Parijanata, has also given the meaning of residence, which means that the residence should be made only after obtaining permission from the owner of the place, the Sthanak or the Upashraya, etc.

Page #191:

[72]
To protect the **Brahmacharya** (celibacy) **mahavrat** (great vow), one should avoid sleeping or sitting in places frequented by women, animals, eunuchs, and immoral people. One should avoid listening to stories that arouse desire in women and looking at their attractive features. One should not recall past sexual experiences and pleasures. One should also avoid rich, nourishing, and flavorful food and drink.

To protect the **Parigraha-tyaga** (non-attachment) **mahavrat**, it is essential to renounce attachment to the objects of the five senses and aversion to undesirable objects. Only by cultivating these attitudes can the aforementioned **mahavrats** be stable and firm. Therefore, one should constantly contemplate these attitudes.

The **Tattvartha Sutra** also mentions 25 attitudes for these vows, but there are some differences in the attitudes for the third **Achaurya** (non-stealing) **mahavrat** in the **Shwet.** and **Di.** versions. Due to their relevance to the topic and their importance, they are mentioned here:

According to the **Shwet. Tattvadhigam Bhashya**:

1. **Nirdosha Avgraha** - Accepting and requesting what is free from faults like **avgraha** (taking), **yachana** (requesting), **himsa** (violence), etc.
2. **Abhikshanavgrahayachana** - Continuously accepting and requesting in the same way.
3. **Etavadityavgrahavadharana** - Accepting only as much as is necessary, saying, "This is enough for me."
4. **Samaandharmikebhya Avgrahayachana** - Requesting from and accepting things from those who are of the same faith.
5. **Anujnapita Pan-Bhojan** - Eating and drinking only with permission.

According to the **Di. Tattvartha Sutra**:

1. **Shunyagar-Avasa** - Residing in empty houses, monasteries, etc., that have no owner and are declared open for everyone.
2. **Vimochita Avasa** - Residing in houses whose owners have been expelled by the king or others and declared open for everyone.
3. **Paroparodhakarana** - Not refusing to accommodate a fellow practitioner if they come to stay at the same place.
4. **Bhaikhya Shuddhi** - Accepting alms after avoiding all faults and obstacles related to begging.
5. **Sadharmavinsavad** - Avoiding discord or conflict with fellow practitioners.

The twenty-five *uttaraprakrti* of the *nāma* karma, which is *saṅklīṣṭa-pariṇāma* and *aparyāpta* *mithyādṛṣṭi* *vikaleṇdriya* (two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed) *jīva*, are bound, such as: 1. *Tiryaggatināma*, 2. *Vikaleṇdriya-jātīnāma*, 3. *Audārika-śarīranāma*, 4. *Taijasa-śarīranāma*, 5. *Karmmaṇa-śarīranāma*, 6. *Huṇḍaka-saṁsthānānāma*, 7. *Audārika-śarīrāṅgopaṅgānāma*, 8. *Sevārtasaṁhanānāma*, 9. *Varṇanāma*, 10. *Gandhanāma*, 11. *Rasānāma*, 12. *Sparśanāma*,

Discussion- Mithyadristi, which is filled with extreme karmic consequences, binds the aforementioned 25 types of karma to the Vikalendriya Jiva. It is important to note here that Vikalendriya Jivas are of three types, based on the number of senses they possess: Dvi-indriya, Tri-indriya, and Chatur-indriya. Therefore, when a Jiva binds the aforementioned types of karma suitable for a Dvi-indriya-Apariaptka, it will bind Dvi-indriya jati karma instead of Vikalendriya jati karma. Similarly, a Jiva binding karma suitable for a Tri-indriya or Chatur-indriya jati will bind Tri-indriya or Chatur-indriya jati karma. This is because there is no Vikalendriya jati category within the 5 types of jati karma. The term 'Vikalendriya' is used in this Sutra due to the requirement of mentioning 25 types of karma each, and to avoid the repetition of mentioning these types three times for each of the three types of Vikalendriya.
170- Ganga-Sindhu and the other great rivers fall into 25 kosha wide, thick, pot-shaped mouths, and then flow out through a channel resembling the tongue of a crocodile's mouth, forming a pearl necklace-like waterfall. Similarly, the Rakta-Raktavati great rivers also fall into 25 kosha wide, thick, pot-shaped mouths, and then flow out through a channel resembling the tongue of a crocodile's mouth, forming a pearl necklace-like waterfall.
Discussion- The Ganga Mahadhi flows out from the eastern entrance of the Padma-draha, located on top of the small Himvant Kulachal or Varshadhar Parvat, and the Sindhu Mahadhi flows out from the western entrance. Similarly, the Rakta Mahadhi flows out from the eastern entrance of the Pandarika-draha, located on top of the Shikhari Kulachal, and the Raktavati Mahadhi flows out from the western entrance. All four of these great rivers flow for 500 yojanas on top of the mountains before flowing down. After that, the Ganga-Sindhu flow south towards the Bharat Kshetra, and the Rakta-Raktavati flow north towards the Airvat Kshetra, and fall into their respective waterfalls, such as the Ganga-kut, located on the ground. At the point where they fall from the mountain, there is a large, vajra-made channel for them to flow through. The mouth of this channel is round, like the mouth of a pot, facing the mountain, and long and tongue-like, like the tongue of a crocodile, facing the Bharat and other Kshetras. The water flowing down from the mountain appears like a necklace of thousands of pearls. This water flow is 25 kosha, or 1.25 yojanas, wide.

Rati, bhaya, shoka, jugupsa.

[Samavayanga Sutra]
The twenty-six karma-ansh (natures) of karma, which are mohaniya (delusive) for the abhavya (non-liberated) beings, are mentioned in the text as follows: 1. Mithyatva mohaniya, 17. Sixteen kshaya, 18. Strived, 19. Purushaved, 20. Napunsakaved, 21. Hasya, 22. Arati, 23. Rati, 24. Bhaya, 25. Shoka, and 26. Jugupsa.

**Discussion:** When a being first mitigates darshan moha (delusion of perception) and attains samyag darshan (right perception), they then divide the darshan mohaniya karma into three parts, which have been ongoing since time immemorial. At that point, they possess twenty-eight natures, including the aforementioned twenty-five divisions of charitra moha (delusion of conduct). However, abhavya beings never attain samyag darshan, and therefore they are unable to divide the three parts of anadi mithyatva (innate false belief). As a result, they always have twenty-six natures of mohaniya karma. The natures of misra (mixed) and samyaktva mohaniya (delusion of right conduct) do not exist in them.

176 - In this Ratnaprabha earth, the state of how many narakas (hells) is said to be twenty-six palyopama (comparisons). In the Adhastana seventh Mahatamah Prabha earth, the state of how many narakas is said to be twenty-six sagaropama (comparisons). The state of how many Asura Kumaras (demigods) is said to be twenty-six palyopama. In the Saudharma - Ishana kalpa, the state of how many devas (gods) is said to be twenty-six palyopama.

177 - The state of the jghannya (inferior) of the Madhyama-Madhyama Graiveyak devas is said to be twenty-six sagaropama. The state of the utkrisht (superior) of the devas who are born in the Madhyama-Adhastana Graiveyak vimanas (planes) is said to be twenty-six sagaropama. These devas take in breath or exhale after twenty-six ardhamasa (thirteen months). The desire for food arises for them after twenty-six thousand years.

There are many bhavasiddhik jivas (beings who will attain liberation) who will become siddhas (liberated), buddhas (enlightened), free from karma, attain parinirvana (final liberation), and end all suffering after twenty-six bhava (births).

## The Twenty-Seven Qualities of the Ascetic

[77
Twenty-Seven Qualities - Samvaya
179 - The twenty-seven qualities of the Ascetic are as follows: 1. Non-violence (Prāṇātipāta - Viramaṇa), 2. Truthfulness (Mṛṣāvāda - Viramaṇa), 3. Non-stealing (Adattādāna - Viramaṇa), 4. Celibacy (Maithuna - Viramaṇa), 5. Non-possession (Parigraha - Viramaṇa), 6. Restraint of the Ear (Śrotrendriya - Nigraha), 7. Restraint of the Eye (Cakṣurindriya - Nigraha), 8. Restraint of the Nose (Ghrāṇendriya - Nigraha), 9. Restraint of the Tongue (Jihvendriya - Nigraha), 10. Restraint of the Touch (Sparśendriya - Nigraha), 11. Discernment of Anger (Krodhaviveka), 12. Discernment of Pride (Mānaviveka), 13. Discernment of Deceit (Māyāviveka), 14. Discernment of Greed (Lobhaviveka), 15. Truth of Feeling (Bhāvasatya), 16. Truth of Action (Karaṇasatya), 17. Truth of Conduct (Yogasatya), 18. Forgiveness (Kṣamā), 19. Detachment (Virāgatā), 20. Concentration of Mind (Manassamāharaṇatā), 21. Concentration of Speech (Vacaṇasamāharaṇatā), 22. Concentration of Body (Kāyasamāharaṇatā), 23. Knowledge (Jñānasampannatā), 24. Vision (Darśanasampannatā), 25. Conduct (Carittasampannatā), 26. Endurance of Pain (Vedana Atiśahana), 27. Endurance of Death (Māraṇāntika Atiśahana).

Explanation - The five great vows (Mahavratas) of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession are the fundamental qualities of the Ascetic. The remaining twenty-two are the secondary qualities. These include the restraint of the five senses, meaning controlling their unruly tendencies, and the discernment of the four passions (anger, pride, deceit, and greed), meaning their abandonment. The purification of the inner self is called the truth of feeling (Bhāvasatya). The complete and careful transcription of things like clothes is called the truth of action (Karaṇasatya). Keeping the mind, speech, and body in proper conduct, meaning the purity of the three yogas, is called the truth of conduct (Yogasatya). Not harboring anger in the mind, not allowing hatred and pride to arise is the quality of forgiveness (Kṣamā). Not being attached to any object is the quality of detachment (Virāgatā). Opposing the evil tendencies of the mind, speech, and body is called their concentration. Being endowed with right vision, knowledge, and conduct is essential for the Ascetic. Enduring pain like cold, heat, etc. is called endurance of pain (Vedana Atiśahana). Enduring all kinds of trials and tribulations at the time of death, and even while enduring the mortal suffering inflicted by someone, maintaining the mind of a benevolent friend is called endurance of death (Māraṇāntika Atiśahana).

It is important to note that in the Digambara tradition, there are 28 qualities of the Ascetic. The five great vows and the restraint of the five senses, totaling ten qualities, are the same as mentioned above. The remaining eighteen qualities are: observance of the five assemblies, observance of the three secrets, performing the six essentials (Samayika Vandana, etc.), remaining naked (Acela), eating once a day, shaving the head (Keśaluñca), and abandoning bathing, brushing teeth, etc.

The fundamental difference between the two is only in remaining naked (Acela). The other qualities are essentially included within each other.

In the Jambudvipa, the month and other things are governed by the constellations except for the Abhijit constellation. (The Abhijit constellation enters the fourth quarter of the Uttaraashada constellation.) The constellation month is said to be dominated by twenty-seven days and nights. That is, there are 27 days in a constellation month. In the Saudharma-Ishan kalpas, the earth of their vimanas is said to be twenty-seven hundred (2700) yojanas thick.
[180]
It is said that there are twenty-seven types of mohaniya karma for the beings who are free from the bondage of vedak samyaktva. On the seventh day of the bright half of Shraavana, the sun casts a shadow of twenty-seven angulas and moves towards the divasakshetra (sky illuminated by the sun) while the rajanikhetra (darkness increasing) moves in the opposite direction.

In this ratnaprabha earth, the state of many narakas is said to be twenty-seven palyopama. In the adhastana saptama mahatamahprabha earth, the state of many narakas is said to be twenty-seven sagaropama. The state of many asurakumara devas is said to be twenty-seven palyopama. In the Saudharma-Ishan kalpas, the state of many devas is said to be twenty-seven palyopama.
[182]
The lowest state of the madhyama-uvarim graiveyak devas is said to be twenty-seven sagaropama. The devas who are born in the madhyama graiveyak vimanas, their highest state is said to be twenty-seven sagaropama. These devas take breath (aan-praan) after twenty-seven half-months (thirteen and a half months). They experience the desire for food after twenty-seven thousand years.
. There are many bhavya-siddhika beings who will become siddhas, buddhas, liberated from karma, attain nirvana, and end all suffering after taking twenty-seven births.

Twenty-eighth Stānaka - Samvāya
183 - The Ācāra-prakalpa has been stated as twenty-eight types, such as - 1 Māsika Āropaṇa, 2 Sapamcaraī Māsika Āropaṇa, 3 Sadasarai Māsika Āropaṇa, [ 4 Sapamcara-sarai Māsika Āropaṇa, 5 Savīsaīrai Māsika Āropaṇa, 6 Sapamca-vīsa-sarai Māsika Āropaṇa ] and so on, 6 Dvimāsika Āropaṇa, 6 Tri-māsika Āropaṇa, 6 Catur-māsika Āropaṇa, 6 Upghātika Āropaṇa, 25 Anupghātika Āropaṇa, 26 Kṛtsnā Āropaṇa, 27 Akṛtsnā Āropaṇa, 28. These twenty-eight types are the Ācāra-prakalpa. This is to be practiced (until the purification of the committed offense).
**Explanation** - 'Ācāra' is the first part of the name. Its specific study is called prakalpa. Its other name is 'Niśītha'. It prescribes penance for the purification of offenses committed by monks and nuns due to ignorance, carelessness or passion. The reason for calling it Ācāra-prakalpa is that by performing penance, monks and nuns are re-established in their knowledge, vision and character-based conduct. Twenty-eight types of this Ācāra-prakalpa or penance are mentioned in the original text, their description is as follows:
If a monk commits an offense, he is given penance of fasting for a certain number of days for his purification. If, before the completion of that penance, he commits a greater offense, the purification of which is possible by fasting for a month, then he is given a penance of fasting for a month, which is added to the previous penance. This is called Māsika Āropaṇa. || 1 ||
If someone commits an offense, the purification of which is possible by fasting for a month along with five days and nights, then such an offender is given a penance of fasting for a month along with five days and nights, which is added to the previous penance. This is called Sapamcaraī Māsika Āropaṇa. || 1 ||
Similarly, if a greater offense is committed, the penance for which is purification by fasting for a month along with ten days and nights, then giving such penance is called Sadasarai Māsika Āropaṇa. || 3 || Similarly, if a penance of fasting for a month along with fifteen, twenty and twenty-five days and nights is added to the monthly penance, then it is called...

## Twenty-Eight Standpoints - Samvaya

[81]
1.  Eye-sense-Arthaavgraha, 3. Nose-sense-Arthaavgraha, 4. Tongue-sense-Arthaavgraha, 5. Touch-sense-Arthaavgraha, 6. No-sense-Arthaavgraha, 7. Ear-sense-Vyanjanavgraha, 8. Nose-sense-Vyanjanavgraha, 9. Tongue-sense-Vyanjanavgraha, 10. Touch-sense-Vyanjanavgraha, 11. Ear-sense-Iha, 12. Eye-sense-Iha, 13. Nose-sense-Iha, 14. Tongue-sense-Iha, 15. Touch-sense-Iha, 16. No-sense-Iha, 17. Ear-sense-Avaya, 18. Eye-sense-Avaya, 19. Nose-sense-Avaya, 20. Tongue-sense-Avaya, 21. Touch-sense-Avaya, 22. No-sense-Avaya, 23. Ear-sense-Dharana, 24. Eye-sense-Dharana, 25. Nose-sense-Dharana, 26. Tongue-sense-Dharana, 27. Touch-sense-Dharana, and 28. No-sense-Dharana.

**Discussion:** Before knowing any object, there is an indistinct perception of "something is there", this is called Darshan. Immediately after that, there is a clear but unmanifest perception, this is called Vyanjanavgraha. After that, there is a general understanding or knowledge like "this is a human being", this is called Arthaavgraha. Subsequently, there is a desire to know whether this human being is Bengali or Madrasi? This curiosity is called Iha. Again, by hearing his speech etc., it is ascertained that he is not Bengali but Madrasi, this kind of conclusive knowledge is called Avaya. When this knowledge becomes firm, it is called Dharana. In due course, it becomes the cause of remembrance. Remembrance itself is also a part of Dharana.

Vyanjanavgraha does not occur through the mind and the eye-sense because the object seen or thought about by them is manifest, but Vyanjanavgraha knowledge is unmanifest or indistinct. The four knowledges of Arthaavgraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana occur through the five senses and the sixth mind. Therefore, multiplying four by six (4 x 6 = 24), twenty-four distinctions are related to Arthaavgraha. And Vyanjanavgraha occurs through the remaining four senses except the mind and the eye, therefore, adding four distinctions to the above twenty-four distinctions (24 + 4 = 28), there are twenty-eight distinctions of Abhinibodhik knowledge. This is called Matijnana. The mind is called "No-sense" because it is not visible outside. But everyone knows its existence through thinking and contemplation.

186 - In the Isana Kalpa, twenty-eight lakh Vimanasavas have been mentioned.

187 - When a Jiva is bound in the Devagati, it binds twenty-eight Uttarapragatis of the Nama Karma, they are as follows - 1. Devagatinam, 2. Panchendriyajatinam, 3. Vaikriyasarinam, 4. Taijasarinam, 5. Karmanasharinam, 6.

The twenty-eight categories of *karma* bind the soul: [1] *Samavāyāṅgasūtra* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's physical form), [2] *Samacaturasrasanstḥānanama* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's shape), [3] *Vaikriyakaśarīrāṅgopāṅganāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's organs and limbs), [4] *Varṇanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's color), [5] *Gandhanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's smell), [6] *Rasānāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's taste), [7] *Sparśanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's touch), [8] *Devānupūrvīnāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's previous births as a deity), [9] *Agurulaghunāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's weight), [10] *Upghātanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's internal injuries), [11] *Parāghātanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's external injuries), [12] *Ucchvāsanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's breathing), [13] *Praśasta Vihāyogatināma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's good rebirth), [14] *Trasanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's trembling), [15] *Bādarānāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's foolishness), [16] *Paryāptanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's sufficiency), [17] *Pratiyekaśarīranāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's individual body), [18] *Sthita-Asthiranāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's stability or instability), [19] *Śubha-Aśubhanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's auspiciousness or inauspiciousness), [20] *Ādeya-Anādeyanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's ability to receive or not receive), [21] *Subhaganāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's beauty), [22] *Susvaranāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's good voice), [23] *Yaśaskīrtināma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's fame), and [24] *Nirmāṇanāma* (the name of the category of *karma* that determines the soul's creation).

188 - Similarly, the soul bound to hell also binds the twenty-eight categories of *karma*, but instead of binding the auspicious categories, it binds the inauspicious categories. For example, it binds the categories of *karma* that determine the soul's inauspicious rebirth, ugly form, instability, misfortune, inauspiciousness, bad voice, inability to receive, infamy, and creation. This is the only difference.

187 - In the Ratnaprabhā earth, the condition of many hell-bound beings is described as twenty-eight *palyopamas* (comparisons). In the seventh earth below, the condition of many hell-bound beings is described as twenty-eight *sāgaropamas* (comparisons). The condition of many Asura-Kumaras is described as twenty-eight *palyopamas* (comparisons). In the Saudharma and Iśāna kalpas, the condition of many deities is described as twenty-eight *palyopamas* (comparisons).

190 - The condition of the deities who reside in the lower and upper *graiveyaka* vimānas is described as twenty-eight *sāgaropamas* (comparisons). The condition of the deities who are born in the middle and upper *graiveyaka* vimānas is described as twenty-eight *sāgaropamas* (comparisons). These deities breathe, eat, and sleep every twenty-eight half-months (fourteen months). They experience the desire for food every twenty-eight thousand years.

Many *bhavya-siddhika* souls will become *siddhas*, *buddhas*, liberated from *karma*, attain *parinirvāṇa*, and end all suffering after experiencing twenty-eight births.

## Thirty-Nine Standpoints of Samvaya

The thirty-nine standpoints of Samvaya are explained in detail in the 191st chapter of the Aguna-Tisa-Vihe. These standpoints are:

1. **Bhoom-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of earth-related phenomena like earthquakes.
2. **Utpaat-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of celestial events like meteor showers.
3. **Swapna-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of dreams.
4. **Antar-Likkh-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of celestial events like eclipses and planetary conjunctions.
5. **Ang-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of physical characteristics and bodily sensations.
6. **Swar-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of sounds heard from humans, animals, and inanimate objects.
7. **Vajan-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of physical marks and blemishes on the body.
8. **Lakkhan-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the consequences of birthmarks and other physical signs.

**Bhoom-Shruta** is further divided into three categories:

1. **Sutra:** This refers to the concise and precise formulation of the principles of Bhoom-Shruta.
2. **Vritti:** This refers to the detailed explanation of the Sutras.
3. **Vaartik:** This refers to the further elaboration and commentary on the Vritti.

Similarly, the other seven types of Shruta are also divided into these three categories, resulting in a total of 24 (8 x 3) categories.

**Ang-Shruta** is also divided into three categories:

1. **Sutra:** This refers to the concise and precise formulation of the principles of Ang-Shruta.
2. **Vritti:** This refers to the detailed explanation of the Sutras.
3. **Vaartik:** This refers to the further elaboration and commentary on the Vritti.

The remaining standpoints of Samvaya are:

25. **Vikhaan-Ujog-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the principles of various arts and sciences like cooking, economics, and love.
26. **Vidyaan-Ujog-Shruta:** This refers to the scriptures that explain the principles of various knowledge systems like astrology, logic, and martial arts.

These thirty-nine standpoints of Samvaya provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the principles of Jain philosophy and practice.

## Samvayanga Sutra 27: Mantra-anuyoga-shruta - A treatise on mantra-shastra, which describes the means of various mantras that are effective for worldly purposes.

## Samvayanga Sutra 28: Yoga-anuyoga-shruta - A treatise that describes the use of collyrium, pills, etc., to subdue women, men, and others.

## Samvayanga Sutra 29: Anyatirthika-pravritta-anuyoga - Treatises composed by followers of other religions like Kapila, Buddha, etc.

Reading and listening to such scriptures attracts the mind of humans towards sensory objects.  And, reading and listening to scriptures that predict the future, dreams, etc., can lead a seeker astray from their spiritual practice. Therefore, all such scriptures are considered **papasruta** (sinful scriptures) for those seeking liberation.

## Samvayanga Sutra 192: The month of Ashadha is said to have 29 nights and days, considering the calculation of night and day. [Similarly] the months of Bhadrapada, Kartik, Pausha, Phalguna, and Vaisakha are also said to have 29 nights and days each. The lunar day is said to have 29 muhurtas, considering the calculation of muhurtas.

## Samvayanga Sutra 193: A **samyagdristi** (rightly-seeing) **bhavya** (destined for liberation) being, with **prashasta adhyavasana** (excellent outcome), is born as a deva (god) in the **vaimanika** (celestial) realm, having bound 29 **uttarapgadi** (types of name-karma) along with the name of the Tirthankara, according to the rules.

## Samvayanga Sutra 194: In this **ratna-prabha** (jewel-shining) earth, the state of many narakas (hells) is said to be **29 palyopama** (comparisons to a palya). In the seventh earth below, the state of many narakas is said to be **29 sagaropama** (comparisons to an ocean). The state of many **asura-kumara** (demi-gods) is said to be **29 palyopama**. In the **soudharma-ishana** kalpas (epochs), the state of many devas is said to be **29 palyopama**.

## Samvayanga Sutra 195: The state of devas in the **uvarima-majjhima-gevejaya** (upper-middle-victorious) realms is said to be **29 sagaropama**. The devas who are born as devas in the **uvarima-hetthima-gevejaya-vaimana** (upper-lower-victorious-celestial) realms, their state is said to be **29 sagaropama** due to their **ukkose** (elevation). These devas live for **29 half-months**, and they breathe in, breathe out, eat, and drink. They experience **29 thousand years** of **aahara-ratti** (food-time).

**Santegaiya bhavasiiddhiya** (those who have attained the state of being) beings, who are **29 bhavaga-ghana** (bound by 29 types of karma), will be **sijjhisanti** (purified), **bujjhisanti** (understand), and **mucchisanti** (liberated).

[85 They will attain Nirvana, they will end all suffering.
The inferior state of the gods of the upper, middle, and lower Graiveyak is said to be like twenty-nine oceans. The gods who are born in the form of gods in the upper, lower, and middle Graiveyak planes, their superior state is said to be like twenty-nine oceans. These gods breathe in and out or exhale and inhale after twenty-nine half-months (fourteen and a half months). After twenty-nine thousand years, these gods develop a desire for food.
How many glorious Siddhik Jivas are there who will attain Siddhi, become Buddhas, be free from karma, attain ultimate Nirvana, and end all suffering?

[Samvayanga Sutra]

Pay attention to the respect of Vinaya. If one fails in this duty, they cultivate Ashatana and break their means of liberation. Keeping this in mind, these thirty-three Ashatanas are mentioned. The original Sutra instructs on four Ashatanas and the rest are indicated by the word "Yavat". Their nature is described according to Dasashruta.

216 - In the city of Chamarachancha, the capital of the Asura king Chamaras, there are thirty-three Bhoumas (specific locations with the size of a city) outside each gate. The Mahavideha region (area) is said to be thirty-three thousand yojanas in extent. When the sun, moving inwards from the outermost circle, reaches the third circle, it becomes visible to a human being in this Bharat region from a distance of slightly less than thirty-three thousand yojanas.

217 - The state of many Narakas on this Ratnapraba earth is said to be thirty-three Palyopamas. The state of Narakas in the seven lower earths, namely Kal, Mahakal, Rouruk, and Maharouruk, is said to be thirty-three Sagaropama. The state of Narakas in the Apratishthan Naraka of the same seventh earth is said to be thirty-three Sagaropama, devoid of any distinction between the inferior and superior. The state of many Asura Kumaras and Devas is said to be thirty-three Palyopamas. The state of many Devas in the Saudharma and Ishana kalpas is said to be thirty-three Palyopamas.

218 - The state of Devas in the four Uttara Vimanas, namely Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparajita, is said to be thirty-three Sagaropama. The state of those Devas who are endowed with the divine qualities in the Mahavimanas, which are completely perfect, is said to be thirty-three Sagaropama, devoid of any distinction between the inferior and superior. These Devas eat, drink, breathe in, and breathe out every thirty-three half-months. Their food and drink arises every thirty-three thousand years.

Those beings who are destined for liberation, who are born in the thirty-three Bhavagahanas, will be born, will understand, will be liberated, will attain Nirvana, and will end all suffering.

**Samvayanga Sutra, Dvishastinathanaka-Samvay 317:** In a five-year cycle (Panchasamvatsarik Yuga), there are said to be sixty-two full moons (Purnima) and sixty-two new moons (Amavasya).

**Explanation:** According to the lunar calendar, a five-year period is called a Yuga. In this Yuga, there are two extra months. Therefore, there are two extra full moons and new moons. Keeping this in mind, there are said to be sixty-two full moons and sixty-two new moons in a Yuga.

**318:** Vasupujya Arhan is said to have sixty-two disciples (Gan) and sixty-two disciple leaders (Ganadhar).

**319:** In the waxing moon (Shukla Paksha), the moon increases by one-sixty-second part every day. In the waning moon (Krishna Paksha), it decreases by the same amount every day.

**320:** In the Saudharma and Ishana Kalpas, in the first Pratishta (stage) of the first Avali (category), there are said to be sixty-two Vimanas (celestial vehicles) in each direction. All the Vimanas in the Pratishta are said to be sixty-two in number.

**|| Dvishastinathanaka Samvay Sampt ||**

**Trishastinathanaka-Samvay 321:** The Arhan Rishabha, a Koushalika, lived for sixty-two lakh years in the palace of the king (Maharaja) before renouncing his worldly life (Agara) and becoming an ascetic (Anugariya).

**322:** In the Harivarsha and Ramyakvarsha, humans reach full maturity (Sampattajovvana) in sixty-two days and nights. They no longer need to be cared for by their parents.

[Sixty-four Stana-Samavaya]
[123 Discussion-When the Sun is in Uttarayan, it rises sixty-three times over the Nishdha mountain and there is day in the Bharat region. Again, when it is in Dakshinayan, it rises over the Vedika of Jambudvipa. After that, it rises over the Lavanasamudra. In this way, while revolving, when it rises over the Neelavant mountain, there is day in the Airvat region. There also, it rises sixty-three times over the Neelavant mountain, then rises over the Vedika of Jambudvipa and finally rises over the Lavanasamudra. Since one Sun completes one revolution of Meru in two days, therefore, it rises sixty-three times from the Nishdha mountain and illuminates the Bharat region and in the same way, it rises sixty-three times from the Neelavant mountain and illuminates the Airvat region.
||Trishatistana Samavaya Sampt||
Sixty-four Stana-Samavaya 324- The Ashtaashtamika Bhikshu-Pratima is worshipped in sixty-four nights and days, with two hundred and eighty-eight Bhikshas, according to the sutra, as it should be, with the body, by touching, protecting, purifying, crossing, reciting, following the command, and worshipping.
Discussion- The particular Abhigraha whose worship takes eight days of eight days, is called Ashtaashtamika Bhikshu-Pratima. While worshipping it, one Bhiksha is taken in the first eight days. Again, two Bhikshas are taken in the next eight days. In this way, one Bhiksha is increased in every eight days, and in the last eight days, eight Bhikshas are taken every day. In this way, in sixty-four days, all the Bhikshas become two hundred and eighty-eight (8+16+24+32+40+48+56+64=288).
325- Sixty-four lakh abodes (buildings) of Asura Kumaras are said to be there. Sixty-four thousand Samanik Devas of Chamarrasana are said to be there.
326- All the Dadhimukha mountains are situated in the shape of a drum (Dhol), with equal width from bottom to top, and are sixty-four thousand yojanas high.
327- Sixty-four thousand abodes of Vimanas are said to be there in the Sohammisana, in the Brahma-loka, and in the Yati-Sukappa.

[124]
[Samavayanga Sutra - In the Saudharma, Ishana and Brahmakalpa, there are sixty-four (32+28+4=64) lakh Vimanas.
328- All the Chaturanta Chakravarti kings are said to have a necklace of sixty-four strings of precious pearls.
|| Chatuhshashtisthanaka Samavay Sampt ||
Panchashatisthanaka-Samavay 329 - In the Jambudvipa, there are sixty-five Suryamandala (paths of the sun's revolution).
330 - The elder Mauryaputra lived in an abode for sixty-five years, then became a monk after shaving his head and leaving the abode.
331 - In the Saudharmavatansaka Vimana, there are sixty-five mansions in each direction.
|| Panchashatisthanaka Samavay Sampt ||
Shatpashtisthanaka-Samavay 332 - Sixty-six moons illuminated the southern hemisphere, illuminate it and will illuminate it. Similarly, sixty-six suns shone, shine and will shine. Sixty-six moons illuminated the northern hemisphere, illuminate it and will illuminate it. Similarly, sixty-six suns shone, shine and will shine.
Discussion - There are two moons and two suns in Jambudvipa, four moons and four suns in the Lavanasamudra, twelve moons and twelve suns in the Dhataki Khand, forty-two moons and forty-two suns in the Kalodadhi Samudra, and seventy-two moons and seventy-two suns in the Pushkarardha. The two seas and half of the Pushkarardha are called two and a half islands.

Page #244:
---------------------------
[The Sapta-shat-sthanak Samvaya]
[125] It is known that in the exact middle of the Pushkaravardvipa, there is a circular, superhuman mountain, which divides the island into two parts. The area up to the inner part of this island is called the Manushya-kshetra, because the origin of humans is up to this point. In this Pushkaravardvipa-ardha, there are two parts due to the presence of one Ishukara mountain each in the east and west directions. Of these, the southern part is called the Dakshinardha Manushya-kshetra and the northern part is called the Uttarardha Manushya-kshetra. Since within the Manushya-kshetra, according to the calculation mentioned above (2+4+12+42+72-132), there are a total of one hundred and thirty-two Chandras and Suryas. Half of them, sixty-six Chandras and Suryas, illuminate the Dakshinardha Manushya-kshetra, and sixty-six Chandras and Suryas illuminate the Uttarardha Manushya-kshetra. When the Chandras and Suryas of the northern row move towards the east during their rotation, the Chandras and Suryas of the southern row start rotating towards the west. In this way, sixty-six Chandras and Suryas illuminate their respective areas while rotating in the southern Pushkarardha and sixty-six Chandras and Suryas in the northern Pushkarardha. This arrangement is eternal, therefore, they have been illuminating in the past, are illuminating in the present, and will continue to illuminate in the future.
333-The number of Ganadharas of the Arhat is sixty-six. The number of Ganadharas of the Shreyans Arhat was sixty-six.
334-The excellent state of Abhinibodhik (mati) knowledge is said to be like sixty-six oceans. (Which is attained by going to the Achyut heaven three times or to the Vijayadi Anuttar Vimanas twice.)

Sapta-shat-sthanak Samvaya 335-Sixty-seven Nakshatra-masas are said to be in the Pancha-samvatsarik Yuga, counted by the Nakshatra-masas.
336-The sides of the Hemavat and Eravata regions are said to be sixty-six, sixty-six hundred, fifty-five Yojanas, and three parts of a Yojan in length.
337-The distance between the easternmost point of the Mandar mountain and the easternmost point of the Gautam island is said to be sixty-six thousand Yojanas without any obstruction.

[Samvayanga Sutra]
**Discussion:** The western part of Jambudvipa is 55,000 yojanas away from the eastern part of Mount Meru. From there, Gautamdvipa is located 12,000 yojanas westwards within the Lavanasamudra. Therefore, the eastern part of Gautamdvipa is located (55 + 12 = 68) 68,000 yojanas away from the eastern part of Meru, thus proving the said distance.
**338:** All the constellations are said to be equal in terms of their **sima-vikkhambha** [the area that can be covered by the moon in a day and night] when divided into 68 parts.

**339:** In the Dhaataki-khand dvipa, 68 **chakravattis** are said to have 68 **vijayas** (regions) and 68 capitals. In terms of **ukkosapada**, 68 **arhanta** have been born, are being born, and will be born. Similarly, **chakravatti**, **baladeva**, and **vasudeva** should also be known.
**-Samvay**
In the Dhaataki-khand dvipa, 68 **chakravattis** are said to have 68 **vijayas** (regions) and 68 capitals. In terms of **ukkosapada**, 68 **arhanta** have been born, are being born, and will be born. Similarly, **chakravatti**, **baladeva**, and **vasudeva** should also be known.
**340:** In the Pushkaravaradvipaardha, 68 **vijayas** and 68 capitals are said to be there. There, 68 **arhanta** have been born, are being born, and will be born in **ukkosapada**. Similarly, **chakravatti**, **baladeva**, and **vasudeva** should also be known.
**Discussion:** Since Mount Meru is located in the middle, the Mahavideha region of Jambudvipa is divided into two parts - the eastern Mahavideha and the western Mahavideha. Then, due to the flow of the Sita river in the east and the Sitoda river in the west, they are further divided into two parts each. Generally, one **tirthankara**, one **chakravatti**, one **baladeva**, and one **vasudeva** are born in each of these four regions. Therefore, at one time, there are four **tirthankara**, four **chakravatti**, four **baladeva**, and four **vasudeva** born. When these four regions are divided by three **antarnadis** and four mountains each, they become 32 regions. These are conquered by the **chakravatti**. Therefore, they are called **vijayadesha** and the **chakravatti** resides in them, hence they are called capitals. Thus, there are a total of 32 **vijayakshetra** and capitals in the Mahavideha of Jambudvipa. By combining the Bharat and Airavat regions, which are two **vijayas** and two capitals, their number becomes 34. The number of **vijayas** and capitals in Dhaataki-khand dvipa and Pushkaravaradvipaardha is double that of Jambudvipa, therefore (34 x 2 = 68) their number becomes 68.

## Ekona-saptati-sthānak-samvāya

**[127 Categories]**

This sutra describes the existence of 68 Vijayas, 68 Rajdhanis, 68 Tirthankaras, 68 Chakravartis, 68 Baladevas, and 68 Vasudevas, keeping in mind the 127 categories.  At least 20 Tirthankaras are born in each of the five Maha-videha regions, and at most 160 Tirthankaras can be born. They reside and travel within their respective regions. The same applies to Chakravartis, etc.  By combining two Bharata and two Airāvata regions associated with each of the five Merus (160+10=170), a total of 170 Tirthankaras and others can be born simultaneously. This is a crucial point to understand.

**341 -** The number of Shramanas with excellent Shramanasampada in the Sangha of Vimalnath Arhan was 68,000.

**|| Ashta-shat-shasti-sthānak-samvāya Samāpt ||**

**Ekona-saptati-sthānak-samvāya 342 -**  Excluding Mandar Parvat, there are 69 Varshas and Varshadhara Parvats in the Samaya-kshetra (human region or 2.5 islands), such as 35 Varshas (regions), 30 Varshadharas (mountains), and 4 Ishukara Parvats.

**Discussion:** There are seven regions associated with one Meru, including Bharata, etc. Therefore, there are 35 regions associated with the five Merus in the 2.5 islands. Similarly, there are six Varshadhara or Kulachal Parvats associated with each Meru, including Himavant, etc. There are two Ishukara Parvats in the Dhataki-khand and two in the Pushkaravardvipa-ardha, making a total of four. Combining all these (35+30+4=69), there are 69 Varshas and Varshadharas.

**343 -** The distance between the westernmost point of Mandar Parvat and the westernmost point of Gautam Dvipa is said to be 69,000 yojanas without any interruption.

**344 -** Excluding Mohaniya Karma, the remaining seven Karma-prakritis have 69 Uttar-prakritis (5+9+2+4+42+2+5=69).

[Samvayanga Sutra, Sapttati Sthanak Samvay - 345] The Bhagwan Mahavira, the great ascetic, used to observe the Vasa (rainy season retreat) for seventy days after twenty days more than four months (fifty days) of the rainy season had passed.
[Commentary] - From the first day of the dark fortnight of Shravan to the fifth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapad, fifty days pass. After this, according to the rules of Vasa, the ascetic would establish himself in one place. Before this, if there was no suitable place for dwelling, he would take shelter in another place.
[346] - The Arhat, the great man, the Parsva, after observing the Shraman Paryaya for seventy years, became a Siddha, a Buddha, free from karmas, attained Nirvana, and became free from all suffering.
[347] - The Arhat, the Vasupujya, was seventy Dhanu (bows) tall.
[348] - The Mohaniya karma, which is free from the period of obstruction, is said to be seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama in its state and its karmanishek.
[Commentary] - The binding of the Mohaniya karma in its excellent state is like seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama. As long as the bound karma does not come into existence and obstruct, it is called the period of obstruction. The general rule for the period of obstruction is that for a karma that binds in the state of one Kodakodi Sagaropama, the period of obstruction is one hundred years. According to this rule, when the binding is in the state of seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama, the period of obstruction is seventy hundred, that is, seven thousand years. After this period of obstruction, the remaining state becomes the karmanishek, which is fit for the karman particles to bear fruit. The order is that after the period of obstruction is complete, in the first time, many karman particles are nishekt, in the second time, fewer than that, in the third time, fewer than that. In this way, the number of karman particles that are nishekt decreases progressively, and in the last time of the state, the fewest karman particles are nishekt. These nishekt karman particles bear fruit in their own time and fall off. This arrangement is according to the karmashastras. But some Aannaryas believe that the period of obstruction for a karma is more than its bound state, so the karman particles are nishekt during the entire time of the bound state.
[349] - The Devendra, the Devraj, the Mahendra, is said to have seventy thousand Saamanik Devas.

The lowermost end of the Ratnaprabha earth is said to be eighty-nine thousand yojanas away from the lowermost end of the Badvamukha Mahapatala Kalasha. Similarly, the distance between the other Mahapatala Kalashas, Ketuk, Yupaka, and Ishvara, should also be known.

**Explanation:** The Ratnaprabha earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick. The Lavana Sea is one thousand yojanas deep. The Badvamukha Patala Kalasha is one lakh yojanas deep from the bottom of the Lavana Sea. The distance between the bottom of the Badvamukha Patala Kalasha and the bottom of the Ratnaprabha earth is eighty-nine thousand yojanas. This is because when one lakh one thousand yojanas (101000) are subtracted from the total thickness of the Ratnaprabha earth (180000), the difference is eighty-nine thousand yojanas (180000 - 101000 = 79000). Similarly, the distance between the bottom of the other three Patala Kalashas and the bottom of the Ratnaprabha earth should also be known as eighty-nine thousand yojanas.

[373]
The lowermost end of the sixth Ghanodadhivat is said to be eighty-nine thousand yojanas away from the middle of the sixth earth, Tamahprabha.

**Explanation:** The thickness of the sixth earth, Tamahprabha, is one lakh sixteen thousand yojanas. If the Ghanodadhivat is considered to be twenty-one thousand yojanas thick according to this text, then the distance between the middle of the earth and the bottom of the Ghanodadhivat is eighty-nine thousand yojanas (58000 + 21000 = 79000). However, according to other texts, the thickness of the Ghanodadhivat below all the earths is said to be twenty thousand yojanas. Therefore, according to them, the distance should be known from the middle of the fifth earth to the bottom of the Ghanodadhivat there. Because the fifth earth is one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas thick. The middle of the earth is fifty-nine thousand yojanas, and the thickness of the Ghanodadhivat is twenty thousand yojanas, which together make eighty-nine thousand yojanas. The Sanskrit commentator has also expressed the possibility that the word "bahu" should be taken to mean one thousand more, i.e., fifty-nine thousand yojanas as the middle part.

Subtracting the width of all four gates, sixteen yojanas, from the said circumference and dividing the remainder by four, the distance between one gate and another is found to be slightly more than nineteen thousand yojanas.

## The Samvayanga Sutra

**Chapter 81**

**Commentary:** This image of a monk requires 81 days to complete.  The first nine days, one offering is received each day.  The next nine days, two offerings are received each day.  This continues, increasing the number of offerings by one each day, until the ninth set of nine days, where nine offerings are received each day.  The total number of offerings is 405 (9+18+27+36+45+54+63+72+81 = 405).  Except for the time of the Gocharikal, the remaining time is spent in silent self-cultivation according to the teachings of the Agamas.

**[138]**

**380:** There were 8100 (Ekkasi-ti Man-pajjavana-nisaya) mind-knowers in the assembly of the Arhat.  The Vyākhyāprajñapti states that there were 81 Maha-yugma-shat.

**Commentary:** The word "shat" here should be understood as referring to study.  One should know from the Agamas, through the study of the various quantities of the Krit-yugma, Dvapara-yugma, etc., the form of the thought and the form of the internal study.

**|| Ekkasi-ti-sthānak Samvāya Samāpt ||**

**Chapter 82**

**381:** In this Jambudvipa, or in any island, the sun traverses one hundred circles (mandala-sayam) twice.  For example, once when it is leaving and once when it is entering.

**Commentary:** There are 184 circles (mandala) through which the sun travels.  Of these, it travels only once through the innermost circle of Jambudvipa and the outermost circle of the Lavana-samudra.  It travels through all the other circles twice - once when entering during the Uttarayana and once when exiting during the Dakshinayana.  This sutra describes this in relation to the 81st sthānak.  It should also be known that although there are only 65 circles above Jambudvipa, they are all referred to as "Jambudvipa" in this sutra, in order to explain the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa, etc., and to describe the area of the sun's travel in relation to this island.

**382:** The Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira was conceived in the womb of Devānanda Brahmani and then transferred to the womb of Shīla Kshatriyani after 81 nights and days.

**383:** The distance between the top of the Mahahimalaya mountain and the bottom of the fragrant mountain (Sogandhiya-kanda) is 100 yojanas.  The same applies to the Ruppi mountain.

[The lowermost end of the Saugandhika Kanda is said to be 8200 yojanas away from the uppermost end of the Mahahimalaya mountain. Similarly, the distance of Rukmi should also be known.
Vivechanaratnaprabha The earth has three Kanda or divisions - Kharakanda, Pankakanda and Abbahul Kanda. Of these, the Kharakanda has sixteen parts - 1. Ratnakanda, 2. Vajrakanda, 3. Vaiduryakanda, 4. Lohitaksha Kanda, 5. Masaragalla, 6. Hasangarbha, 7. Pulaka, 8. Saugandhika, 9. Jyotirras, 10. Anjana, 11. Anjanapulaka, 12. Rajata, 13. Jatarupa, 14. Anka, 15. Sphatika and 16. Rishtkanda. Each of these Kanda is one thousand yojanas thick. In nature, the lowermost part of the eighth Saugandhika Kanda is desired, which is eight thousand yojanas from the upper surface of the Ratnaprabha earth. And the uppermost part of the Mahahimalaya mountain is two hundred yojanas from the upper surface of the Ratnaprabha earth. Thus, adding both (8000+200=8200), the distance of one hundred or eight thousand two hundred yojanas from the upper part of the Mahahimalaya to the lowermost part of the Saugandhika Kanda is proved.
The Rukmi mountain is also two hundred yojanas high, the lowermost part of the said Saugandhika Kanda is also 8200 yojanas away from its upper part.

According to Jain scriptures, the numerical places from shat (hundred), sahasra (thousand), shatsahasra (lakh) etc. to the topmost prahelika, the place where the multiplication by eighty-four starts for the first time is called **svasthan** and the places beyond it are called **sthanaantar**. For example, eighty-four lakh years is a **purvang**. This is **svasthan** and the second place of the **purva** name obtained by multiplying it by eighty-four lakh is **sthanaantar**. Similarly, the place obtained by multiplying the **purva** number by eighty-four lakh is called **trutitang** which is **svasthan** and the place obtained by multiplying it by eighty-four lakh is called **trutit** which is **sthanaantar**. In this way, from **purva** to the topmost **prahelika**, one should know fourteen **svasthan** and fourteen **sthanaantar** with the multiplication of eighty-four lakh.
398- **Ushabhas** had eighty-four **gana**, eighty-four **ganadhar** and eighty-four thousand **shraman** (sadhu) in his time.

The *Samvayanga Sutra* and the *Divasakshetra* (day) communicate in an expanded manner.
Discussion - The sun remains in the *Dakshinayana* for six months and in the *Uttarayana* for six months. When it returns from the outermost circle of the northern direction and enters the *Dakshinayana*, it reduces the measure of the day by two parts out of sixty-one parts of a *muhurta* and increases the measure of the night by the same amount. Thus, when it revolves in the forty-fourth circle, it reduces the day by eighty-eight parts out of sixty-one parts of a *muhurta* and increases the night by the same amount. Similarly, when it goes from *Dakshinayana* to *Uttarayana*, it revolves in the forty-fourth circle, reducing the night by eighty-eight parts out of sixty-one parts and increasing the day by the same amount. Thus, according to the current minute and second, the sun reduces the day by 1 minute and 5120 seconds and increases the night by the same amount during its *Dakshinayana* period. And it revolves, increasing the day by 1 minute and 5120 seconds and reducing the night by the same amount during its *Uttarayana* period. According to the above arrangement, when it revolves in the last circle of *Dakshinayana*, the day is 12 *muhurtas* and the night is 18 *muhurtas*.

**417** - The distance between the topmost peak of all the Vritta-Vaitadhya mountains and the lowermost end of the Saugandhika-kanda is ninety thousand yojanas.

**Explanation:** The Saugandhika-kanda is eight thousand yojanas from the flat surface of the earth, and all the Vritta-Vaitadhya mountains are one thousand yojanas high. Therefore, the difference between the two is ninety thousand yojanas (8000 + 1000 = 9000).

**418** - There are eighty-nine types of Vyayavrittyakarma pratima.

**Explanation:** The term "pratima" here refers to the special type of acceptance of devotion, service, and humility towards the sick sadhus, acharyas, etc.

The eighty-nine types of Vyayavrittyakarma are as follows:

1. Honoring those who are superior in qualities like darshan, jnana, charitra, etc.
2. Standing up when they arrive.
3. Honoring them by giving them clothes, etc.
4. Requesting them to sit down by bringing an asana when they are sitting.

[148]
There are four duties: 1. Performing the Samvayanga Sutra, 2. Showing respect, 3. Praising, and 4. Describing the four varnas (qualities). These four duties, when performed by the fifteen mentioned above (1544-60), become sixty different types.
There are seven types of formal Vinaya: 1. Sitting near a person worthy of Vyavritti (interaction) and learning from them, 2. Following their instructions and acting according to their wishes, 3. Offering food and other necessities with the feeling, "May the Acharya be pleased and give us the Sutras and other teachings," 4. Performing Vinaya specifically for the learned scriptures and practicing their meaning, 5. Investigating those suffering from pain, 6. Knowing the time and place and acting accordingly, 7. Giving permission according to the health of the sick.
There are five types of Acharyas who guide others in the five types of conduct. Besides them, there are fourteen types of Vyavritti with the following: Upadhyaya, Tapasvi, Shaiksha, Glana, Gana, Kula, Sangh, Sadhu, and Manojna.
Thus, there are 91 types of Vinaya: 10 types of Shushrusha Vinaya, 60 types of Anashasana etc. of Tirthankara etc., 7 types of formal Vinaya, and 14 types of Vyavritti of Acharya etc. (10+60+7+14=91).
419-The Kalod ocean is said to be 91 lakh yojanas in circumference, slightly more than the circumference of the earth.
Discussion- Jambudvipa is one lakh yojanas wide, the salt ocean is two lakh yojanas wide, the Dhataki Khand is four lakh yojanas wide, and the Kalod ocean surrounding it is eight lakh yojanas wide. The total diameter of all these is 29 lakh yojanas. According to the calculations, the circumference of the Kalod ocean with such a diameter is 9177605 yojanas, 715 Dhanush, and slightly more than 87 angulas. In the Sutra, it is roughly said to be slightly more than 91 lakh yojanas.
420-There were 9100 Arhats in the assembly of Kunthu, who were Avadhijnani (those who know the limits of space).
421-The six karma-pragatis (types of karma) excluding Ayu and Gotra karma are said to have 91 Uttar-pragatis (5+9+2+28+42+5=91).

##  [Ninety-two-Stana-Samavaya]
[149 Nak-Samavaya 422- Banavay Padhimaao Pannaattao. The images have been described.
Discussion- The names of these images are not mentioned in the original sutra, therefore, according to the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Niyukti, some description of them is being done - In the original, there are five images mentioned - Samadhi-Pratima, Upadhana-Pratima, Vivek-Pratima, Prati-Sanlinata-Pratima and Ekaki-Vihar-Pratima. Among these, Samadhi-Pratima is of two types - Shruta-Samadhi-Pratima and Charitra-Samadhi-Pratima. Darshan-Pratima is not mentioned separately because it is included in knowledge. Shruta-Samadhi-Pratima has sixty-two divisions - five from the first Shruta-Skandha of Acharang, thirty-seven from the second Shruta-Skandha, sixteen from the Stanaang Sutra and four from the Vyavahar Sutra. All these together (5+37+16+4=62) are sixty-two. Although all these images are of the nature of Charitra, however, they are only of specific Shruta-Shali, therefore, due to the predominance of Shruta, they are called Shruta-Samadhi-Pratima.
There are five divisions of Charitra-Samadhi-Pratima in comparison to Samayik, Chhedopasthapaniya, Parihar-Vishuddhi, Sukshma-Samparaya and Yatha-Khyat Charitra.
There are two divisions of Upadhana-Pratima - Bhikku-Pratima and Upasak-Pratima. Among these, Bhikku-Pratima has twelve divisions like Maasi-ki-Bhikku-Pratima, etc. and Upasak-Pratima has eleven divisions like Darshan-Pratima, Vrat-Pratima, etc. Thus, Upadhana-Pratima has (12+11=23) twenty-three divisions.
Although many divisions of Vivek-Pratima are possible in comparison to the internal vices like Krodha, etc. and external objects like Upadhi, Bhakti-Pana, etc., Vivek-Pratima is said to be only one in comparison to the general renunciation.
Prati-Sanlinata-Pratima is also said to be only one, because all three types of Sanlinata like Indriya-Sanlinata, etc. are included in one.
The fifth is Ekaki-Vihar-Pratima, but it is not counted separately because it is included in Bhikku-Pratima.
Thus, Shruta-Samadhi-Pratima sixty-two, Charitra-Samadhi-Pratima five, Upadhana-Pratima twenty-three, Vivek-Pratima one and Prati-Sanlinata-Pratima one, all these together make 62+5+23+1+1=92 Banavay divisions of Pratima.

The Go-stupa Avasa-parvata is located at a distance of one thousand yojanas from the westernmost part of the Mandara mountain, which is in the middle of the Jambudvipa. Similarly, the distance between all four Avasa-parvatas should be known.
Discussion - The boundary of Jambudvipa extends fifty thousand yojanas in all four directions from the middle of Mount Meru. From there, the four Avasa-parvatas, including Go-stupa, are located at a distance of forty-eight thousand yojanas within the Lavana-samudra in all four directions. Therefore, the distance between each Avasa-parvata and the middle of Mount Meru is proven to be one thousand yojanas.

The sun, while moving from Dakshinayana to Uttarayana or returning from Uttarayana to Dakshinayana, makes the equal day and night unequal on the thirteenth mandala.
Discussion - There are 184 mandalas of the sun's movement. When the sun moves on the innermost mandala above Jambudvipa, the day is eighteen muhurtas and the night is twelve muhurtas. Similarly, when the sun moves on the outermost mandala above the Lavana-samudra, the day is twelve muhurtas and the night is eighteen muhurtas. Similarly, when the sun moves on the thirteenth mandala while going to Uttarayana or returning to Dakshinayana, both day and night are equal, i.e., fifteen muhurtas each. If it moves further north, the day starts increasing and the night starts decreasing. And if it moves south, the night starts increasing and the day starts decreasing. Keeping this arrangement in mind, it is said that the sun on the thirteenth mandala, while moving forward or returning, makes the equal day and night unequal.

430-From the extreme end of Jambudvipa, in all four directions, within the Lavanasamudra, there are four Mahapatala Kalashas, which are 59,000 yojanas deep, such as- 1. Vadvamukha, 2. Ketuk, 3. Yupaka and 4. Ishwar.
On both sides of the Lavanasamudra, there are 59,000 regions, which are said to have udvedha (depth) and utsedha (height).
- From the extreme end of this Jambudvipa, in all four directions, within the Lavanasamudra, there are four Mahapatala Kalashas, which are 59,000 yojanas deep, such as- 1. Vadvamukha, 2. Ketuk, 3. Yupaka and 4. Ishwar.
On both sides of the Lavanasamudra, there are 59,000 regions, which are said to have udvedha (depth) and utsedha (height).
Discussion- In the middle of the Lavanasamudra, an area of 10,000 yojanas is 1,000 yojanas deep compared to the Samdharani-tal. After that, as you go towards the Vedika of Jambudvipa, the depth decreases by one region for every 59 regions. As you go further, the depth decreases by one region for every 59 regions. According to this mathematical sequence, for every 59 hands you go, the depth decreases by one hand, for every 59 yojanas you go, the depth decreases by one yojana, and for every 59,000 yojanas you go, the depth decreases by 1,000 yojanas. That means, near the Vedika of Jambudvipa, the bottom of the Lavanasamudra becomes level with the land. Thus, compared to the depth of 1,000 yojanas in the middle of the Lavanasamudra, the coastal part of the Lavanasamudra is 1,000 yojanas high. When you look at this from the side of the sea coast, it means that as you go 59 regions inside the Lavanasamudra from the coast, the height of the water on the coast decreases by one region. As you go further 59 regions, the height of the water on the coast decreases by one region. According to this mathematics, for every 59 hands you go, the height of the water on the coast decreases by one hand, for every 59 yojanas you go, the height of the water on the coast decreases by one yojana, and for every 59,000 yojanas you go, the height of the water on the coast decreases by 1,000 yojanas. Both statements mean the same thing- what is called udvedha or depth in the middle of the sea is called utsedha or height compared to the coastal part of the sea. Thus, it is concluded that as you go 59,000 yojanas ahead from the coast of the Lavanasamudra,

**433** - The Vayu Kumaras (celestial beings) are said to have sixty-nine lakh abodes (buildings).

**434** - The practical danda (unit of measurement) is sixty-nine angulas (inches) in length. Similarly, one should know the measurements of the dhanu (bow), nalika (pipe), yuga (yoke), akkha (axle), and musala (pestle).

**Discussion** - There are two types of angulas: practical and impractical. The angula used for measuring hastas (hands), dhanus (bows), gavyutis (a type of rope), etc., is called the practical angula. The impractical angula varies in size depending on the individual's finger length. It is not being discussed here. One hasta is twenty-four angulas, and one danda is four hastas. Therefore, one danda is sixty-nine angulas (24 x 4 = 96). Similarly, the dhanu, etc., are also sixty-nine angulas in length.

**442 - From the North, the Sun moves towards the South for six months. When it reaches the 49th mandala (circle), it moves for 61 muhurtas (a unit of time) out of 98, decreasing the day-field (day) and increasing the night-field (night). Similarly, from the South, the Sun moves towards the North for six months. When it reaches the 49th mandala, it moves for 61 muhurtas out of 98, decreasing the night-field and increasing the day-field.**

**Commentary - When the Sun moves through one mandala, there is an increase of two parts of the day or a decrease of two parts of the night out of 61 parts of a muhurta. Therefore, when the Sun moves through the 49th mandala, there is an increase or decrease of 61 parts of a muhurta out of 98. Whether the Sun moves from North to South or South to North, the increase or decrease of day or night will remain the same when it revolves around the 49th mandala.**

**443 - The stars of the 19 nakshatras (constellations) from Revati to Jyestha are 98 in number.**

**Commentary - According to astrology, the Revati nakshatra has 32 stars, Ashwini has 3 stars, Bharani has 3 stars, Krittika has 6 stars, Rohini has 5 stars, Mrigashira has 3 stars, Ardra has 1 star, Punarvasu has 5 stars, Pushya has 3 stars, Ashlesha has 6 stars, Magha has 7 stars, Purva Phalguni has 2 stars, Uttara Phalguni has 2 stars, Hasta has 5 stars, Chitra has 1 star, Swati has 1 star, Visakha has 5 stars, Anuradha has 4 stars, and Jyestha has 3 stars. Adding the stars of these 19 nakshatras (32+3+3+6+5+3+1+5+3+6+7+2+2+5+1+1+5+4+3=97), according to other texts, the number is 79. However, the present sutra states that the number of stars in the 19 nakshatras is 98. Therefore, the number of stars in one of the above nakshatras must be one more. Only then will the number 98 mentioned in the sutra be proven. This is the opinion of the commentator.**

[Ninety-Nine Stations-Samvaya]
[155 Ninety-Nine Stations-Samvaya 444-Mandara is said to be 99,000 yojanas high. The distance between the eastern and western extremities of Nandana-vana is said to be 9900 yojanas. Similarly, the distance between the southern and northern extremities of Nandana-vana is said to be 9900 yojanas.
Discussion- Meru mountain is 10,000 yojanas wide on the earth and the outer extent of Meru is 9940 yojanas and 6 parts out of 11 parts of a yojana at the place of Nandana-vana which is situated at a height of 500 yojanas. And the inner extent is 9940 yojanas and 6 parts out of 11 parts of a yojana. The width of Nandana-vana is 500 yojanas. Thus, the inner extent of Meru and the extent of 500 yojanas of Nandana-vana on both sides, all together, almost become the distance mentioned in the sutras.
445- The first solar circle in the north is said to be 99,000 yojanas in diameter. The second solar circle is also said to be 99,000 yojanas in diameter. The third solar circle is also said to be 99,000 yojanas in diameter.
Discussion- The celestial path on which the sun revolves around Meru is called the solar circle. When it revolves on the first circle in the north, the length of that circle in the form of a sphere is 99,640 yojanas. When the sun revolves on the second circle, its length is 99,645 yojanas and 35 parts out of 61 parts of a yojana. The reason for the increase of 5 yojanas and 35 parts out of 61 parts from the first circle to the second circle is that the difference between one circle and another is 2 yojanas and the diameter of the sun's plane is 48 parts out of 61 parts of a yojana. Doubling this gives an increase of 5 yojanas and 35 parts out of 61 parts of a yojana from the first

##  Translation:

[156]
The second mandala of the Samavayanga Sutra is established. Similarly, by adding 535 to the diameter of the second mandala (99645 + 535 = 99651 - 9), the diameter of the third mandala is obtained as ninety-nine thousand six hundred and fifty-one yojanas and nine parts out of sixty-one parts of a yojana. The increase of 640 yojanas in the first mandala, 645 35/69 yojanas in the second mandala, and 6519 yojanas in the third mandala, which is mentioned in the sutra as 'saatireka' and 'saadhik', means 'slightly more than ninety-nine thousand yojanas'.

446 - From this, the upper limit of the abodes of the Vana-vyantara Bhoumeyaka Devas is said to be ninety-nine hundred yojanas away from the lower limit of the Anjana Kanda of the Ratnaprabha earth.

Discussion - The Anjana Kanda is the tenth of the sixteen Kanda's of the first Kharakanda of the Ratnaprabha earth. Its lower limit is ten thousand yojanas away from here. The cities of the Vyanta Devas are located after the first hundred yojanas of the first Ratna Kanda. Subtracting these hundred from ten thousand (10,000 - 100 = 9900) gives the sutra-mentioned distance of ninety-nine hundred (9900) yojanas.

Discussion - The worship of this Bhikshu Pratimas is done through ten-day periods, i.e., one hundred days. Similar to the previously mentioned Bhikshu Pratimas, one Bhikshadatti is received each day from the first ten days to the tenth ten-day period. Accordingly, the total number of Bhikshadattis (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90 + 100 = 550) becomes five hundred and fifty. The remaining worship rituals should be understood as similar to the previous Pratimas.

Similarly, there are two mountains named Chitra-vichitra on both sides of the Sitoda river in Devakuru, south of the Nishadha mountain. Therefore, there are five Sita and Sitoda rivers in the Ardha-dvipa, hence the reference to ten Yamak Kutas in this sutra. They are all one thousand yojanas high, one thousand koshas deep in the earth, and circular in shape, making them one thousand yojanas in diameter.

He has also written that this could be a mistake by the scribe. Or, due to the similarity of the word "sahasra", this sutra may have been placed in the middle of the numbers in the "shatasahasra". In fact, it should be placed in the number nine thousand. Therefore, the original text and its translation have been given in square brackets [ ] there.

The twelve Angas of the Ganipitaka are described as follows: 1. Acharanga, 2. Sutra-kritanga, 3.  Sthananga, 4. Samavayanga, 5. Vyākhyāprajñapti, 6. Jñātādharmakathā, 7. Upāsakadaśā, 8. Antakṛtdaśā, 9. Anuttaroppapātikadaśā, 10. Praśnavyākaraṇa, 11. Vipākasūtra, and 12. Dṛṣṭivāda.

An Acharya who holds the group or collection of virtues is called a Ganī. The meaning of Pitaka is a casket, box, or chest. The casket of the all-encompassing Shruta-ratnas of the Acharyas is called the Ganipitaka. Just as a human being has eight limbs, similarly, the twelve limbs of the Shruta-rupa Parampurush are called the Dvadashaanga Shruta.

## [512]
What is this Acharanga? What is described in it?

The Acharanga describes the conduct, gochari, vinaya, vainayika (vinaya-phal) sthana, gaman, chankraman, praman, yoga-yojan, language, samiti, gupti, shayya, upadhi, bhakta, pan, udgam, utpadan, eshanavishuddhi, shuddha-grahan, ashudha-grahan, vrata, niyam, and tapa upadhan of the Shraman Nirgranthas in a well-established manner.

**Explanation:** Those who continuously strive in the practice of Shruta and the observance of restraint, free from all kinds of beginnings and acquisitions, are called Shraman Nirgrantha sadhus. The Acharanga describes how their conduct should be, how they should perform gochari, whose vinaya they should follow and how, how they should stand, how they should walk, how they should move around within the shelter to relieve bodily fatigue, what the proof of their upadhi should be, how they should engage themselves and others in swadhyaya, pratilekhan, etc., what kind of language they should speak, how they should follow the five samitis and three guptis, how they should investigate the origins and productions of defects in shayya, upadhi, food, drink, etc., how they should purify the defects found in them, how they should observe the various vratas (mulguna), niyams (uttaraguna), and tapa upadhan (twelve types of tapas), and all these duties are described in the Acharanga in the best possible way.

## [513]
The Acharanga is described in five ways: 1. Jnana-Acharanga, 2. Darshan-Acharanga, 3. Charitra-Acharanga, 4. Tapa-Acharanga, and 5. Viriya-Acharanga.

The Acharanga has many parts: 1. Vayanas, 2. Anuyogadaras, 3. Padivattis, 4. Vedhas, 5. Silogas, and 6. Nijjuttis.

## The Twelve Angas of the Ganipitaka: The Achar

**The Achar is the first Anga in the Ganipitaka, and it is divided into five types:**

* **Jnanachar:** This refers to eight types of conduct related to knowledge, such as:
    * Disciplining oneself in knowledge
    * Studying and reciting scriptures during the time dedicated to study
    * Not concealing the name of one's Guru
* **Darshanachar:** This refers to eight types of conduct related to right faith, such as:
    * Not doubting the truths spoken by the Jinas
    * Not desiring worldly pleasures
    * Not being doubtful
* **Charitrachar:** This refers to the flawless observance of the five great vows, the five samitis, and other aspects of conduct.
* **Tapachara:** This refers to the practice of both external and internal austerities.
* **Viryachara:** This refers to not concealing one's strength in fulfilling one's duties and performing them to the best of one's ability.

**The Achar is also a scripture that expounds upon these five types of conduct.**

**The Acharang has a limited number of readings (parit) that explain its sutras.** These readings are given only during the time of the karmabhoomi (the realm of action) in the ascending and descending cycles of time. They are not given during the akarmabhoomi (the realm of no action) or the bhogabhoomi (the realm of enjoyment).

**The Acharang also has a limited number of Anuyogadwaras, which are the means of understanding the nature of reality.** These include:

* **Upkram:** The beginning or introduction
* **Nay:** The method or approach
* **Nikeshep:** The deposit or conclusion
* **Anugam:** The following or continuation

**The Acharang also has a limited number of:**

* **Pratipattis:** These are statements that explain the nature of reality.
* **Veshtkas:** These are specific types of verses or stanzas that explain a particular topic.
* **Shlokas:** These are verses in the Anushtup meter, which have eight syllables in each line.
* **Niyuktis:** These are explanations of the concise meaning of the sutras, with etymological derivations and logical arguments.

**The Acharang is a vast and complex scripture, containing:**

* **Two Suyakhandas:** Chapters or sections
* **Nineteen Ajjhayanas:** Lessons or teachings
* **Eighty-five Uddesanakalas:** Sections dedicated to the purpose or goal
* **Eighty-five Samuddesanakalas:** Sections dedicated to the explanation of the purpose or goal
* **Eighteen thousand Padas:** Words or verses
* **Countless Aksharas:** Letters
* **Countless Pazzavas:** Sentences
* **Countless Thavaras:** Permanent or unchanging things
* **Countless Sasayas:** Living beings
* **Countless Kadas:** Chapters or sections
* **Countless Nikaiyas:** Collections or groups
* **Countless Jinpannattas:** Statements made by the Jinas
* **Countless Bhavas:** States of being

**The Acharang is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom, and it is essential for understanding the teachings of Jainism.**

##  [170]
The Samvayanga Sutra is a part of the Shruta Skandha, it has twenty-five studies, eighty-five Uddeshan-kalas, and eighty-five Samuddeshan-kalas. In terms of word count, it has eighteen thousand words, countless letters, and infinite meanings. This is because every object has infinite qualities, and therefore, the doors to knowing them, the forms of knowledge, are also infinite. The synonyms are also infinite because the qualities of an object are infinite. The number of Trasa Jivas is limited, while the number of Sthavar Jivas is infinite. All substances are eternal (Nitya) from the perspective of Dravyarthic Nay, and impermanent (Anitya) from the perspective of Paryayarthic Nay. All substances are bound (Grathit) and unbound (Nikachit) in the Sutras, meaning they are established through principles, collections, reasons, examples, etc. In this Acharanga, the teachings (Prajnapta) of the Jina Dev are stated in a general way, they are specifically explained, they are shown through reasons and examples, they are specifically defined, and they are explained through Upanaya-Nigama.

The study of Acharanga makes one knowledgeable about the true nature of the soul and the principles of conduct, it makes one knowledgeable about the specific qualities and their synonyms, and it also makes one knowledgeable about other philosophies. In this way, the principles of conduct like Achar-Gochari, etc., and the principles of purification like Pind-Shuddhi, etc., are explained briefly, explained in detail, shown through reasons and examples, specifically defined, and explained through Upanaya-Nigama. ||1||

## 515- What is the content of the Sutra?
The Sutra describes the following:
* Things that are present in the current time (Swasamaya)
* Things that are present in the past time (Parasamaya)
* Things that are present in both the current and past time (Swasamaya-Parasamaya)
* Jivas (living beings)
* Ajivas (non-living beings)
* Both Jivas and Ajivas
* The Lok (universe)
* The Alok (non-universe)
* Both Lok and Alok

## 516-
The Sutra also describes all things, including Jivas, Ajivas, Puny (merit), Pap (demerit), Asrava (influx), Samvara (restriction), Nirjara (destruction), Bandha (bondage), and Moksha (liberation). 

It describes the state of those Shramans who have taken vows for a short period of time, whose minds are confused by listening to false teachings or principles, whose hearts are agitated by doubts arising from the truth, and who are suffering from the effects of the four types of impurities (Pavakar, Malina, Mai, and Guna-Visohan). It also describes the state of those who are engaged in eighty-four types of non-virtuous actions, seventy-seven types of non-beneficial actions, thirty-two types of harmful actions, and the three types of wrong views (Tevatthi). 

The Sutra also describes the state of those who are firmly established in the right path, who have attained knowledge, faith, and conduct, who have a clear vision, who are well-versed in various scriptures, who have understood the ultimate nature of things, who are endowed with the qualities of the Supreme Being, who are free from delusion, who are like lamps in the darkness of ignorance, who are radiant, who have attained the highest state of liberation, who are free from fear and trembling, and who are well-established in the truth.

[Samvayanga Sutra]

This is elaborated in the Angas. It also discusses in detail the nature of Jiva-Ajiva, Lok-Alok, punya-papa, etc. Although there are countless different opinions about the nature of the Tattvas, based on their own imaginations, they are broadly divided into four categories. They are: 1. Kriyavadi, 2. Akriyavadi, 3. Agnanika, and 4. Vainayika. Their brief description is as follows:

1. **Kriyavadi:** Those who believe in punya-papa, bandha-moksha, and their causative actions, but hold onto a single side, are called Kriyavadi. Their number is one hundred and eighty. It is as follows: Kriyavadi believe in nine substances: Jiva, Ajiva, Asrava, Bandha, Samvara, Nirjara, Punya, Papa, and Moksha. Again, some believe in each substance as being self-existent (svatah), while others believe it to be dependent (paratah). Therefore, there are eighteen divisions of the nine substances. Again, some believe in these eighteen divisions as being eternal (nitya), while others believe them to be non-eternal (anitya). Therefore, multiplying eighteen by two, there are thirty-six divisions. Again, some believe these thirty-six divisions to be caused by time (kalakruta), some by God (ishvarakruta), some by the self (atmakruta), some by destiny (niyatikruta), and some by nature (svabhavakruta). Thus, multiplying the said thirty-six divisions by these five beliefs (36 x 5 = 180), there are one hundred and eighty divisions of Kriyavadi.

2. **Akriyavadi:** They do not believe in punya and papa, but only in the seven substances, including Jiva, and some believe them to be self-existent (svatah), while others believe them to be dependent (paratah). Therefore, multiplying seven by these two divisions, there are fourteen divisions. Again, some believe these fourteen divisions to be caused by time (kalakruta), some by God (ishvarakruta), some by the self (atmakruta), some by destiny (niyatikruta), some by nature (svabhavakruta), and some by chance (yadrichchhajanita). Thus, multiplying the said fourteen substances by these six beliefs (14 x 6 = 84), there are eighty-four divisions of Akriyavadi.

3. **Agnanika:** Their belief is that who knows if there is a Jiva or not? Is there an Ajiva or not? And so on. They put the Jiva and other substances in the confusion of ignorance. And regarding the seven bhangas (categories) by which the Jina Dev has described these nine substances: (1) Syadasti, (2) Syannaasti, (3) Syadasti-naasti, (4) Syadavaktvy, (5) Syadasti-avaktvy, (6) Syannaasti-avaktvy, and (7) Syadasti-naasti-avaktvy, they also express ignorance about them. Thus, due to the ignorance of the said seven bhangas regarding the nine substances, there are sixty-three divisions (9 x 7 = 63). And besides the nine substances, they also express ignorance about the tenth, the origin, through the first four bhangas out of the said seven. Thus, adding these four divisions to the said sixty-three, there are sixty-seven divisions of Agnanika.

4. **Vainayika:** They consider it a duty to be respectful to everyone. According to their belief, it is a duty to be respectful in mind, speech, and body to: 1. Dev, 2. Nripati, 3. Gnāti, 4. Yati, 5. Stavira (Elder), 6. Adhama, 7. Mata, and 8. Pita, and to give them charity. Thus, multiplying the said eight by mind, speech, body, and charity, there are thirty-two divisions (8 x 4 = 32) of Vainayika.

The Jain terms have been preserved in the translation:

The Jñātādharmakathā describes the following about the ascetics who have taken vows:

1. Those whose firmness (dhīti), intellect (mati), and effort (vyavasāya) are weak in upholding the vow of restraint (saṃyama-pratijñā) in the excellent doctrine of the Victorious Lord (jina-bhagavat's śāsana).

2. Those who are broken down by the heavy burden of the fierce battle (raṇa) of observing the rules (niyama) and practices (tapovahāna) of austerities.

3. Those who have been defeated by the terrible parīṣahas (hardships), and have fallen from the pure path of mokṣa due to the obstruction of the siddha-ālaya (abode of the perfected ones).

4. Those who are infatuated by the worthless pleasures of the senses and afflicted by passions.

5. Those who are devoid of the essence of the various qualities of the ascetic life, such as character, knowledge, and perception.

6. Those who are entangled in the endless cycle of transmigration and various miserable states of existence.

7. The courageous ones who have conquered the armies of passions, are firm in their restraint, and aspire for the pure path of knowledge, perception, and conduct leading to liberation.

8. Having enjoyed the incomparable divine pleasures of the celestial abodes, they eventually fall from that state due to the natural course of time, and then attain the final rites (antakriyā).

9. The scriptures provide guidance and instruction for the ascetics, highlighting both their virtues and faults, so that the wise monks may firmly establish themselves in the doctrine that destroys old age and death, and attain the eternal, auspicious, and complete liberation from all suffering.

Who else has seen the emergence of the assemblies of gods, demons, and humans? Those great souls who, upon approaching the Jinas, worship them in such a way, and the Jinas, the Lokagurus of the demons, humans, and gods, who teach them Dharma in such a way. Those who are of diminished karma, great souls, upon hearing the Dharma taught by them, become detached from all their actions and enjoyments, and from the objects of the senses, and accept the noble Dharma, and various forms of restraint and austerity, and who, by practicing them for many years, cultivate knowledge, insight, and conduct, and, following the Jina's words, teach the revered Dharma to other worthy beings, and cause their disciples to study, and worship the Jinas with their hearts, and who, by fasting, attain liberation, and, being endowed with supreme meditative concentration, are born in the highest planes, and there enjoy incomparable pleasures, all this is described in the Anuttaroppapātika-daśā. Thereafter, upon falling from there, how they will practice restraint and engage in the final act, and attain liberation, all this, and other meanings like this, are described in detail in this Anga.

In the Anuttaroppapātika-daśā, there are concise recitations, enumerated Anuyogadvāras, enumerated understandings, enumerated Veḍhas, enumerated Ślokas, enumerated deployments, and enumerated collections.
545 - Se ṇam aṅgaṭṭayāe navamae aṅge, ege suyakkhandhe, dasa ajjhayaṇā, tinni vaggā, dasa uddeśaṇakālā, dasa samuddeśaṇakālā, saṅkhejjāiṁ payasayasahassāiṁ payaggeṇam paṇṇattaiṁ.

546 – Se kiṁ tam paṇhāvāgaraṇāṇi? Paṇhāvāgaraṇesu aṭṭuttaraṁ pasaṇasayaṁ aṭṭuttaraṁ apasiṇasayaṁ aṭṭuttaraṁ pasiṇāpasiṇasayaṁ vijjāisayā nāga - suvannehiṁ saddiṁ divvā saṁvāyā āghavijjati.
1.
The commentator says: A group of studies is called a section. There are ten studies in a section, and the setting forth of the subject of one section takes place at the same time. Therefore, there should only be three times of setting forth the subject. The Nandī-sūtra also mentions only three. But here, what is the meaning of saying ten times of setting forth the subject, is not clear. - Editor.

**What is the *Prashnavyakaran* Anga? What does it describe?**

The *Prashnavyakaran* Anga describes one hundred and eight questions, one hundred and eight non-questions, and one hundred and eight question-questions, along with the excellences of knowledge and divine dialogues with Nagas and Suparnas.

**Explanation:**

Mantras like *Angushthaprashna* etc. are called *Prashnas*. The knowledge that reveals auspicious and inauspicious results when asked by the seeker is called *Prashna-vidya*. The knowledge that reveals auspicious and inauspicious results without being asked, through the practice of mantras, is called *A-prashna-vidya*. And the knowledge that reveals auspicious and inauspicious results by asking some questions and not asking others is called *Prashna-prashna-vidya*. All three types of knowledge are described in the *Prashnavyakaran* Anga. 

*Sthambhan*, *Vashikaran*, *Uccatan* etc. are called *Vidya-atishya*. And the divine conversation that the seeker has with Naga-Kumaras, Suparna-Kumaras, and Yakshas etc. during the time of acquiring knowledge is called *Divya-samvad*. All of this is described in this Anga.

**547 -** The *Prashnavyakaran* Anga describes in detail the words spoken by various Buddhas, who are knowers of the present and past times, using languages with diverse meanings. It also describes the various teachings of the Acharyas, who expound on *Aamanshadhi* etc. excellences, knowledge, and other qualities, and the state of *Upasham*. It describes the numerous, beneficial, and detailed sayings of the great sages, who are the heroes of the world. It describes the answers given by the *Vidya-Devatas* through the medium of *Angushtha*, *Bahhu*, *Asi*, *Mani*, *Kshoum* (cloth), and *Surya* etc. (symbols). 

Many *Maha-prashna-vidyas* answer questions simply by being spoken. Many *vidyas* answer questions that are thought of in the mind. Many *vidyas* reveal the qualities of various *Adhisthata-Devatas* through their specific uses, and through their dialogues, they illuminate various meanings. They amaze the people with their true and double-effecting answers. 

The miracles and true words of these *vidyas* create a firm belief in the hearts of people that the *Jina-Tirthankaras* who were the holders of *Dam* and *Sham* in the past, were distinct from the teachers of other religions, and that they were truthful. Otherwise, such true *Vidya-mantras* would not be possible. Thus, the *Prashnavyakaran* Anga describes the various qualities and great meanings of the questions that are difficult to understand and difficult to penetrate, that are accepted by all the omniscient ones, that enlighten the ignorant, that are directly perceived, and that are the answers given by the *Jina-varas*. These answers are declared, shaped, exemplified, and shown.

[553]
Duḥkhavipaga describes the painful results of bad deeds, including violence, false speech, theft, adultery, attachment, intense passions, indulgence in sense pleasures, negligence, evil actions, and negative intentions. These bad deeds lead to suffering in hell, animal realms, and various other forms of existence, where one experiences countless hardships. Even after being reborn as a human, the residue of past bad deeds continues to cause suffering, such as beatings, castration, nose-cutting, ear-cutting, lip-piercing, finger-cutting, hand-cutting, foot-cutting, nail-cutting, tongue-cutting, branding with hot iron, burning on a bed of thorns, being crushed under an elephant's foot, being torn apart with a sword, being hung from a tree, being pierced with a trident, being beaten with a club, being broken with a stick, being burned with hot iron, being poured with molten lead and oil, being cooked in a furnace, being drenched with ice-cold water in winter, being tied up with ropes, being pierced with spears, being skinned alive, being tortured with fire, and other terrible punishments. These sufferings are endless and cannot be escaped due to the chain of bad karma. There is no liberation for those who are bound by their passions. Therefore, it is important to be mindful and avoid these actions.

[187 Setting fire] etc. are extremely cruel, they have to suffer incomparable pain. The sinful beings bound in many births and traditions do not escape the fruits of the sinful karma-vine without suffering. Because there is no escape from the fruits of karma without experiencing them. Yes, those who have tightened their belts with the patience of citta-samadhi, their tapasya purifies even those sinful karmas.
554-Those who are well-behaved in the conduct of virtue, restraint, rules, qualities and tapasya, who are well-established in their conduct, who use compassion in many ways, who have pure intellect in all three times, i.e. who are happy thinking that they will give food to the ascetics, who are happy while giving and after giving, who give food and drink to them with a very careful mind, beneficial, pleasant, auspicious, good results, pure in use (free from the defects of origin etc.), they earn merit like humans, attain bodhi-laabh and abandon many transmigrations related to human, hell, animal and heavenly realms (limited-less), and which is troubled by the mountain of aversion, fear, wonder, sorrow and false belief (mountain), which is full of deep ignorance-darkness-like mud, which is very difficult to cross, whose chakraval (water-circle) is disturbed by the crocodiles of old age, death and womb, which is very fierce because it is endless and full of sixteen kshaya-like ferocious animals, they cross such endless, endless, this samsara-ocean, and how they bind themselves to life in the deva-ganas, how they experience the incomparable pleasures of the deva-ganas' vimanas, and then after a long time, they fall from there and come to this human world, having a long life, a perfect body, a beautiful form, born in a good family, endowed with health, intelligence, special intelligence, rich in friends, relatives, wealth, grain and wealth, and combined with a group of essential happiness, they enjoy many kinds of pleasures born of desires.

The Bhagavan Jinavara has made the description of the fruits of karma, both auspicious and inauspicious, in many ways, in the form of a description of the fruits of karma. Others also describe these in many ways in detail with the explanation of the meaning.

Now the fruits of happiness are described which are engaged in the practice of virtue, (brahmacharya or samadhi), restraint, rules (abhigraha-special), qualities (root qualities and subsequent qualities) and tapasya (inner-outer), who follow their conduct well, such virtuous people use compassion in many ways, they have pure intellect in all three times, i.e. they are happy thinking that they will give food to the ascetics, they are happy while giving and after giving, they give them food and drink with a very careful mind, beneficial, pleasant, auspicious, good results, pure in use (free from the defects of origin etc.), they earn merit like humans, attain bodhi-laabh and abandon many transmigrations related to human, hell, animal and heavenly realms (limited-less), and which is troubled by the mountain of aversion, fear, wonder, sorrow and false belief (mountain), which is full of deep ignorance-darkness-like mud, which is very difficult to cross, whose chakraval (water-circle) is disturbed by the crocodiles of old age, death and womb, which is very fierce because it is endless and full of sixteen kshaya-like ferocious animals, they cross such endless, endless, this samsara-ocean, and how they bind themselves to life in the deva-ganas, how they experience the incomparable pleasures of the deva-ganas' vimanas, and then after a long time, they fall from there and come to this human world, having a long life, a perfect body, a beautiful form, born in a good family, endowed with health, intelligence, special intelligence, rich in friends, relatives, wealth, grain and wealth, and combined with a group of essential happiness, they enjoy many kinds of pleasures born of desires.

The aforementioned seven Perikarma are according to the Svasamayika (Jain) view, seven are according to the Ajivika view, six are according to the Chatushkanaya view, and seven are according to the Trairasika view. Thus, these seven Perikarma are eighty-three in number, considering the differences in the past and present. This is all the Perikarma.
Discussion - Sanskrit commentators write that the Perikarma have become disconnected from the sutras and their meaning. Of these seven Perikarma, the first six are Svasamayika. And, according to the Ajivikapa-khandaka view, propagated by Goshalak, there are seven types of Perikarma.
According to the Digambara tradition, the Perikarma describes the Karanasutras of mathematics. There are five types of these - Chandra-prajnapti, Surya-prajnapti, Jambudvipa-prajnapti, Dvipa-sagara-prajnapti, and Vyakhya-prajnapti.

[190]
What is the nature of the Sutra? It is said that there are eighty-eight Sutras, such as: 1. Ṛjūk, 2. Pariṇatāpariṇat, 3. Bahubhangik, 4. Vijayacarcā, 5. Anantara, 6. Parampara, 7. Samāna (Samānas), 8. Sanjūha-Samyūtha (Jūha), 9. Sambhinna, 10. Ahāccaya, 11. Sauvastika, 12. Nandyaavarta, 13. Bahul, 14. Pṛṣṭāpṛṣṭ, 15. Vyāvṛtta, 16. Evambhūta, 17. Dvyāavarta, 18. Vartamānātmaka, 19. Samabhirūḍha, 20. Sarvatobhadra, 21. Paṇāma (Paṇṇāsa) and 22. Duṣpraṭigraha. These twenty-two Sutras are Chinnacchedanayik according to the Svasamayasūtra Paripāṭī. These same twenty-two Sutras are Acchinnacchedanayik according to the Ājīvikasūtra Paripāṭī. These same twenty-two Sutras are Trikanayik according to the Trairāśikasūtra Paripāṭī and these same twenty-two Sutras are Caturṣkanayik according to the Svasamayasūtra Paripāṭī. Thus, all these, with their respective differences, make up eighty-eight Sutras, it is said. This is the second distinction of the name Sutra.

**Explanation:**
The one who accepts the Nayasutra with Chhinna, i.e., with distinction, is called Chinnacchedanayik. For example, the verse Sutra "Dhammo Mangalamukkiḷam" etc., does not depend on any other verse for the exposition of its meaning, in terms of both the verse and its meaning. But the verse which depends on the verse before or after it for the exposition of its meaning is called Acchinnacchedanayik. Gosālaka etc. accept these three Nayas: Dravyārthika, Paryāyārthika and Ubhāyārthika, hence they are called Trikanayik. But those who accept these four Nayas: Sangraha, Vyavahāra, Ṛjusūtra and Śabda, are called Caturṣkanayik. Those who are Trikanayik, describe all things in terms of Sat, Asat and Ubhāyātmaka. But those who are Caturṣkanayik, describe all things with the help of the aforementioned four Nayas.

[563]
What is the Pūrvagaya? It is said that there are fourteen types of Pūrvagaya, such as: 1. Utpādapūrv, 2. Agrayāṇīpūrv, 3. Vīryapravādapūrv, 4. Astināstipravāda pūrv, 5. Jñānapravādapūrv, 6. Satyapravādapūrv, 7. Ātmapravāda pūrv, 8. Karmapravāda pūrv, 9. Pratyākyānapravādapūrv, 10. Vidyānu pravāda pūrv, 11. Abandhyapūrv, 12. Prāṇāyupūrv, 13. Kriyāviśāla pūrv and 14. Lokabindu sārapūrv.

The Samvayanga Sutra, through the delineation of charana and karana, describes, explains, demonstrates, and illustrates the nature of reality. This is the twelfth drishtivada anga. This is the description of the Dvadasanga Ganipitaka [12].
571 - This Dvadasanga Ganipitaka, in the past, caused countless jivas, devoid of knowledge, to wander in the wilderness of the four gatis. This Dvadasanga Ganipitaka, in the present, causes limited jivas, devoid of knowledge, to wander in the wilderness of the four gatis. This Dvadasanga Ganipitaka, in the future, will cause countless jivas, devoid of knowledge, to wander in the wilderness of the four gatis.
Countless jivas, in the past, wandered in the wilderness of the four gatis, having violated the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form, i.e., by being under the influence of wrong views, by reciting the sutras incorrectly, by explaining the meaning incorrectly, and by incorrectly delineating the sutras and their meaning. Limited jivas, in the present, are wandering in the wilderness of the four gatis, having violated the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form. Countless jivas, in the future, will wander in the wilderness of the four gatis, having violated the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form.
572 - This Dvadasanga Ganipitaka, in the past, caused countless jivas, having attained knowledge, to cross the wilderness of the four gatis. Similarly, in the present, limited jivas, having attained knowledge, are crossing the wilderness of the four gatis. Similarly, in the future, countless jivas, having attained knowledge, will cross the wilderness of the four gatis.
Countless jivas, in the past, crossed the wilderness of the four gatis (attained liberation), having adhered to the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form. Limited jivas, in the present, are crossing the wilderness of the four gatis, having adhered to the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form. Countless jivas, in the future, will cross the wilderness of the four gatis, having adhered to the injunctions of this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka in its sutra form, its meaning, and its combined form.
573 - This Dvadasanga Ganipitaka was never in the past, it is not in the present, and it will never be in the future. However, it was in the past, it is in the present, and it will be in the future. It is eternally established, like the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, and the earth. Just as the five atthikas were never in the past, they are not in the present, and they will never be in the future, but they were in the past, they are in the present, and they will be in the future, eternally established like the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, and the earth. Similarly, this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka was never in the past, it is not in the present, and it will never be in the future. However, it was in the past, it is in the present, and it will be in the future, eternally established. 
Because this Dvadasanga Ganipitaka...

## The Twelve Angas of the Ganipitaka

[The Twelve Angas of the Ganipitaka]
[195] The Meru mountain is like a pole, the Lokas are like a fixed point, time is like the eternal, and the Twelve Angas are inexhaustible because they do not diminish even with continuous recitation. They are imperishable like the flow of the Ganga and Sindhu rivers, they are situated like Jambudvipa and the other continents, and they are eternal like the sky. Just as the five Astikaya dravyas were never not in the past, are never not in the present, and will never not be in the future, so too, the Twelve Angas were never not in the past, are never not in the present, and will never not be in the future. Therefore, they are a pole, fixed, eternal, inexhaustible, imperishable, situated, and eternal.

[574] In this Twelve Angas Ganipitaka, there are infinite Bhavas (real substances like Jivas), infinite Abhavas (non-real substances like the absence of Jivas), infinite Hetus (reasons), infinite Ahetus (non-reasons), infinite Karana (causes), infinite Akarana (non-causes), infinite Jivas (living beings), infinite Ajivas (non-living beings), infinite Bhavyasiddhikas (those capable of liberation), infinite Abhavyasiddhikas (those incapable of liberation), infinite Siddhas (liberated beings), and infinite Asiddhas (bound beings). They are explained, described, illustrated, shown, demonstrated, and explained in detail.

Thus, the Twelve Angas Ganipitaka is described.

**Explanation:** In Jain philosophy, just as there are infinite Dharmas (characteristics) in the form of reality in every object, so too, there are infinite Abhavas (non-real characteristics) in the form of non-reality. Therefore, the Sutra describes the Bhavas (real characteristics) in terms of reality and the Abhavas (non-real characteristics) in terms of non-reality. The arguments that prove the specific Dharmas of a substance are called Hetus. The material and efficient causes of substances are called Karana. Those who possess consciousness are called Jivas, and those who do not possess consciousness are called Ajivas. Those who are capable of attaining liberation are called Bhavyasiddhikas, and those who are not capable of attaining liberation are called Abhavyasiddhikas. Liberated beings who are free from karma are called Siddhas, and bound beings who are still subject to karma are called Asiddhas. In this way, the Twelve Angas Ganipitaka describes all the principles, realities, and substances that exist in the world.

Thus, the description of the Twelve Angas Ganipitaka is complete.

**Conclusion:** The subject matter of the Twelve Angas Shrutajnana is vast. Describing the glory of Shrutajnana...

Page #315:
---------------------------
[196]
The Acharya's who have attained Samyak-Jnana have declared the importance of Shruta-Jnana by saying "There is a difference between Shruta-Jnana and Kevala-Jnana, which is direct and indirect."  Kevala-Jnana directly knows the three realms, the three periods of time, the substances, their qualities and their modifications, as if holding them in the hand. Shruta-Jnana knows all of these indirectly. Therefore, no element of the world is outside of the twelve-limbed Shruta. All elements are contained within this twelve-limbed Ganipitaka. The eleven Angas, starting with Acharanga, primarily describe one subject each, such as conduct. However, the twelfth Anga, Dristivad, describes all the elements of the world. In its previous sections, it describes the nature of the many previous things, such as the production, destruction, and impermanence of the beginning of production. It describes the powers of the substance, starting with the section on the seed, the many Dharma-like qualities, starting with the section on existence and non-existence, the nature of the soul, starting with the sections on knowledge and the soul, and the states of karma, starting with the section on karma. It describes the many types of atonement, starting with the section on rejection, the mantras and tantras, starting with the section on Vidya-vad, the eight limbs of Ayurveda, starting with the section on Pranaprava, the eight great causes, starting with the section on space, the earth, the voice, dreams, signs, consonants, and the broken, and the secrets of astrology. It describes the actions that are never fruitless and beneficial, starting with the section on the unhindered. It describes actions, starting with the section on the vastness of actions, the sixty-four arts of women and the seventy-two arts of men, and poetry, meter, and figures of speech. It describes the remaining wealth of Shruta, starting with the section on the essence of the world. Thus, there is no subject that is useful for life and the soul that is not described in these fourteen sections. The subjects of narrative, mathematics, etc. are described in the remaining four sections of Dristivad. Thus, the subject of the twelve-limbed Shruta is very vast.

## Diverse Subjects Explained 576 - Two categories are mentioned, namely - Jiva-rasi and Ajivara-rasi. Ajivara-rasi is further divided into two categories, namely - Ruvi Ajivara-rasi and Aruvi Ajivara-rasi.

## 577 - What is Aruvi Ajivara-rasi? Aruvi Ajivara-rasi is mentioned as having ten categories, namely - Dhamma-stikaya, Dhamma-stikaya-desa, Dhamma-stikaya-padesa, Adhamma-stikaya, Adhamma-stikaya-desa, Adhamma-stikaya-padesa, Aagasa-stikaya, Aagasa-stikaya-desa, Aagasa-stikaya-padesa and Addha-samaya.

## 578 - Ruvi Ajivara-rasi is mentioned as having many categories... [What is Ruvi Ajivara-rasi?] Ruvi Ajivara-rasi is mentioned as having many categories...

## Explanation - The description of Ruvi Ajivara-rasi and Jiva-rasi is not given here, only the word "Jāv" is used to indicate that it should be understood according to the first chapter of the Prajnapana Sutra, named "Prajnapana". The difference between the two places is only one word. Where the word "Prajnapana" is used in the Prajnapana Sutra, the word "Rasi" should be used in this place. The rest of the statement is the same in both places. According to the commentary, the brief statement is as follows:

Ruvi Ajivara-rupa, i.e., Pudgala-rasi, is of four types - Skandha, Desa, Pradesh and Paramanu. The entire mass of infinite Paramanus is called Skandha. The part of Skandha that is mixed with it is called Desa, and the indivisible part that is attached to Skandha is called Pradesh. The smallest indivisible part of Pudgala, which is separate, is called Paramanu. Again, this Pudgala is of five types due to the difference in color, smell, taste, touch and form. Again, form is also of many types due to the combination of Pudgala-Paramanus. This Pudgala is also of many types due to the difference in words, bondage, subtle, gross, difference, darkness (darkness), shadow, Udyot (moonlight) and Atap (sunlight), etc.

## 1. In Pancha-stikaya, the nature of Desa and Pradesh is explained differently:

"Skhandham sayala-sammattham, tassa ya a bhananti desotti. Tassa ya addha padesam jam avibhaghi viyan paramanu tti." - Pancha-stikaya, Gatha 95.

These Narakavasa are round inside and square outside, as long as they are Asuabha, and in those Narakas, there are Asuabha Vedanas. Similarly, the description of all seven Prithvis should be given, as per their respective characteristics.

Page #320:
---------------------------
[Diverse Subject Elucidation]
[201st Chapter, It is said that in the time of Kal, Mahakal, Roruk, Maharoruk, and the fifth one called Apratisthan, these are the names of the five great hells. These hells are circular (vatta) and triangular (trayast). The Apratisthan hell in the middle is circular, and the other four hells in the four directions are triangular. The bottom part of these hells is shaped like a khurappa (a type of knife). These hells are inauspicious and contain inauspicious torments.
Seventh Earth: [O Bhagavan! How much area is covered by the hells in the seventh earth?]
Gautam! In the seventh earth, which is one lakh eight thousand yojanas in extent, there are five great hells, called Kal, Mahakal, Roruk, Maharoruk, and the fifth one called Apratisthan, located in the middle three thousand yojanas after descending fifty-two thousand five hundred yojanas from the top and leaving fifty-two thousand five hundred yojanas from the bottom.
586- [O Bhagavan! How many abodes of the Asura Kumaras are there?]
Gautam! In this Ratnapraba earth, which is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas in extent, after descending one thousand yojanas from the top and leaving one thousand yojanas from the bottom, there are sixty-four lakh abodes of the Asura Kumaras in the middle one lakh seventy-eight thousand yojanas. These abodes are circular on the outside, square on the inside, and situated in the shape of a lotus bud. They are surrounded by moats and ditches, which are very deep. Between the moats and ditches, there are palis (walls) built. These abodes are equipped with attalakas (upper stories), charikas (courtyards), doors, gopuras (tower gateways), kapatas (doors), toranas (arches), prati dwaras (gateways), and desha rupa bhagas (regions). They are equipped with yantras (machines), musalas (pestles), bhusundhis (weapons), and shataghnis (weapons). They are invincible against enemy armies. They are made up of forty-eight kothas (rooms) and adorned with forty-eight vanamalas (garlands of trees). Their land and walls are plastered with fine plaster and are smooth. They are decorated with goshirshchandana (sandalwood) and

The walls of these mansions are marked with the imprint of a hand with five fingers, made with a fragrant paste of red sandalwood. Similarly, the staircases of these mansions are also marked with the imprint of a hand with five fingers, made with a paste of sandalwood and red sandalwood. These mansions are filled with the fragrance of burning incense, made with fragrant woods like *kalaaguru*, *kundaru*, and *turushk* (loban). They are magnificent, fragrant, and beautiful. Incense sticks are burning there. These mansions are as pure as the sky, as radiant as crystal, extremely smooth, polished, free from dust, clear, dark-free, pure, radiant, filled with rays, filled with cool light, pleasing to the mind, worth seeing, beautiful, and charming.

Just as the mansions of the Asura-Kumaras have been described, so too should the mansions of the Naga-Kumaras and other celestial beings be described in a similar manner, wherever appropriate. And the mansions described in the verses above should be described in the same way.

## 587
**Question:** How many abodes are there for the earth-bodied beings, O Venerable One?
**Answer:** There are countless abodes for the earth-bodied beings, O Gautama! Similarly, one should know the abodes of the water-bodied beings, up to and including humans.

**Explanation:** The abodes of the womb-born humans are countable, but the abodes of the *sammucchima* humans are not countable. However, it should be known that since there is one being in each body, they are countless.

## 588
**Question:** How many abodes are there for the *vanavyantara* beings, O Venerable One?
**Answer:** O Gautama! On this earth, which is radiant with gems, there is a gem-like *kanda* (core) that is a thousand yojanas thick. Above this *kanda*, for a hundred yojanas, and below it, for a hundred yojanas, there are countless millions of *bhoameyaka* cities, the abodes of the *vanavyantara* gods, in the middle eight hundred yojanas. These *bhoameyaka* cities are round on the outside and square on the inside. Just as the mansions of the *bhavana-vaasi* gods have been described, so too should the mansions of the *vanavyantara* gods be described. The only difference is that these mansions are adorned with flags and garlands. They are beautiful, pleasing to the mind, worth seeing, beautiful, and charming.

## 589
**Question:** How many abodes are there for the *joisiya* beings, O Venerable One?
**Answer:** O Gautama!

[ Diverse Subjects Explained ]
[ 203
In this Ratnaprabha earth, from the very beautiful parts of the earth, going up seven hundred ninety yojanas, in the oblique celestial region of one hundred ten yojanas in width, there are said to be countless celestial mansions of the Jyotishka Devas. These celestial mansions are bright with the effulgence emanating from them and spreading in all directions, adorned with various kinds of gems and jewels, adorned with victorious banners, victory banners, flags, and umbrellas, with high peaks touching the sky, with gems embedded in their lattices. Just as a cage (covering) immediately removes the object with its brilliance, so are they brilliant. They are adorned with stupas of gems and gold, with expanded hundred-petaled lotuses, with tilakas, with crescent-shaped images of gems, very smooth inside and out, with sand-like layers of heated gold, with pleasant touch, beautiful, pleasing to the mind, and worth seeing.
Bhagavan! How many celestial mansions of the Jyotishka Devas are said to be?
Gautama! From this Ratnaprabha earth, from the very beautiful parts of the earth, going up beyond the moon, sun, planets, stars, and constellations, many yojanas, many hundreds of yojanas, many thousands of yojanas [many hundreds of thousands of yojanas], many millions of yojanas, many kotis of yojanas, and countless kotis of yojanas, far up in the sky, in the Saudharma, Ishana, Sanatkumara, Mahendra, Brahma, Lantaka, Shukra, Sahasrar, Anata, Pranata, Aran, Achyuta kalpas, in the Gaiveyakas and Anuttaras, there are eighty-four lakhs, seventy-nine thousand, and twenty-three celestial mansions of the Vaimanika Devas, it is said.

[204]
The Vimanas are radiant like the sun's rays, luminous like masses of light, free from natural impurities (araja), free from acquired impurities (niraja), pure, devoid of darkness, immaculate, filled with rays, radiant, pleasing to the mind, visible, beautiful, and perfect.

[592]
"O Venerable One! How many Vimanas are said to be in the Saudharma Kalpa?"
"Gautama! Thirty-two million Vimanas are said to be in the Saudharma Kalpa. Similarly, in the remaining Kalpas, starting with the Ishana Kalpa, the number of Vimanas decreases progressively as follows: twenty-eight million, twelve million, eight million, four million, fifty thousand, six hundred, four hundred in the Anata Pranat Kalpa, and three hundred in the Aranam-Achyuta Kalpa. (The Vimanas of the Graiveyakas and the Anuttara Devas should also be understood according to the previous verse 7)."

[593]
"O Venerable One! For how long are the Narakas said to be in their state?"
"Gautama! The lowest state is said to be for ten thousand years, and the highest state is said to be for thirty-three Sagaropama."
"O Venerable One! For how long are the Aparjattaka Narakas said to be in their state?"
"Gautama! The lowest state is said to be for an Antarmuhurta, and the highest state is also said to be for an Antarmuhurta."
"The lowest state of the Parjattaka Narakas is for ten thousand years minus an Antarmuhurta, and the highest state is for thirty-three Sagaropama minus an Antarmuhurta. Similarly, from this Ratnapraba Earth to the Mahatamahpraba Earth, the lowest and highest states of the Aparjattaka Narakas are for an Antarmuhurta, and the state of the Parjattaka Narakas is for the normal, lowest, and highest states of that particular Earth minus an Antarmuhurta."

(Similarly, the duration of the states of the Bhavanavasis, Vanavyantaras, Jyotishkas, Kalpavasis, and Graiveyakavasi Devas should be understood...)

[Various Subjects Explained]
[205 According to the Prajnapti Sutra, one should know the sufficient and insufficient time, future, inferior and superior conditions.]
594 - How long is the duration of the gods of the Vijay, Vaijayant, Jayant, and Aparajit vimanas?
Gautama! The inferior condition is said to be thirty-two sagaropama, and the superior condition is said to be thirty-three sagaropama.
All the gods in the Anuttara vimanas, which are called Sarvarthasiddha, are said to have a duration of thirty-three sagaropama, without any distinction between inferior and superior.
- Discussion - In the five Anuttara vimanas, one should know the duration of the gods who are less than an antarmuhurta in the inferior and superior conditions. And one should know the inferior and superior conditions of all the gods in terms of insufficient time, which is an antarmuhurta.
595 - How many bodies are there, Bhagavan?
Gautama! There are five bodies, namely - Audarik, Vaikriya, Aharak, Taijas, and Karman.
596 - How many types of Audarik bodies are there, Bhagavan?
Gautama! There are five types. For example, one-sense Audarik body, up to five-sense Audarik body, which is the human body born from the womb.
597 - What is the extent of the body-absorption of the Audarik body, Bhagavan?
Gautama! The inferior body-absorption is said to be an infinitesimal part of an angula, and the superior body-absorption is said to be a thousand yojanas, which is slightly more than the body-absorption of the Badar plant.

Page #325:
---------------------------
[206]
[Samvayanga Sutra]
Just as the proof of the perception of the Audarika body is stated in the Prajnapana-pada called Avagahana-samsthana, so it should be said here in its entirety. Thus, as long as a human being's superior body-perception is called three Gavyutis (kosas).
598 - How many kinds of Vaikriyika body are there, Bhagavan?
Gautama! The Vaikriyika body is said to be of two kinds - one-sense Vaikriyika body and five-sense Vaikriyika body.
Thus, from the Sanatkumara-kalpa to the Uttara Vimanas, the Vaikriyika Bhavadharaniya body of the Devas is to be said. It decreases by one Rani at a time.
Discussion - The Vaikriyika body is only found in the air-bodied beings among the one-sense beings. It is not found in the विकलेन्द्रिय and सम्मूच्छिम Tiryanchas. It is found in the Narakas, Bhavanavasis, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka Devas, Saudharma Ishana Kalpas, and from the Sanatkumara Kalpa to the Uttara Vimanas. The Bhavadharaniya body of the Narakas is from five hundred Dhanus in the seventh Naraka, decreasing to seven Dhanus, three hands, and six Angulas in the first Naraka. The Bhavadharaniya body of the Bhavanavasis, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka, Saudharma, and Ishana Kalpa Devas is seven Ratnis or hands. The Bhavadharaniya body of the Sanatkumara-Maheindra Devas is six hands. The Bhavadharaniya body of the Brahma-Lantaka Devas is five hands, the Maha-Shukra-Sahasrar Devas is four hands, the Anata-Pranata, Aran-Achyuta Devas is three hands, the Graiveyaka Devas is two hands, and the Uttara Vimanas is one hand. The Tiryanchas who are born from the womb, and the humans who are born from the womb, do not have a Bhavadharaniya Vaikriyika body, but some of them have a Vaikriyika body born from Labdhi-pratyaya. Not all of them. Even among them, it is only found in the Karmabhumij, Sankhyata-Varsha-Ayushk, and Paryaptak beings. Answer - The Vaikriyika body of a human being is about one hundred thousand Yojanas in perception, and that of the Devas is one hundred thousand Yojanas in perception. The Tiryanchas can have a perception of one hundred separate Yojanas at the most.
599 - How many kinds of Aharaya body are there, Bhagavan?
Gautama! It is of one kind.
It is of one kind, whether it is a human Aharaya body or a non-human Aharaya body?
Gautama! It is a human Aharaya body, not a non-human Aharaya body.
If it is a human Aharaya body, is it a गर्भवक्कं Tiryancha Aharaya body, a संमुच्छिम human Aharaya body?
Gautama! It is not a गर्भवक्कं Tiryancha Aharaya body, nor a संमुच्छिम human Aharaya body.
If it is a गर्भवक्कं Tiryancha Aharaya body, is it a Karmabhumig or Akarmabhumig?
Gautama! It is a Karmabhumig, not an Akarmabhumig.

[209 Conclusion - This Aharakaya (food body) belongs to a Pramattasanyata (distractedly restrained) Muni (ascetic) who has attained Siddhi (perfection) and resides in the sixth Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress). In the original text, the reading is 'Vayana Vibhaniyabva', which means, "What is the Aharakaya?" The answers given by Bhagwan Mahavir to the questions asked by Gautam Swami related to this are indicated by a circle (०) after the words 'Kammabhumig.' etc. in the original text. These are the words that are indicated to be spoken, which have been fully translated above.

600 - Aharayasarira Samachauransasanthanasanthiee. This Aharakaya is of a square shape.

Discussion - When a Chaturdasha Purvadhara (fourteen-fold) Apratmattasanyata (perfectly restrained) Muni who has attained Siddhi has a doubt about a deep and subtle principle while in meditation, and there is no Kevali Bhagwan (omniscient being) in that area, then they acquire the Aharakaya karma. As soon as they become Pramattasanyata, a white, human-shaped effigy emerges from their head, devoid of blood, flesh, and bones, with one hand. It goes to where the Kevali Bhagwan resides and touches their feet. As soon as it touches, it returns and enters the head of the Mahamuni, and their doubt is resolved. The acquisition, emergence, and entry of this Aharakaya happens in a single Antarmuhurta (moment). The special feature is that its binding or acquisition happens in the seventh Gunasthan, and its emergence, entry, etc. happen in the sixth Gunasthan.

601 - Aharayasarirass Kemahalia Sarirogahana Pannatta? Goyama! Jahanane Deesuna Rayani, Ukkosena Padipunna Rayani. Bhagwan! How big is the Sarirogahana (body-absorption) of the Aharakaya said to be?

Gautam! The minimum absorption is said to be less than one Ratni (hand), and the maximum absorption is said to be a full Ratni.

602 - Teaasarira Nam Bhante Kativihe Pannatte? Goyama! Panchvihe Pannatte Egi Diya Teyasarira, Vi-Ti-Chaou-Panch ०. Evam Jav ०. Bhagwan! How many types of Tejasasarira (radiant body) are said to be?

Gautam! Five types are said to be - Ekaindriyatayasasarira (one-sense radiant body), Dwiindriyatayasasarira (two-sense radiant body), Triindriyatayasasarira (three-sense radiant body), Chaturindriyatayasasarira (four-sense radiant body), and Panchendriyatayasasarira (five-sense radiant body). In this way, one should know up to Aran-Achyut Kalpa (a period of time).

Discussion - In this Sutra, by mentioning the five types of Tejasasarira in relation to Ekaindriya, etc., it is indicated that the remaining Tejasasarira should be known according to the Prajnapanasutra. According to that, it is given here:

[Bhagwan! How many types of Ekaindriyatayasasarira are said to be?] Gautam! Five types are said to be. For example, Prithvikaaya Ekaindriyatayasasarira (earth-bodied one-sense radiant body), Apkaayik Ekaindriyatayasasarira (water-bodied one-sense radiant body), etc.

[Samvayanga Sutra]
Tejasasarira, Tejaskaayika Ekendiyatejasasarira, Vaayukaayika Ekendiyatejasasarira and Vanaspatikaayika Ekendiyatejasasarira. In the same way, one should know up to the Maranantaik Samudghatagat Avgahana of the Graiveyak Devas.
Here, the Sutrakar has not described the Tejasasarira of the remaining beings, but has indicated the meaning of the Sutra according to the Prarupana formulated in the Prajnapanasutra by the word "Yavat". The intention here is that one should know the Avgahana of the Tejasasarira and the Karmanasarira as much as the Avgahana of the body of the being in its natural state or in a special state like Samudghat, etc. One should know from the Prajnapanasutra which beings of which गति have a low and high physical Avgahana, and which beings assume how many dimensions and extents in the state of Samudghat.
603 - "Bante! How big is the Avgahana of the body of the Graiveyak Deva who has attained the Maranantaik Samudghat, said to be equal to the Samoh?"
"Gotama! The body is said to be of the size of the body, and in terms of Aayam (length), it is said to be as low as the Vidhyadhar श्रेणी, as high as the villages of the Adholoka, and upwards as high as their own Vimanas, and sideways as far as the Manushakhetra. In the same way, one should know that of the Anuttaroppapatik Devas. In the same way, one should describe the Karmanasarira."
Discussion - In this Sutra, the Avgahana of the body of the Graiveyak Deva who has attained the Maranantaik Samudghat is described, and information is given to know the Avgahana of the body of the Anuttar Vimanasasi Devas and the Avgahana of the Karmanasarira. This Sutra is a Madhya Deepak, therefore, one should know the natural Avgahana of the body of all the beings before the Graiveyak Devas of the Tiryanagati from Ekendiy to Panchendriya, and of the Narak, Manusya and Devagati, and the Avgahana in the state of Maranantaik Samudghat, according to the Prajnapanasutra. Here, a brief description is given.
The Avgahana of the Tejas and Karman bodies of the Ekendiy beings like Prithvikaayika, etc., is as much as the low and high Avgahana of their bodies has been described. But in terms of Maranantaik Samudghat or birth after death, the length of the regions of the Ekendiy is from the countless parts of an Angul to the top and bottom of the Lokanta, because the Ekendiy Prithvikaayika, etc., beings can be born in the seventh Prithvi below and in the Ishatpragbhar named Prithvi above after death. The Dwiindriyadi beings can be born after death up to the end of the Tiryanagloka, therefore, the Avgahana of their Tejas-Karman body is...

[211]

The extent of **avagahana** (the range of rebirth) should be known. The **avagahana** of a hell-being is said to be a thousand yojanas, which is more severe than death. This is because a hell-being, upon death, breaks through the wall of the thousand-yojana wide **paatal kalash** (hell) and is reborn as a fish. A hell-being from the seventh hell, upon death, can be reborn as a fish in the **lavan samudra** (salt sea) and above. It can also be reborn as a fish in the **tirchak** (transverse) **svayambhuramna samudra** (self-illuminated ocean) and above in the **pandak vana** (lotus forest) pond. A human being, upon death, can be reborn in all realms up to the **lokanta** (end of the world). Therefore, the **avagahana** of their **taijas** (luminous) and **karman** (karmic) bodies should be known to be that long. The **avagahana** of the **bhavanvaasi** (dwellers in mansions), **vyantar** (intermediate), **jyotishi** (astronomers), and **soudharma** (heavenly beings of the **ishan** kalpa) is said to be an infinitesimal part of an angul (finger). This is because these deities, upon death, can be reborn as one-sensed earth-bodied beings in their own **vimanas** (celestial vehicles). Their **avagahana** should be known to extend downwards to the third earth, transversely to the outer **vedika** (platform) of the **svayambhuramna samudra**, and upwards to the end of the **ishtapraagbaar** (slightly forward) earth. The **avagahana** of the **taijas** and **karman** bodies of the deities from the **sanatkumar** kalpa to the **sahasrar** kalpa is said to be an infinitesimal part of an angul. This is because these deities, upon death while bathing in the ponds of the **pandak vana** and other places, are reborn as fish there. Their **avagahana** should be known to extend downwards to the second third of the **mahapaatal kalash** (great hell). This is because they can be reborn as fish there due to the presence of water. Their **avagahana** should be known to extend transversely to the end of the **svayambhuramna samudra**. Their **avagahana** is said to extend upwards to the **achyut** heaven. This is because the deities of the **sanatkumar** and other heavens can go to the **achyut** heaven with the help of a **sangatik** (companion) deity and, upon the completion of their lifespan, can die there and be reborn in the **madhyaloka** (middle world). The **avagahana** of the deities of the **anant** and other four heavens is said to be an infinitesimal part of an angul. This is because if a deity from there comes to the **madhyaloka** and dies here, they can be reborn in the womb of a human woman here. The **avagahana** of the aforementioned deities should be known to extend downwards to the human realm. This is because the deities of the last four heavens are reborn as humans upon death. The **avagahana** of the **graiveyak** (heavenly beings who carry burdens) and **anuttarvimanovaasi** (dwellers in the highest celestial vehicles) deities should be known to extend to the **vidyadhar** (celestial beings) range of the **vijayardha** mountain. Their **avagahana** is said to extend downwards to the villages of the **adholoka** (lower world), transversely to the human realm, and upwards to their own **vimanas**.

605 - "How many types of **avadhijnana** (knowledge of the range of rebirth) are there, sir?"

"There are two types of **avadhijnana** - **bhavapacchai** (knowledge of the cycle of birth and death) and **kshayopasamik** (knowledge of the cessation of karma). This is how the entire **avadhijnana** section of the **Prajnapanasutra** should be understood."

**Discussion** - The **avadhijnana** that the sutrakar (author of the sutra) has instructed us to know is as follows: **avadhijnana** is described through ten doors: its types, subject, location, internal, external, **deshavadhi** (knowledge of the range of space), growth, decline, **pratipati** (acceptance), and **apratipati** (non-acceptance). The sutrakar has mentioned two types of **avadhijnana**. Of these, **bhavapacchai avadhijnana** is experienced by deities and hell-beings, while **kshayopasamik** - **gunapacchai avadhijnana** (knowledge of the cessation of karma) is experienced by humans and animals.

**The subject of Avadhijnana (clairvoyance) is of four types according to Dravya (substance), Kshetra (space), Kala (time) and Bhava (state).**

**In terms of Dravya, Avadhijnana perceives the Dravyas between the Tejasvargana (luminary) and the Bhashavargana (speech) in a lesser degree, and all Dravyas in a greater degree.**

**In terms of Kshetra, it perceives a space as small as an infinitesimal part of an angula (finger) in a lesser degree, and a space as large as countless divisions of the Lokapramāna (universe) in a greater degree.**

**In terms of Kala, it perceives the past and future as small as an infinitesimal part of an Aavali (a unit of time) in a lesser degree, and the past and future as large as countless Utsarpini (ascending) periods in a greater degree.**

**In terms of Bhava, it perceives the four ganas (groups) of each Pudgala Dravya (atomic substance) in a lesser degree, and countless qualities of each Rupa Dravya (form substance) and infinite qualities of all Rupa Dravyas in a greater degree.**

**In terms of the institution, the size of Avadhijnana of Narakas (hell beings) is like a Tapra (a small boat), that of Bhavanavasi Devas (heavenly beings residing in mansions) is like a Paly (a type of musical instrument), that of Vyantar Devas (intermediate heavenly beings) is like a Patha (a type of musical instrument), that of Jyotishka Devas (celestial beings) is like a Jhala (a type of ornament), that of Kalpopanna Devas (heavenly beings born in a Kalpa) is like a Mridanga (a type of drum), that of Graiveyak Devas (heavenly beings who are the guardians of the world) is like a Changri (a type of musical instrument) with a flower-decorated peak, and that of Anuttar Devas (highest heavenly beings) is like a Kanyacholaka (a type of garment). The size of Avadhijnana of Tiryanchas (animals) and Manusyas (humans) is of various types.**

**In terms of the inner door, it is considered which beings reside within the area illuminated by their Avadhijnana.**

**In terms of the outer door, it is considered which beings reside outside the area illuminated by their Avadhijnana. For example, Narakas, Devas and Tirthankaras are within the area illuminated by their Avadhijnana. The remaining beings are both external and internal Avadhijnana holders.**

**In terms of the Deshavadhi door, Devas, Narakas and Tiryanchas have only Deshavadhijnana (knowledge of a particular region), because they know only a part of the Dravyas that are the subject of Avadhijnana. But Manusyas have both Deshavadhi and Sarvavadhi (knowledge of all regions). It is important to note here that Sarvavadhijnana is only possessed by the Tadbhava (those who have attained liberation) and the Paramasanyata (perfectly restrained), not by others.**

**In terms of the Vridhi-Hani (increase-decrease) door, the Avadhijnana of Manusyas and Tiryanchas increases during the time of purification of their karmas (actions) and decreases during the time of their defilement. The Avadhijnana in the form of increase grows from an infinitesimal part of an angula to the extent of the Lokakasha (space of the universe). Similarly, it decreases progressively as defilement increases. But the Avadhijnana of Devas and Narakas remains constant at the level at which it is generated, it does not increase or decrease.**

**In terms of the Pratipati-Apratipati (manifest-unmanifest) door, Deshavadhijnana is Pratipati (manifest) and Sarvavadhijnana is Apratipati (unmanifest). The Bhavapratyay (karma-related) Avadhijnana is Apratipati until the end of the Bhava (cycle of birth and death) and becomes Pratipati after the Bhava is ended. The Kshayopaśamika (destruction of karmas) Gunapratyay (quality-related) Avadhijnana is both Pratipati and Apratipati.**

[213 605 - The object of pain should be known through these doors: cold, substance, body, state, suffering, assumption, approach, sleep, and wakefulness. ||1||
606 - Venerable sir! Do the hell beings experience cold pain, hot pain, or both cold and hot pain?
Gautama! The hell beings experience cold pain, thus the word pain should be said.
Discussion - The object of pain should be known through these doors: cold, etc. The word 'c' read before the word 'cold' in the original text does not indicate the opposite pains. Accordingly, there are three types of pain - cold pain, hot pain, and both cold and hot pain. The hell beings of the lower earths experience only cold pain, and the hell beings of the upper earths experience only hot pain. The living beings of the remaining three realms experience cold pain, hot pain, and both cold and hot pain.
The word 'substance' indicates the field, time, and feeling along with the word substance. That is, there are four types of pain - substance pain - which is experienced in relation to the substance of matter, field pain - which is experienced in relation to the field of hell, etc., time pain - which is experienced in relation to the life-time of hell, etc., and is experienced for a fixed period of time. The pain experienced from the arising of karmic pain is called feeling pain. From hell beings to the celestial beings of the Vaimānika realm, all living beings experience all four types of pain.
With respect to the door of 'body', pain is said to be of three types - bodily, mental, and both bodily and mental. Some pain is only bodily, some is only mental, and some is related to both. All sentient five-sense beings of the four realms experience all three types of pain. But beings from one-sense to non-sentient five-sense beings experience only bodily pain.
With respect to the door of 'state', pain is of three types - state pain, non-state pain, and both state and non-state pain. All worldly beings experience all three types of pain.
The word 'suffering' indicates three types of pain - pleasant pain, unpleasant pain, and both pleasant and unpleasant pain. All beings of the four realms experience all three types of pain.
Question - What is the difference between the pain mentioned in the previous door and the pleasant-unpleasant pain mentioned in this door?
Answer - State-non-state pains occur when state-non-state karmic pain arises. But...

---------------------------
## Translation:

**214]**
[Samvayanga Sutra]  Suffering and pleasure sensations are caused by the stimulation of karmic matter by others. Therefore, there is a difference between their arising and stimulation.
The sensation that is self-accepted is called *abhyupgamiki* sensation. For example, self-inflicted hair plucking, taking heat, fasting, etc.
The sensation that is experienced when karmic matter arises on its own or is obtained through stimulation is called *aupkrami* sensation. Both these sensations are experienced by the five-sensed, the animal, and the human. But the gods, the hell-beings, and the one-sensed to the non-conscious five-sensed beings experience only *aupkrami* sensation.
The sensation experienced consciously and willingly is called *nida* sensation, and the sensation experienced unconsciously or unwillingly is called *anida* sensation. Conscious beings experience both types of sensations. But non-conscious beings experience only *anida* sensation.
One should study the thirty-fifth *vedana* chapter of the *Prajnapanasutra* on this subject.

**607-**  "How many *leshya* are there, Master?" "Gautama! There are six *leshya*, namely, *krishna* *leshya*, *nila* *leshya*, *kapota* *leshya*, *tejala* *leshya*, *padma* *leshya*, and *shukla* *leshya*. Thus, the term *leshya* should be used."
**Discussion:** At this point, the Sanskrit commentator has indicated the need to know the seventeenth *leshya* chapter of the *Prajnapanasutra*. Due to its extensive nature, it has not been discussed here.

**608-**  "The *anantara* *ahari*, *abhoga* *ahari*, *anabhoga* *ahari*, those who do not know and see the *ahari* *pudgala*, and those who know and see them, etc., are to be known as fourfold, praiseworthy-unpraiseworthy, with determination and without determination, and those who have attained rightness and wrongness." [1]
**Discussion:** The act of taking in the *pudgala* suitable for the body, as soon as it is born in the *upapata* field, is called *anantara* *ahari*. All beings, as soon as they are born, take in the *pudgala* suitable for their body. Taking in food consciously is called *abhoga* *nirvartita*, and taking in food unconsciously is called *anabhoga* *nirvartita*. Hell-beings take in both types of food. Similarly, all beings should be known. Only one-sensed beings take in *anabhoga* *nirvartita* food. The hell-beings do not know or see the *pudgala* that they take in as food, through their *avadhi* knowledge. Similarly, the *asura* to the three-sensed beings do not know or see the *ahari* *pudgala* that they have taken in. The four-sensed beings have eyes...

[Even though they are 215 (in the state of being a liberated soul), they do not see or know because they are knowledgeable of death. The five-sensed animals and humans who are clairvoyant know and see the food-karmic particles. The remaining beings know the projected food, but they do not know or see the hair-food. The inner and luminous gods do not know or see the food-karmic particles they have consumed. Among the aerial gods, those who have right vision know and see the food-karmic particles through their specific knowledge, but the aerial gods who have wrong vision do not know or see them.
In comparison to the door of final liberation, the places of dwelling for the hellish beings and others are countless, both spacious and cramped.
In comparison to the door of right and wrong vision, all beings from the one-sensed to the non-conscious five-sensed are wrong-visioned. Among the remaining beings, some are right-visioned, some are wrong-visioned, and some are both right and wrong-visioned.
The Sutra-maker has given information about all this from verse number one.
609- "Venerable sir! Are the hellish beings infinite-food eaters? (At the very first moment of their birth in the realm of suffering, do they consume the karmic particles suitable for their body?) After that, do they perform the act of becoming (the formation of the body)? After that, do they perform the act of assimilation (the consumption of karmic particles suitable for their limbs and organs)? After that, do they perform the act of transformation (the consumption of the consumed karmic particles as objects of sound, etc.)? After that, do they perform the act of service (maintenance)? And after that, do they perform the act of diversification (various types of reactions)? (Is this true?)"
"Yes, Gautama! It is so. (This statement is true.) Here (as stated in the Prajnapanasutra), the word 'food' should be used."
610- "Venerable sir! How many types of bondage of the lifespan karma are stated?"
"Gautama! The bondage of lifespan karma is stated to be of six types, such as- the lifespan karma of the type of birth, the lifespan karma of the type of motion, the lifespan karma of the type of position, the lifespan karma of the type of region, the lifespan karma of the type of portion, and the lifespan karma of the type of immersion."

Every being, at the time of binding the lifespan of the future birth, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of birth suitable for that motion, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of motion, and in the same way, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of position, region, portion, and immersion (body karma) suitable for it. For example, a being who is about to be born in the hell realm, at the time of binding the lifespan of that birth, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of birth suitable for that hell realm, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of motion suitable for that hell realm, and in the same way, also binds the lifespan karma of the type of position, region, portion, and immersion (body karma) suitable for that hell realm.

## Translation:

**216]**
When the lifespan karma is being bound, at the same time, the five-sense-category karma is also being bound, the heavenly-realm karma is also being bound, the fixed-time-duration of the lifespan is also being bound, and the fixed-quantity karma-regions are also being bound, the fixed-taste-resultant-section, which gives intense or mild fruits, is also being bound, and the body, which is the active-immersion in the heavenly realm, is also being bound. From all these aspects, the lifespan karma is said to be of six types.

**611]**
**Venerable one! How many types of lifespan-binding are stated for the hell-beings?**
**Gautama!** Six types are stated, such as:
- **Category-name-lifespan**
- **Realm-name-lifespan**
- **Duration-name-lifespan**
- **Region-name-lifespan**
- **Section-name-lifespan**
- **Immersion-name-lifespan**
Similarly, from the Asura-Kumaras to the Vaimanika Devas, in all the punishment-receivers, one should know six types of lifespan-binding.

**612]**
**Venerable one! After how much time-gap is the rebirth of the hell-beings stated?**
**Gautama!** For the lowest, one time-period, and for the highest, twelve Muhurtas.

**Explanation:** The time period until the birth of any being in the desired realm is called the time-gap or interval. If a being is not born in hell, then it will not be born for at least one time-period. This is the lowest time-gap. At the most, a being will not be born in hell for twelve Muhurtas, this is the highest time-gap. (After twelve Muhurtas, some being or the other is born in hell.)

**613]**
Similarly, the lowest and highest time-gaps for the animal realm, human realm, and heavenly realm should also be known.

**Explanation:** The highest time-gap or interval of twelve Muhurtas mentioned above is a general statement. According to the specific statement in the scriptures, the time-gap for the hell-beings in all the seven earths of hell is different. As is clear from the following verse quoted in the commentary:

**Twenty-four Muhurtas, seven days, then fifteen. A month, then two, then four, six months is the time-gap.**

**Meaning:** The highest time-gap is twenty-four Muhurtas in the first earth, seven days in the second, fifteen days in the third, one month in the fourth, two months in the fifth, four months in the sixth, and six months in the seventh earth.

[217] In the same way, the excellent period of separation for all those who dwell in houses is twenty-four muhurtas. The birth of the five stationary beings, starting with the earth-bodied, is continuous, therefore they do not have a period of separation. The period of separation for the two-sensed beings is an antarmuhurta. Similarly, the period of separation for the three-sensed, four-sensed, and the complete five-sensed Tiryanchas is also an antarmuhurta. The period of separation for the womb-born Tiryanchas and humans is twelve muhurtas. The period of separation for the complete humans is twenty-four muhurtas. The period of separation for the gods of the Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Saudharma-Ishana kalpas is also twenty-four muhurtas. The period of separation for the gods in the Sanatkumara kalpa is nine days and twenty muhurtas. The period of separation for the gods in the Mahendra kalpa is twelve days and ten muhurtas. The period of separation for the gods in the Brahmaloka is twenty-two and a half nights and days. The period of separation for the gods in the Lantkaka kalpa is forty-five days and nights, that is, one and a half months. The period of separation for the gods in the Mahashukra kalpa is eighty days (two months and twenty days). The period of separation for the gods in the Sahasraraka kalpa is one hundred days (three months and ten days). The period of separation for the gods in the Anata-Pranata kalpa is a countable number of months. The period of separation for the gods in the Aran-Achyuta kalpa is a countable number of years. In the lower three Graiveyakas, the period of separation is a countable number of hundred years. In the middle three Graiveyakas, the period of separation is a countable number of thousand years. In the upper three Graiveyakas, the period of separation is a countable number of hundred thousand (lakh) years. In the four Uttara Vimanas, starting with Vijaya, the period of separation is an uncountable number of years, and in the Sarvarthasiddha Uttara Vimana, the period of separation is an uncountable number of parts of a palya.

- 614 - "O Bhagavan! For how long does the Siddhagati remain devoid of attainment? "
"Gautama! From the lowest, it takes one moment, and from the highest, it takes six months for someone to attain Siddhi. This is the duration of the separation from the Siddhi."
"In the same way, one should also know the period of separation for the death (udvartana) of all other beings except the Siddhagati."
"Explanation - Except for the desired state, the exit from it is called udvartana. The beings who attain the Siddhagati never leave from there, therefore their udvartana is prohibited. The beings from the remaining four states leave after completing their respective lifespans and take on a new Paryaya, therefore their udvartana is mentioned in the Agam. One should know it from the Agam."

- 615 - "O Bhagavan! For how long does the period of separation for the Narakas of this Ratnaprabha earth remain before they are called those who have attained the Uppaata?"
"In response to the above question, one should mention the Uppaata-Dandaka (as mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra). Similarly, one should also mention the Udvartana-Dandaka."
"Explanation - The Uppaata-Dandaka, which the Sutra has instructed to know, is as follows..."

## Samvayanga Sutra, Ratnaprabha

**218]**

The duration of the *upapat* (birth) of the hell beings of the *Ratnaprabha* earth is from one *muhurt* (48 minutes) at the lowest to twenty-four *muhurt* at the highest. The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Sharkara* earth is seven nights and days. The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Valuka* earth is half a month (15 nights and days). The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Pankaprabha* earth is one month. The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Dhumaprabha* earth is two months. The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Tamahprabha* earth is four months. The highest *upapat* duration of the hell beings of the *Mahatamahprabha* earth is six months.

The highest *upapat* duration of the *Asura Kumaras* is twenty-four *muhurt*. Similarly, one should know the *upapat* duration of all the other *bhavanavasis* (dwellers of the abodes). The *upapat* duration of the five *ekendriya* (one-sensed) beings, starting with the *prithivicayika*, is not applicable, as they are constantly being born. The *upapat* duration of the *dwiendriya* (two-sensed) beings is one *antarmuhurt* (half a *muhurt*). Similarly, one should know the *upapat* duration of the *triendriya* (three-sensed), *chaturindriya* (four-sensed), and *sammuchchhim* (fully developed) *panchendriya* (five-sensed) *tiryanch* (animals). The *upapat* duration of the *garbhopakrantik* (embryonic) humans is twelve *muhurt*. The *upapat* duration of the *sammuchchhim* humans is twenty-four *muhurt*. The *upapat* duration of the *vyantar*, *jyotishk*, and *soudharm* - *ishankalp* gods is also twenty-four *muhurt* each. The *upapat* duration of the *Sanatkumar* gods is nine days and twenty *muhurt*. The *upapat* duration of the *Mahendra* gods is twelve days and ten *muhurt*. The *upapat* duration of the gods of the *Brahmaloka* is twenty-two and a half days and nights. The *upapat* duration of the *Lantaka* gods is forty-five nights and days. The *upapat* duration of the *Mahashukra* gods is eighty days. The *upapat* duration of the *Sahasrar* gods is one hundred days. The *upapat* duration of the *Anat* gods is a countable number of months. Similarly, one should know the *upapat* duration of the *Pranat* gods. The *upapat* duration of the *Aran* and *Achyut* gods is a countable number of years. The *upapat* duration of the gods of the *Adhastan Graiveyakatrik* is a countable number of hundred years. The *upapat* duration of the gods of the *Madhyam Graiveyakatrik* is a countable number of thousand years. The *upapat* duration of the gods of the *Uparitan Graiveyakatrik* is a countable number of hundred thousand years. The *upapat* duration of the gods of the four *anuttar* (highest) *vimanas* (celestial chariots), starting with *Vijaya*, is an uncountable number of years. The *upapat* duration of the *Sarvarthasiddha* gods is an uncountable fraction of a *palya* (a measure of time). This is the duration of the *upapat* (birth).

The act of leaving a particular hell, heaven, etc., i.e., leaving that *paryaya* (state) and taking birth in another *paryaya* is called *udvartana* (transmigration). The duration of the *udvartana* is the same as the duration of the *upapat* mentioned for each *gati* (state of existence).

**Knowing the Attraction of Ayubandha in All Dandakas Up to Vaimanika Kalpa**

**Explanation:** Generally, the meaning of attraction is the reception of karma pudgalas. But here, the opportunities for binding the age of the upcoming birth of a living being are called attraction times. This attraction depends on the intensity and slowness of the living being's efforts. If the efforts are intense, the living being receives the age divisions in one go. If the efforts are slow, then the age is bound by two attractions, if slower, then by three, and if the efforts are slowest, then the age is bound by four, five, six, seven, or eight attractions. There are never more attractions than this.

**617 - "How many types of Sanhanan are there, O Bhagavan?"**

**"Gautama! There are six types of Sanhanan, as follows: 1. Vajrarṣabhanāracasanhanan, 2. Ṛṣabhanāracasanhanan, 3. Nāracasanhanan, 4. Ardha-nāracasanhanan, 5. Kīlikāsanhanan, and 6. Sevārtasanhanan."**

**Explanation:** The specific binding of bones within the body is called Sanhanan. Its six types are mentioned in the presented sutra. Vajra means nail, Ṛṣabha means strap, and the bone on both sides of the body is called Nāraca. The body whose two lateral bones are bound by a strap and have a nail in the middle is called Vajrarṣabhanāracasanhanan. The body whose bones do not have a nail but whose two lateral bones are bound by a strap is called Ṛṣabhanāracasanhanan. The body whose bones do not have a strap is called Nāracasanhanan. The body whose bones are only bound by Mṛga on one side and not on the other is called Ardha-nāracasanhanan. The body whose bones only have a nail is called Kīlikāsanhanan. The body whose bones are joined together and covered with skin is called Sevārtasanhanan. Devas and Naraki beings do not have bones in their bodies, therefore, their Sanhanan is said to be absent. Humans and Tiryanch Panchendriya beings have all six Sanhanans. The Sanhanans of the remaining Tiryanch beings, starting with Ekendriya, are described in the following sutra.

**618 - "O Bhagavan! Which Sanhanan are Narakas said to have?"**

**"Gautama! Narakas do not have any of the six Sanhanans. They are Asanhanani because they do not have bones, veins (arteries), or nerves (intestines). The pudgalas that are there are anista, akānta, apriya, anādeya, asubha, amanojña, amanāma, and amanobhirāma, and from these, the body of Narakas is formed without Sanhanan."**

**"Bante! What kind of saṃhanana are Asura Kumaras said to have?"**
**"Gotama! Asura Kumaras have no saṃhanana. They are asanhaṇīya (incapable of being held together) because they have no bones, no veins, and no tendons. Those who are iṣṭa (desirable), kānta (attractive), priya (dear), ādeya (worthy of being received), subha (auspicious), manojña (pleasing to the mind), manama (pleasing to the heart), and manobhirāma (pleasing to the soul) have their bodies formed in such a way that they are asanhaṇīya. This is the same for all the Kumaras, from Naga Kumaras to Sthanita Kumaras."**

**"Bante! What kind of saṃhanana are Pṛthivīkāyika beings said to have?"**

Garbhopakrantiya Tiryanch have all six types of saṃhanana. Sammūchhima humans have sevarta saṃhanana. Garbhopakrantiya humans have all six types of saṃhanana.

**Explanation:** The shape of the body is called saṃsthāna. A body whose limbs and appendages are free from any deficiency or excess, and are in accordance with the prescribed standards of the scriptures, is called Samachaturasra saṃsthāna. A body in which the parts above the navel are in accordance with the standards of anatomy, but the parts below the navel are deficient, is called Nyagrodha saṃsthāna.

The term "Kubjakasansthan" refers to a body where all the limbs are in accordance with the principles of anatomy, but the body is dwarfed. The term "Hundsansthan" refers to a body where all the limbs, such as hands and feet, are opposite to the principles of anatomy.

[229 Discussion - The tree under which the Tirthankaras attained omniscience is called the Chaitya tree.

Kubera establishes the same tree at the place where the Tirthankara sits in the Samavasarana and adorns it with flags, banners, platforms and toranas. All these banyan, sal, etc. trees located in the Samavasarana are called 'Ashoka trees' because as soon as a creature reaches their shade, his sorrow is removed and he becomes Ashoka (free from sorrow). 648 - There were twenty-four first disciples of these twenty-four Tirthankaras.

Thus, in this Jambudvipa, in this Bharatavarsha, in this Avasarpini Kal, there have been nine Dasaramandala (communities of Baldeva and Vasudeva). The Sutrakar describes them:

All these Baldeva and Vasudeva were great men born into noble families. They were middle men because they were intermediaries between the Tirthankaras and the other Shala-purushas. Or, they were middle men because they were stronger than ordinary people but weaker than the Tirthankaras. They were the leading men of their time because they possessed the most prominent qualities of courage, etc. They were powerful because they were endowed with mental strength. They were radiant because they possessed luminous bodies. They were dominant because they were endowed with physical strength. They were famous because they achieved fame through their valor. They were shadowy because they possessed a shadow (aura) around their bodies. They were radiant because they possessed a radiant glow. They were gentle because they possessed a moon-like countenance. They were fortunate because they were beloved by all. They were pleasing to the eyes because they were very pleasing to look at. They were handsome because they possessed a square body. They were virtuous because they possessed a good character. They were easily accessible because everyone could easily meet them. They were beloved by all because they were pleasing to the eyes of all. They were powerful because they were strong, tireless, and possessed an uninterrupted flow of strength. They were very powerful because they surpassed the strength of all the men of their time. They were supremely powerful because they possessed great and excellent strength. They were unharmed because they possessed an uninterrupted lifespan, or because no one could defeat them in a wrestling match. They were unconquerable because no one could defeat them in battle. They were crushers of enemies because they crushed their enemies in great battles. They were destroyers of thousands of enemies because they destroyed the pride of thousands of enemies. They were benevolent to those who obeyed or served them, but they were cruel to those who betrayed them. They were free from envy because they were grateful for even the smallest of qualities in others. They were steadfast because they possessed a stable mind, speech, and body. They were unwavering because they were free from fickleness. They were fierce without any reason.

[Past and Future Great Personalities]
[233] They were devoid of anger, possessed a gentle, melodious voice and a soft smile. They spoke profound, sweet and truthful words. They had a loving attitude towards those who submitted to them. They were protectors of those who sought refuge. They were adorned with auspicious marks like vajra, swastika, chakra, etc., and had the qualities of moles, freckles, etc. They were endowed with the perfect height, weight and proportion of their body, and were born with a beautiful body. They had a gentle, moon-like face, were radiant and pleasing to behold. They were 'Amasruna', meaning they were not lazy in performing their duties, or 'Amarshana', meaning they were forgiving even to those who wronged them. They were the upholders of severe punishment for the wicked. They were dignified and impressive. Baldev was the bearer of a flag with the mark of a Tal tree, and Vasudev was the bearer of a flag with the mark of Garuda. They were capable of drawing great bows that spanned from ear to ear, and were oceans of great strength. It was impossible to withstand their attacks on the battlefield. They were wielders of great bows, heroes among men, men who had earned fame in battles, born into great families, and could crush even a diamond with their thumb and forefinger. They were the rulers of half the Bharat region, i.e., three continents. They were gentle in nature. They were the ornaments of royal families and dynasties. They were 'Ajit' (unconquerable) and 'Ajitarath' (possessing an invincible chariot). Baldev was the wielder of the plough and the mace, while Vasudev was the wielder of the Sharanga bow, Panchjanya conch, Sudarshana chakra, Kaumodaki mace, Shakti and Nandaka sword. They wore a crown adorned with the excellent, brilliant, radiant, pure Kaustubha gem. Their faces were illuminated by the light of the gems in their earrings. They had lotus-like eyes. A garland of pearls adorned their neck and chest. Their chest was marked with the auspicious Srivatsa mark. They were renowned for their glory throughout the world. Their chest was always adorned with a long, beautiful, radiant, blooming, five-colored garland made of fragrant flowers that bloomed in all seasons. Their beautiful limbs were endowed with one hundred and eight auspicious marks. They moved with grace, vigor and elegance like a maddened elephant. They had a sweet, deep voice like the newly risen clouds of autumn, like the silent cry of the crane and like the sound of the drum. Baldev wore a blue silk garment with a waist-band, while Vasudev wore a yellow silk garment with a waist-band. They were endowed with great brilliance and radiance. Being extremely powerful, they were known as Narasimha (like a lion among men), Narapati (husband of men), Narendara (supremely powerful) and Naravrishabha (the best among men). By fully performing their duties, they were worthy of the title of Marudvrishabha, like the king of gods. They were more radiant than other kings and emperors with the radiance of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. Thus, the nine blue-clad Ramas (Baldev) and the nine yellow-clad Keshavas (Vasudev) were both brothers. 1. If the water that spills out of a boat filled with water is equal to one 'dron' (a unit of measurement), then that man is called 'Man-prapta'. If the weight of a man sitting on a scale is equal to half a 'bhar' (a unit of weight), then he is called 'Unman-prapta'. If the height of a body is one hundred and eight angulas (finger widths) from his fingertip, then he is called 'Praman-prapta'.

Again, 10. Siddharth, 11. Poorna-ghosh, 12. Maha-ghosh Kevali, and 13. Satya-sen will be Arhants. [91]
After that, 14. Soor-sen Arhant, 15. Maha-sen Kevali, 16. Sarva-anand, and 17. Dev-putra Arhant will be. [92]
After that, 18. Supaarshva, 19. Suvrat Arhant, 20. Sukoshal Arhant, and 21. Anant-vijay Arhant will be in the upcoming time. [93]
After that, 22. Vimala Arhant, after him 23. Maha-bal Arhant, and then 24. Deva-anand Arhant will be in the upcoming time. [94]
These above-mentioned twenty-four Tirthankara Kevalis will be the ones who preach Dharma-tirth in the Airavata region during the upcoming Utsarpini Kal. [95]

There will be nine enemies of theirs, nine names of their previous births, nine Dharma-acharyas, nine Nidana-bhumis, and nine causes of Nidana. In the same way, in the upcoming Utsarpini Kal, in the Airavata region, the liberation-journey, arrival from heaven, birth among humans, and liberation of Baldeva, etc., should be narrated.
676 - In the same way, in the upcoming Utsarpini Kal, in both the Bharat and Airavata regions, the narration of Vasudeva, etc., should be done.

[241 677-This is how it is. Just as there are lineages of householders, so too are there lineages of Tirthankaras, lineages of Chakravartis, lineages of Dasaras, lineages of Ganadharas, lineages of Rishis, lineages of Yatīs, and lineages of Munis. It is called a "Su" or "Suanga" or "Suyasa" or "Suyakhanda" or "Samavaya" or "Sankhya" because it is a complete and perfect study of all the angas.
_ This Samavayanga Sutra is said to describe many kinds of emotions and objects. For example, it describes the lineages of householders. Similarly, it describes the lineages of Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Dasaras, Ganadharas, Rishis, Yatīs, and Munis. It is called "Shruta" because it gives knowledge of all things in the three times indirectly. It is called "Shrutaanga" because it is a part of the Shruta, the discourse of the enlightened one. It is called "Shruta-samasa" because it summarizes the meaning of all the Sutras. It is called "Shruta-skandha" because it describes the collection of the Shruta. It is also called "Sankhya" because it describes the collection of all beings and objects. It is called "Samasta" or "complete" because it is a complete anga, unlike the other angas like Acharanga, which have divisions like Shruta-skandha. It is also called "Adhyayana" because it does not have divisions like Uddesa. Thus, Shri Sudharma Swami Jambuswami says, addressing Bhagavan Mahavira, "I have told you this anga just as I heard it from Bhagavan Mahavira."
Discussion- The lineages of Tirthankaras, etc., mentioned in this Sutra refer to their traditions. The words Rishi, Yati, etc., generally refer to ascetics, but those who possess supernatural powers are called Rishis, those who ascend to the stage of Upshama or Kshapaka are called Yatīs, those who have knowledge of Avadhi and Manahparyaya are called Munis, and those who are ordinary ascetics who have renounced their homes are called Anagaras. In the Sanskrit commentary, all the disciples of Jinendra except the Ganadharas are called Rishis. According to etymology, one who removes karmic afflictions is called a Rishi, one who is knowledgeable in the science of the self is called a Muni, one who strives to destroy sins is called a Yati, and one who is free from desire even in the body is called an Anagara.
Although this Samavayanga is the fourth of the twelve angas, it describes all the angas in brief, hence its importance is particularly emphasized.
||Samavayanga Sutra ends||
The wise are called Rishis because they are a collection of afflictions. The Muni is praised by the great because of the validity of his knowledge of the self. ||829|| He who strives to destroy the bonds of sin becomes a Yati. He who is free from desire even in the body is considered an Anagara by the virtuous. ||830|| -[Yasastilakacampu]

## Chapter 251: Unfavorable Times for Study [Excerpted from the Nandi Sutra, edited by Acharya Atmaramji Maharaj]

One should study scriptures only during the times prescribed in the Agamas for study. Studying during unfavorable times is prohibited.

The Manusmriti and other Smritis also describe unfavorable times in detail. Vedic people also mention unfavorable times for studying the Vedas. Similarly, other ancient texts are also considered to have unfavorable times. Jain Agamas, being the word of the omniscient, divinely inspired, and self-illuminating, also have unfavorable times mentioned in them, such as:

**Ten unfavorable times related to the sky:**

1. **Ukkavate (Meteor Shower):** If there is a large meteor shower, one should not study for one prahar.
2. **Disidadhe (Fiery Sky):** When the sky appears red, as if on fire, one should not study.

##  Translation:

**[252]**

**9.  Dhumika-Krishna:** A fine mist of water particles, appearing dark in color, is called Dhumika-Krishna.  As long as this mist persists, one should not engage in self-study.

**9.  Mihika-Shweta:** In the winter, a fine mist of water particles, appearing white in color, is called Mihika. As long as this mist falls, it is a time for non-study.

**10.  Raj Udghāt:** Due to wind, dust spreads throughout the sky. As long as this dust remains, one should not engage in self-study.

The above ten reasons are related to the sky and are considered times for non-study. The following ten reasons are related to the material world and are also considered times for non-study.

**11-12-13.  Bones, Flesh, and Blood:** If the bones, flesh, and blood of a five-sensed non-human being are visible, then one should not engage in self-study until these objects are removed.  The commentator considers a radius of 60 cubits around these objects as a time for non-study.

Similarly, the bones, flesh, and blood of a human being are also considered a time for non-study. The difference is that the non-study period for these objects extends to 100 cubits and lasts for one day and night.  For a woman's menstrual cycle, the non-study period is three days. For the birth of a boy and a girl, the non-study period is seven and eight days respectively.

**14.  Ashchi-Mal-Mūtra:** As long as excrement and urine are visible, it is a time for non-study.

**15.  Shmashān:** A radius of 100 cubits around a cremation ground is considered a time for non-study.

**16.  Chandragrahaṇa:** During a lunar eclipse, one should not engage in self-study for eight, twelve, or sixteen praharas, depending on the severity of the eclipse (least, moderate, and most severe respectively).

**17.  Sūryagrahaṇa:** During a solar eclipse, one should also not engage in self-study for eight, twelve, or sixteen praharas, depending on the severity of the eclipse (least, moderate, and most severe respectively).

**18.  Patan:** Upon the death of a great king or a prominent person, one should not engage in self-study until their cremation is completed. Alternatively, one should gradually resume self-study after a new authority takes over.

**19.  Rājavyuḍgraha:** When neighboring kings engage in war, one should not engage in self-study until peace is restored. Even after peace is restored, one should not engage in self-study for one day and night.

**20.  Audārika Sharīra:** If a five-sensed being dies within the shelter, one should not engage in self-study until the body is removed. If the lifeless body remains within a radius of 100 cubits, one should not engage in self-study.

The above ten reasons are related to the material body and are considered times for non-study.

**21-28.  Four Mahotsava and Four Mahāpratipadā:** The four Mahotsava are: Āṣāḍha Pūrṇimā, Āśvina Pūrṇimā, Kārttika Pūrṇimā, and Chaitra Pūrṇimā. The pratipadā that follows these Pūrṇimā is called Mahāpratipadā. Self-study is prohibited during these days.

**29-32.  Prātaḥ, Sāyam, Madhyāhna, and Ardharātri:** One should not engage in self-study one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after sunrise, one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after sunset, one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after midday, and one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after midnight.
