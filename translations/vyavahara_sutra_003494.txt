Under the heading "Three Chhedamutra", the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Brihat-Kalpa and Vyavahar, these three Chhedamutra are published. Due to the large number of pages, the Nisha-th-amutra has been published as a separate volume. The translation, commentary, editing, etc. of these four Chhedasutra has been done with great effort, dedication and concentration by Muni Shri Tilokmuniji in the presence of Anuyog-Pravartak Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal'. Therefore, readers should contact Muni Shri Tilokmuniji for the solution of their queries related to Chhedamutra. The Chhedasutra are included in the last section of the Agambattisi. With their publication, the publication work of all the Agamas has been completed. Therefore, as a token of gratitude, the committee presents its request. When Yuvacharya Shri Sw. Shraddhey Madhukaramuniji M. Sa. was studying the Agamas with his revered Gurudev Shri Joravarmalji M. Sa., Gurudev Shri had expressed his feelings many times that if the Agamas were made available in a simple and understandable language and style along with their commentaries, it would be very useful for reading and studying. Yuvacharya Shri was inspired by these feelings of Gurudev Shri. He discussed with his elder Guru-mata Swami Shri Hazarimlalji M., Swami Shri Brijlalji M., made plans and when he completed the plan on his own, he also informed the learned Muni Rajas and learned Sadhvis about his ideas. He consulted with the pious householders. In this way, the plan was approved by everyone and the committee. Then, on Vaishakh Shukla 10, Vikram Samvat 2036, the day of the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavir, the announcement was made to start the editing and publication of Bhagwan's teachings in the form of Agambattisi, and the work started according to the prescribed rules and regulations. On the day of Yuvacharya's Chhadar-Pradan Mahatmav, the Gracharangamutra was presented to the readers as Jinagam Granthamala Granthank 1 for their study. This publication tradition was going on at a rapid pace when a terrible incident occurred. Deep waves of sadness engulfed the committee. The planner Yuvacharya Shri passed away. This was a great loss. But, with the strength of the courage and the blessings of Sw. Yuvacharya Shri, the committee remained committed to its work. It is the result of this that the great work of publishing Agambattisi, which was started, has been completed as per the rules. The committee is grateful to Adhyatmayogini Vidushi Mahamathi Shri Umravakoovarji M. Sa. "Archana" for her guidance and for inspiring the committee to complete the work by filling the void left by Yuvacharya Shri. Padmashri Mohanmalji...

## Editorial Note: A Critical Review of the Cheda-Sutras

The Jain tradition, as understood by the Sthānakavāsī, recognizes 32 Āgamas as the word of the liberated ones (Vītarāga-vāṇī). These are: eleven Angas, twelve Upangas, four Mūlas, four Chedas, and one Prāvaśyaka. 

The Śvetāmbara Mūrti-pūjaka tradition, however, recognizes forty-five Āgamas. The number of Angas, Upangas, etc. remains the same. However, they include Mahāniśītha and Pañcakalpa along with Niśītha, Daśāśrutaskandha, Bṛhatkalpa, and Vyavahārasūtra in the Prakīrṇakas and Cheda-sūtras.

The Āgamas, including Angas, Upangas, etc., encompass all aspects of literature: religion, philosophy, ethics, culture, civilization, history, art, etc. However, they primarily focus on elaborating Jain philosophy, religious principles, and ethical practices. The Angas, Upangas, and Mūla-varga primarily deal with theoretical concepts. Ācārāṅga, Upāsaka Daśāṅga, and Prāvaśyaka Sūtras extensively discuss ethical practices. The Cheda-sūtras are the embodiments of rules and regulations for ethical purity. This note provides some insights into the Cheda-sūtras.

Why the name Cheda-sūtra? The term "Cheda" is not new to the Jain tradition. The second of the five types of conduct is called Chedopa sthāpanācāritra. While the general meaning of "Cheda" is the piercing of body parts like ears, nose, etc., the meaning of "Cheda" in the context of religion is as follows:

"Vajjhāṇuṭāṇeṇam jeṇa ṇa bāhijjjae taje ṇiyaya. Sambhavaī ya parisuddha' so puṇa dhammammī cheutti."

This means that "Cheda" is that which does not hinder religion through external actions and leads to increased purity. Therefore, the characteristic of Chedopa sthāpanā is to establish the soul in the five types of Yama-like Dharma, namely non-violence, etc., by abandoning the old, cautious practices. Or, Chedopa sthāpanā-samyama is the abandonment of actions like violence, theft, etc., with their respective distinctions, and the purification through atonement, etc., when a vow is broken. This is of two types: Nirati-cāra and Sāti-cāra.

In Nirati-cāra Chedopa sthāpanā, the practitioner is established in the five great vows, namely non-violence, etc., by separating them from the previous Samayika conduct, which involved the complete abandonment of all actions. In Sāti-cāra Chedopa sthāpanācāritra, atonement is necessary along with criticism for re-establishment (punaḥ sthāpita). This atonement is based on the severity of the transgression. There are ten types of atonement, of which Cheda-prāyaścitta is the seventh. There are seven atonements, from critical atonement to Cheda-prāyaścitta. These are given to the clothed ascetics. The last three are given to the unclothed ascetics.

---------------------------
The **Chhedaprayaschitta** is the final **prayaschitta** (atonement) given to a **veshamukta shraman** (Jain monk who has renounced all worldly possessions). It encompasses the six previous **prayaschittas**. The **moolah**, **anavasthapyai**, and **parinchikai** **prayaschittas** are considered minor, while the **prayaschittas** from **alocanaah** to **chedah** are considered major. Due to their extensive nature, the **Dasha-shruta-skandha** (**Acharadasa**), **Brihatkalpa**, **Vyavahar**, and **Nishith** **Agamas** are referred to as **Chhedasutras**.

The general subject matter of the **Chhedasutras** can be understood from the above statement. They address how to avoid and rectify any faults committed by a **sadhak** (spiritual aspirant) during their **sadhanamay** (spiritual) life. From this perspective, the topics of the **Chhedasutras** can be divided into four parts:

1. **Utsargamarga** (Path of Renunciation)
2. **Apavadamarga** (Path of Exception)
3. **Doshasevan** (Commission of Faults)
4. **Prayaschittavidhan** (Atonement Regulations)

1. **Utsargamarga**: This path refers to the rules that are mandatory for **sadhu-sadhvi** (Jain monks and nuns). It involves adhering to the **samachari** (conduct) without any deviation or alteration. This path emphasizes the practice of **nirdosha charitra** (blameless conduct). Following this path fosters **aprammatta** (mindfulness) in the **sadhak** and makes them worthy of praise and respect.

2. **Apavadamarga**: This path refers to special rules or exceptions. It is of two types: (1) **Nirdosha visheshvidhi** (blameless special rule) and (2) **Sadosha visheshvidhi** (faulty special rule). Special rules are stronger than general rules. **Apavadic** rules are based on reasons. The **praagars** (precepts) that are kept in **uttaragunapratyakhyan** (rejection of higher qualities) are all **nirdosha apavad** (blameless exceptions). An action or tendency that does not violate **prajna** (wisdom) is considered **nirdosha**. However, due to strong reasons, even if the mind is unwilling, one may be compelled to commit a fault. This is considered **sadosha apavad** (faulty exception). **Prayaschitta** (atonement) purifies such faults. This path protects the **sadhak** from **praart-raudr dhyan** (meditation that is harsh and violent). While not praiseworthy, this path is not so reprehensible as to cause public criticism. **Anachar** (immoral conduct) cannot be considered a part of the **apavadvidhi** (exceptional rule) in any form. Engaging in **swaichar** (self-indulgence) out of free will and desire, violating boundaries, prioritizing one's own interests, ego, and pride, disregarding the **sangha** (community), exhibiting arrogance, and breaking discipline are all considered **anachar**. This is unthinkable, but **anachari** (immoral person) resorts to tricks and tactics to make it thinkable. Such a person, a **sadhak**, cannot be purified by any method and is not worthy of purification.

3. & 4. **Doshasevan** and **Prayaschittavidhan**: **Doshasevan** refers to the violation of the **Utsargamarga** and **Apavadamarga**. **Prayaschitta** is the method used to purify such violations. When a fault is committed unintentionally due to strong reasons, forgetfulness, or negligence, **prayaschitta** is necessary for purification. This is the general outline of the **Chhedasutras**. The **prayaschitta** is mandatory for the purification of faults. This is evident from the above statement. In this context, some specific points are highlighted. [10] 

Page #12:
---------------------------
The reason for placing Charitraachar amidst the five principles of Anugardharma is that it is the only means by which the combined practice of Jnanaachar, Darshanachar, and Tapaachar-Veeryachar can be accomplished without hindrance. Charitraachar has eight divisions: five Samitis and three Guptis. The five Samitis are like a retreat-oriented tendency in a disciplined life, while the three Guptis are purely retreat-oriented. Their role in Anugardharma practice is evident in an unprecedented joy and enthusiasm. However, due to the influence of worldly attachments, passions, and aversions, if the boundaries of Samitis, Guptis, and Mahavrats are occasionally transgressed, violated, or exceeded, then Prayashchitta acts as a protective wall. The implication is that if there is a persistent attachment to the original qualities (Moolgunas) and the subsequent qualities (Uttargunas), then Prayashchitta is mandatory for their removal. The reason for the prominence of Chhed Prayashchitta is that there are ten types of Prayashchitta. The first six Prayashchittas are for the purification of general faults, while the last four are for the purification of strong faults. Chhedarha Prayashchitta is the first of the last four Prayashchittas. The commentators, while explaining it, have presented an allegory from Ayurveda. Its essence is that if a person's limbs or organs become so contaminated by disease or poison that there is no possibility of recovery through treatment, then it is appropriate to amputate that limb or organ through surgery. However, the disease or poison should not be allowed to spread throughout the body. Because if this is not done, untimely death is inevitable. But before amputation, it is the duty of the physician to explain to the patient and his close relatives that the limb or organ has become so contaminated by disease that there is no possibility of recovery through nourishing treatment. If they want to protect their life and be free from pain, they should have the limb or organ amputated through surgery. Although there will be intense pain during the surgery, it will be for a short time, but the rest of their life will be free from the current pain. If, after this explanation, the patient and his guardians agree to the amputation, then it is the duty of the physician to amputate the limb or organ and protect the body and life from the disease. In the same way, the Acharya and other Anugars should be explained that due to the persistent attachment to faults, your subsequent qualities have become so contaminated that their purification is no longer possible through ordinary Prayashchittas like criticism, etc. Now, if you wish, the days of persistent attachment can be amputated and the rest of your disciplined life can be secured. Otherwise, neither Samadhi death nor liberation from the cycle of birth and death will be possible. If, after this explanation, the Anugar abandons persistent attachment and accepts Chhed Prayashchitta, then the Acharya should purify him by giving him Chhed Prayashchitta. It should be noted here that Chhed Prayashchitta only purifies the faults attached to the subsequent qualities. The faults attached to the original qualities are purified by Moolha, etc., three Prayashchittas. The style of description in Chhed Sutras: There are three types of Charitraachar described in Chhed Sutras: (1) Heyaachar, (2) Jneyaachar, (3) Upadeyaachar. Upon careful consideration of these, the following forms emerge: (1) Vidhikल्प, (2) Nishedhakल्प, (3) Vidhinisedhakल्प, (4) Prayashchittakalp, (5) Prakirnak. Of these, there will be four divisions of the other Vidhi-kalp, etc., besides Prayashchittakalp. [11]

(1) Legal precepts for the Nirgranthas, (2) Legal precepts for the Nigranthis, (3) Legal precepts for the Nirgrantha-Nigranthis, (4) General legal precepts / Similarly, one should also understand the prohibitive precepts, etc. / The sutras in which the word 'Kappar' is used are the legal precepts. Those in which the word 'No Kappar' is used are the prohibitive precepts. Those in which both 'Kappar' and 'No Kappar' are used are the legal-prohibitive precepts and those in which neither 'Kappar' nor 'No Kappar' is used are the legal precepts. There is a clear mention of the atonement ordinance in the sutras for the atonement ordinance. After mentioning the legal-prohibitive precepts from the general in the Cheda Sutras, a clear indication of the legal and prohibitive precepts for the Nirgranthas has been given. Similarly, the statement of the legal-prohibitive precepts for the Nirgranthi is there. It is not possible to give a detailed list here of what and what form of legal-prohibitive precepts are for both and how much atonement ordinance is there for each in case of transgression. Readers should know this from the study of the scriptures. The atonement ordinance is the ordinance of atonement for the removal of the fault of the giver and the receiver. There is a detailed description of the eligibility of the taker and the giver in the Cheda Sutras. We are giving some indication of its brief summary here. Atikram, Vyatikram, Atichar, Anachar are the causes of transgression / But those who do not criticize the faults due to crookedness and inertia, they can never become eligible for purification / Even if someone criticizes deceitfully, then also his criticism is not fruitful. If his mind is not ready to criticize, then doing atonement is like a sky flower. The essence of the above statement is that the critic should be righteous, free from deceit. He should have a feeling of repentance within him, only then he will be able to be ready for the removal of the fault. Similarly, the one who listens to the criticism of the critic and is entitled to help in his purification is the one who knows the essence of the atonement ordinance, is neutral, knows the feelings of others, is able to know the situation, is himself innocent, is impartial, is a worthy speaker. Such a senior practitioner can make the guilty innocent. Can discipline the Sangha and remove public slander, misconceptions. Based on this brief introduction, we now present a brief introduction to the three Cheda Sutras compiled in this book - 1. Dasashrutaskandha, 2. Brihatkalpa and 3. Vyavahar. (1) Dasashrutaskandha or Pracharadasha Samavayanga, Uttaradhyayanasutra and Avasyaksutra have been called Ayardasa (Acharadasha) or name before Kalpa and Vyavaharsutra. Therefore, this is the first Cheda Sutra in the Cheda Sutras. Since its ten chapters are mentioned in the tenth place of the Stanangasutra, the name 'Dasashrutaskandha' has become more popular. The names of the ten chapters are as follows - 1. Asamadhisthan, 2. Sabaldosha, 3. Ashatana, 4. Ganisampada, 5. Chittsamadhisthan, 6. Upasakpratima, 7. Bhiksapratima, 8. Paryushanakalpa 9. Mohaniyasthan and 10. Ayatisthan / In these ten chapters, Asamadhisthan, [12]

---------------------------
The elements compiled in the Chittasamadhi Sthana, Mohaniya Sthana and Ayati Sthana are actually related to Yoga Vidya. If compared with Yoga Shastra, it will be known that these four studies are very important in the ten studies of the Pracharadasha for concentrating and unifying the mind. The Upasakapratima and Bhikhuapratima impart knowledge of the highest rules of the most rigorous practice of the Shravak and Shraman. In the Paryushana Kalpa, it has been discussed in detail how to observe Paryushana, how to celebrate it, and when to celebrate it. The two Dashaanas, Sabaldosha and Ashatana, discuss the daily rules of Sadhu life and state that these rules should be followed. What is to be abandoned should be abandoned firmly and what is to be adopted should be followed. The fourth Dashaganisampada describes the personality, influence and physical influence of the person sitting on the Acharya Pad in a very useful way. Those who are interested in the Acharya Pad must study this before taking the Acharya Pad. Thus, this Dasha Shruta Skandha (Acharadasha) holds a very important place in the Shraman life. In other words, the subject matter of the Dasha Shruta Skandha can also be mentioned in this way: The first three Dashaanas and the last two Dashaanas describe the Heyachar of the Sadhak. The fourth Dasha describes the Gneyachar of the Agitart Anugar and the Upadeyachar for the Gitart Anugar. The fifth Dasha describes the Upadeyachar. The sixth Dasha describes the Jayachar for the Anugar and the Upadeyachar for the Sagar (Shramanopasak). The seventh Dasha describes the Upadeyachar for the Anugar and the Gneyachar for the Sagar. The eighth Dasha describes some Gneyachar, some Heyachar and some Upadeyachar for the Anugar. Thus, this Acharadasha-Dasha Shruta Skandha is useful for both Anugar and Sagar. The Heya, Gney and Upadeya Prachar have also been mentioned in the Cheda Sutras like Kalpa, Vyavahar etc. (2) The word Kalpa in the Brihatkalpasutra is indicative of many meanings. This word is found in Vedic literature. There are six limbs of the Veda, one of which is the limb that contains the rules of rituals like Yajna, that limb is called Kalpa. The word Kalpa is also used for time. The time of fourteen Manvantaras is known by the word Kalpa. Four billion, thirty-two crore years pass in it. This long period of time is called Kalpa. The word Kalpa is also used in a similar sense, such as Shraman Kalpa, Rishi Kalpa etc. The word Kalpa is also used for the tree that gives the desired fruit, it is called Kalpavriksha. The word Kalpa is also used for the limits of the kingdom. There are limits of politics up to the twelfth Devaloka. For this reason, those Devalokas are called 'Kalpa Devalokas'. Whoever lives life according to the legal rules, he surely becomes rich in happiness and wealth. The word Kalpa, which is used to describe the present scripture, is completely different from the above meanings. [13] 

Page #15:
---------------------------
In this context, the word "Kalpa" refers to Dharma-Maryada (religious norms and boundaries).  Sadhu Achar (conduct of a monk) is Dharma-Maryada.  Any scripture that describes Dharma-Maryada is called Kalpa, as the name reflects the subject matter.  A name that accurately reflects the subject matter of a scripture is called a "Yatharth Naam" (true name).  A scripture that provides instructions and boundaries for the internal and external conduct of a Sadhu is called Kalpa.  The scripture that contains the life stories of Bhagwan Mahavir, Parshvanath, Arishtanemi, and Rishabhdev, has a final chapter that describes the conduct of a Sadhu.  This scripture is called "Paryushana Kalpa" and is considered a "Lahu Kalpa" (smaller Kalpa).  In comparison, a scripture that describes Sadhu-Maryada in detail is called "Bhatva Kalpa" (larger Kalpa).  It generally describes the rules and regulations of the three types of conduct: Samayik, Chhedopasthapaneya, and Parihar Vishuddhi.  It is essential for those who follow these types of conduct to adhere to all the descriptions in the Brihat Kalpa scripture.  The scripture that describes the various norms of Sadhu and Sadhvi is called "Bhat Kalpa Sutra".  In Prakrit language, it is called "Bihakkappa Suttam".  Are the present "Kappsuttam" (Kalpa Sutra) and "Kappsury" (Kalpa Shruta) the same or different?  This doubt is irrelevant because "Kappsuttam" is a Kalik Agam (scripture of the time).  The eighth study of Acharadasha (conduct) or Dasha Shruta Skandha is "Paryushana Kalpa", which only describes the conduct during the rainy season.  A few centuries ago, this "Paryushana Kalpa" was combined with the life stories of Tirthankaras and the list of elders (Sthaviravali).  Gradually, it became known as "Kalpa Sutra" among the general public.  To differentiate the present Kalpa Sutra from this one, the present Kalpa Sutra is called "Bhat Kalpa Sutra".  In reality, there is no mention of a scripture named "Bhat Kalpa Sutra" in any other scripture.  In the Nandisutra, it is called "Kapo".  There are two divisions of "Kappsury": "Chullakappsury" and "Mahakappsury".  Similarly, "Kappiyakappiyan" is also an Utkalik Agam (scripture of the time).  All these are scriptures that prescribe atonement, but they are fragmented, according to the historians of Jain literature.  The original text of the present "Kappsuttam" is in prose and contains 473 Anushtup Shlokas.  It contains 81 rules and prohibitions (Vidhi-Nishedhakalpa).  All these Kalpas are related to the five Samitis (vows) and five Mahavratas (great vows).  Therefore, they are classified here.  The scriptures that are related to more than one Samiti or more than one Mahavrat are placed under the heading "Samiti and Mahavrat's combined rules and prohibitions" and "Mahavrat Kalpa".  According to Uttaradhyayanasutra Chapter 24, the subject of Iryasamiti is very broad, so the scriptures that appear to be generally related to knowledge, perception, or conduct, etc., are placed under the heading "Iryasamiti's rules and prohibitions".  The classification chart is as follows: (1) Iryasamiti's rules and prohibitions: 1. Charsutra, 2. Adhwagaman Sutra, 3. Aryakshetra Sutra, 4. Mahandi Sutra, 5. Bairajya-Viruddha Rajya Sutra, 6. Antagruhastha, 7. Vachana Sutra, 8. Sanjnapya Sutra, 9. Ganantaropa Sampat Sutra, 10. Kalpasthiti Sutra.  1. Abhidhan Rajendra: Volume 3, page 239 discusses the word "Kappsury".  [14]

The word "vyavahar" is formed from the combination of the prefixes "vi" and "av" and the root "har". "Vi" indicates diversity or method, "av" indicates doubt, and "har" indicates the action of removing. Therefore, "vyavahar" refers to the removal of various doubts related to a matter of dispute. This is the specific meaning of the word "vyavahar".

The main topics of the "vyavahar sutra" are: 1. "vyavahar" (conduct), 2. "vyavahari" (one who conducts), and 3. "vyavahartavya" (that which is to be conducted).

The last sutra of the tenth uddeśaka states that there are five "vyavahar karan" (means of conduct). The "vyavahari" (those who conduct the action of conduct) are the "geetarth" (teachers, etc.) who purify the "gan" (community). The "shraman" and "shramanis" (monks and nuns) are the "vyavahartavya" (those who are to be conducted). This means that the "vyavaharajna" (one who knows conduct) conducts the action of purifying the "gan" from transgressions. Just as a potter (doer) uses a wheel, a stick, clay, and a thread, etc. (means) to make a pot (action), similarly, the "vyavaharajna" uses "vyavahar" (conduct) to purify the "vyavahartavya" (community) from transgressions.

There are two main interpretations of "vyavahar": 1. "laukika" (worldly) and 2. "lokoत्तर" (transcendental). The "laukika" interpretation is of two types: 1. "samanya" (general) and 2. "vishesh" (specific). The general interpretation is conduct with others or the exchange of money. The specific interpretation is the entire process of litigation, i.e., justice.

There are some words related to this specific interpretation that have been in use since ancient times in the Vedic tradition of "shruti" (revealed knowledge) and "smriti" (remembered knowledge). These include:

1. "vyavaharshastra" (law code): This deals with the rules made collectively by the state government on a particular subject, the decisions made on those rules, and the punishments given for breaking those rules.

1. "Vi" for "nanartha" (various meanings), "av" for "sandeha" (doubt), "haran" is called "har" (removal). "Vyavahar" is the situation because of the removal of various doubts. - Katyayana

2. "There are four types of men, as stated in the "ganasohikare" (community purification) sutra. One of them is not a "manakare" (one who is not a monk). - "Vyavahar" (conduct) "purushaprakar" (types of men) sutra

3. "The "vahari" (one who conducts) is the doer, the "vyavahar" is the means. The "vahariyavva" (that which is to be conducted) is the action, like the making of a pot. - "Vyavahar" "bhadyapithika" (commentary) "gatha" (verse) 2

4. "No one is a friend of anyone, and no one is an enemy of anyone. Friends and enemies are created through conduct. - "Hitopadeśa" (moral stories) "Mitra" (friend) 72

5. "The arrangement of words in the case of mutual disagreement among humans regarding their own interests is called "vyavahar". - "Mitakshara" (commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti) [16]

2. A **Vyavahārjña** (judge) who is knowledgeable in **Vyavahārśāstra** (law) is the one who considers and decides on accusations, etc., with discernment.  There are two types of **lokoत्तर** interpretations: 1. General and 2. Specific. / The general interpretation is the conduct of one **gaṇa** (group) with another **gaṇa**, or the conduct of one **śramaṇa** (ascetic) with another **śramaṇa**, or the conduct of one **ācārya**, **upādhyāya**, etc., with another **ācārya**, **upādhyāya**, etc. / The specific interpretation is the "**vapan**" (sowing) of **tapa** (austerities) and other practices through the **sarvajñokta vidhi** (method of the omniscient) and the removal of **atičārajanaya pāpa** (sin arising from transgression) is **vyavahāra**. The commentator instructs that the word **vyavahāra** is created by combining the word **hāra** with the word **vyav** in place of the word **vivāpa**. There are two types of **vyavahāra**: 1. **vidhi vyavahāra** and 2. **avidhi vyavahāra**. / **Avidhi vyavahāra** is against **mokṣa** (liberation), therefore it is not the subject of this sūtra, but **vidhi vyavahāra** is its subject. There are four types of **vyavahāra**: 1. **nāma vyavahāra**, 2. **sthāpanā vyavahāra**, 3. **dravya vyavahāra**, and 4. **bhāva vyavahāra**. 1. **Nāma vyavahāra** - a particular person being named **vyavahāra**. / 2. **Sthāpanā vyavahāra** - the true or false representation of a person named **vyavahāra**. / 3. **Dravya vyavahāra** has two divisions: from **āgama** (scripture) and from **noāgama** (non-scripture). From **āgama** - the knower of the **vyavahāra** word which is unsuitable (useless). / From **noāgama** - **dravya vyavahāra** is of three types: 1. **jñaśarīra**, 2. **bhavyasarīra**, and 3. **tadvyatirikta**. / **Jñaśarīra** - the dead body of the knower of the **vyavahāra** word. / **Bhavyasarīra** - the future body of the knower of the **vyavahāra** word. / **Tadvyaitirikta** **dravya vyavahāra** - **vyavahāra** scripture or book. / This is of three types: 1. **laukika**, 2. **lokoत्तर**, and 3. **kuprāvanika**. The development of **laukika** **dravya vyavahāra** began with the development of humans from the **bhogabhūmi** (land of enjoyment). Even in that ancient time, men lived as husbands and women as wives, but their sexual desire was very limited. They had only two children (at once) in their entire life. Of these, one was a boy and one was a girl. "We two, our two" was the motto of their worldly life. They would become husband and wife in their youth. 1. **Vyav. Bhāṣya. Pīṭhikā Gā. 4** / 2. **Vyav.

Their means of livelihood were Kalpavriksha / Sitting on gold in their shade, eating fruits, drinking the nectar of trees / They wore bark and listened to the music of trees every moment / They did not work, nor did they have any kind of worry, therefore they were long-lived and very happy. They did not do Dharma, nor did they do sinful deeds, there was no speaker, no listener, they were not arrogant, no one punished them, there was no ruler, nor were they ruled. Such was the life of the couple / The cycle of time was moving. The land of enjoyment was beginning to turn into the land of karma. The means of livelihood, Kalpavriksha, were disappearing. The problems of eating, drinking, and sleeping were beginning to torment them. What to eat and drink? Where to live, where to sleep? Above was the sky, below was the earth. How to protect oneself from cold, heat, and rain?  Many such worries had surrounded man. There was a scramble for food and drink. Premature deaths began to occur and the life of the couple (husband and wife) became unmatched. The first Sushma-Sushma period and the second Sushma period had ended. The two divisions of the third Sushma-Dushma period had also ended. The third division's vicious cycle was going on / It was a time of transition / For the sake of happiness, peace, and order, the first five Kulkaras first tortured the criminals with the 'Hat' verbal punishment, but after some time this punishment became ineffective. This was the first principle of the suppression policy of punishment. The era of implanting violence in the human heart began here. The second five Kulkaras influenced the attackers by torturing them with the "Mat" verbal punishment, but this punishment also became ineffective as time passed / The third five Kulkaras ruled and suppressed those who spread unrest with the "Dhik" verbal punishment. Although these three punishments of the punishable were only verbal punishments, but the punishment, synonymous with violence, did not make man gentle but cruel, not merciful but wicked. The name of the first Kulkar was "Sumati". He was to use "Shaman" for the happiness and prosperity of mankind, but influenced by the crooked cycles of time, he also started the vicious cycle of "Daman". The last Kulkar was Shri Rishabhdev. When the punishment policy of condemnation also failed, the Karma Tripdi "1 Asi, 2 Masi, 3 Krishi" emerged from the mouth of Lord Rishabhdev (Adinath). The sunrise of human social life took place / Human society was divided into two classes / One class of rulers and one class of ruled. The minority ruling class began to discipline the majority ruled class. Lord Adinath's son Bharat became the emperor / He also began to use the suppression policy inherited from his ancestors on his brothers. When the original source of Upshamars, Lord Adinath (Rishabhdev), encouraged Bahubali and others for an eternal (spiritual) kingdom, they agreed. Because the humans of that era were of 'righteous nature'. The burning desire for the kingdom in the hearts of the brothers was completely extinguished by the invincible stream of non-violence.

From the time of Bhagwan Ajitanath to Bhagwan Parshvanath, it was the era of 'Rijprajna' humans. During the reign of eleven Chakravartis, nine Baldevs, nine Vasudevas and nine Prativa-sudevas, the cycle of punishment was so oppressive that people almost forgot the gentle path of Shraman-niti. The policies of inducement, punishment and division were widely propagated. Now, the era of 'Vakrajada' humans has arrived. The human heart is dominated by crookedness and inertia. Punishment (suppression) has been considered essential for social order. Mutilation and capital punishment have become commonplace. Penal codes and instruments of punishment have been created. Criminal courts and criminology have also developed. In the past, weapons like Agniyastra and in the present, weapons like nuclear bombs have been used to suppress people through cruel punishment. In ancient literature, there is a description of a Dandapani (Yama Raja), but today, many Dandapanis can be seen walking around everywhere. This is worldly material interaction. Lokottara Dravyavyavahar - the interaction of free Shramans who disregard the teachings of Acharyas, etc., with other free Shramans, such as the exchange of food, etc. Lokottara Bhavyavyavahar - this is of two types: 1. From Pagam and 2. From Nomagam. From Agam - the one who knows the meaning of the word 'Upayukta Vyavahar'. From Nomagam, there are five types of behavior: 1. Agam, 2. Shruta, 3. Agyan, 4. Dharana, 5. Jeet. 1. Where there is Pagam, establish behavior from Pagam. 2. Where there is no Agam, but Shruta, establish behavior from Shruta. 3. Where there is no Shruta, but Prajna, establish behavior from Prajna. 4. Where there is no Prajna, but Dharana, establish behavior from Dharana. 5. Where there is no Dharana, but Jeet, establish behavior from Jeet. Establish behavior from these five: 1. Pagam, 2. Shruta, 3. Prajna, 4. Dharana and 5. Jeet. Wherever any of these exist, establish behavior from that. Question: Bhanta! What have the Pagambalik Shraman Nirgranthas said (regarding these five behaviors)? Answer: (Ayushman Shramans) In these five behaviors, whenever there is a particular behavior in a particular matter, the Shraman Nirgrantha, remaining neutral (middle ground), behaves correctly and becomes a follower of the command! 1.

**Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Kevalgyanis, Manahparyavgyanis, and Avadhigyanis. The method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the fourteen, ten, and nine Purvadhars are also Agamvyavahar.

**Shrutavyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the eight Purna and the ninth Aapurnna Purvadhars. The method of conduct and prohibitions prescribed by the Dasha (Ayara Dasha - Dasha Shruta Skandha), Kalpa (Brihat Kalpa), Vyavahar, Achar Prakalpa (Nishita), etc. Cheda Shruta (Shastra) are also Shrutavyavahar.

**Agyavvyavahar** is when two Geetarth Shramans are traveling in different distant lands and are not likely to meet in the near future. If one of them needs to perform penance for a Kalpika Pratiseshana, they should send their transgression to the Geetarth Shishya. If there is no Geetarth Shishya, then they should send their transgression in a symbolic language to the distant Geetarth Muni through a Dharanakushal Ageetarth Shishya. The Geetarth Muni should then consider the Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, Bhava, Sanhanan, Dhairya, Bal, etc. and go there themselves to perform the penance. Alternatively, they can send the Geetarth Shishya to explain the situation. If there is no Geetarth Shishya, then they should send a message of penance for the transgression in symbolic language along with the person who brought the message of the transgression. This is Agyavvyavahar.

**Dharnavvyavahar** is when a Geetarth Shraman performs penance for a transgression based on Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, and Bhava. The Shraman who remembers this penance should perform the same penance for someone who commits the same transgression.

**Agamvyavahar** can be divided into three categories based on the concept of Dharna: Utkrishta, Madhyama, and Jaghanya.

1. **Utkrishta Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Kevalgyanis, as Kevalgyan is complete direct knowledge.

2. **Madhyama Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Manahparyavgyanis and Avadhigyanis, as these two types of knowledge are partial (Desha) direct knowledge, but they are still self-relative.

3. **Jaghanya Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the fourteen, ten, and nine Purvadhars, as they are specific Shruta, but they are indirect knowledge.

"Dharṇāvyavahāra" is the practice of accepting and adhering to a particular conduct. Alternatively, "Vaiyāvatya" refers to the service rendered by a Śramaṇa to the Gaṇa. If such a Śramaṇa is unable to learn the "Chhedaśruta," the Guru Mahārāja makes him undertake certain "Prāyaścitta" practices, which is also considered "Dharṇāvyavahāra." "Jītavyavahāra" encompasses "Sthiti," "Kalpa," "Maryādā," and "Vyavasthā," all synonyms of "Jīta." Pure conduct, as prescribed by "Gīta-ārtha," is "Jītavyavahāra." "Jītavyavahāra" also includes performing "Prāyaścitta" practices that are either less or more than what is prescribed in the Śruta, but are traditionally followed. If, in addition to the reasons mentioned in the Sūtra, other reasons arise, and the resulting "Aticāra" is addressed through "Prāyaścitta" practices as prescribed by various "Gīta-ārtha," it is also considered "Jītavyavahāra." "Jītavyavahāra" also includes the rules and prohibitions established by various "Gīta-ārtha" and unanimously agreed upon.

If, while "Āgamavyavahāra" is applicable for the "Prāyaścitta" of violating the "Vyavahārapañcaka," a Śramaṇa resorts to "Śrutavyavahāra," he is liable for the "Prāyaścitta" of four "Guru." Similarly, if, while "Śrutavyavahāra" is applicable, a Śramaṇa resorts to "Prājñāvyavahāra," or if, while "Yājñāvyavahāra" is applicable, he resorts to "Dharṇāvyavahāra," or if, while "Dharṇāvyavahāra" is applicable, he resorts to "Jītavyavahāra," he is liable for the "Prāyaścitta" of four "Guru." The "Vyavahārapañcaka" must be applied in a sequential order, starting from the beginning, and applying them in reverse order is strictly prohibited. An "Āgamavyavahārī" should only practice "Āgamavyavahāra" and not other practices like "Śruta" etc., because just as the light of the sun renders the light of a lamp unnecessary, so too, the "Āgama" is the primary source of guidance.

"The conduct of a Jina (as long as the fourfold assembly exists) remains / Other conduct ceases. If the conduct of a non-Jain involves violence to living beings in grains, juices, fruits, and flowers, then purification is achieved by licking ghee. If one steals cotton, silk, wool, animals with one or two hooves, birds, fragrant substances, medicines, and ropes, etc., then purification is achieved by drinking milk for three days. A Brahmin who has memorized the Rig Veda, even if he kills all three worlds or eats anywhere, does not incur any sin. In the summer, one should perform the five-fire penance, in the rainy season, one should sit in the shade of a tree during the rain, and in the autumn, one should wear wet clothes - in this way, one should gradually increase the penance. / "The terms 'vyavahari', 'vyavaharajna', and 'vyavaharta' are synonymous. One who is devoted to the Dharma, firm in the Dharma, detached, fearful of sin, knowledgeable of the sutras, and free from attachment and aversion (impartial) is a 'vyavahari'. If one gives the atonement prescribed by the scriptures according to the transgression, considering the substance, place, time, feeling, the person who is a transgressor, and the nature of the transgression, then the 'vyavaharajna' (giver of atonement) is a 'aradhaka'. 1.

"A practitioner (penitent) who performs minor and major penances with attachment and aversion, without contemplating the substance, field, etc., is contradictory." The practices to be performed are non-scriptural. These are of many types. There are four types of non-scriptural: 1. It is one-time but heavy-karma, therefore it is a non-worshipper of Dharma. 2. It is one-time and light-karma, therefore it is a worshipper of Dharma. 3. It is one-time and heavy-karma, therefore it is a non-worshipper of Dharma. 4. It is one-time and light-karma, therefore it is a worshipper of Dharma. Similarly, there are four types of non-scriptural women. There are five types of non-scriptural: 1. Pulaka - whose disciplined life is like straw, without essence. Although he has faith in the truth, he also performs rituals, but he also uses the benefits obtained from penance and maintains a conduct that seems like knowledge transgression. 2. Bakusha - these are of two types: instrument-bakusha and body-bakusha. One who is engaged in decorating instruments and body and is desirous of prosperity and fame. He consumes transgressions worthy of hole penance. 3. Kushil - this is of two types: 1. Pratisevna Kushil and 2. Kashaya Kushil. Pratisevna Kushil who transgresses in the post-qualities like Pindashuddhi etc. Kashaya Kushil - who is not able to remain stable in his natural state due to the occasional rise of agitated passions. 4. Nimranth - pacified-delusion non-scriptural. 5. Graduate, Yogikevali and Ayogikevali. There are many varieties of these five non-scriptural. All these are practicable. As long as the knowledge of the first restraint and fourteen previous births remained, the aforementioned ten penances were given. Their 1. Gaha which is well-composed, is well-explained and well-known. In the context of conduct, it is the measure of well-behaved ones. The context of conduct is the ultimate knowledge of the well-behaved. One who understands this from the truth, is a well-behaved one. 2. One who is big in the initiation stage. 3. One who is small in the initiation stage. Thanam 04, U. 3, Sutra 320. - Vyav.

The remaining eight *prāyaśchitta* will be given until the *tīrtha* (fourfold assembly). *Pulāka* was given six *prāyaśchitta* until *vyutsarma*. *Pratisevaka-bakusha* and *pratisevaka-kushila* are given all ten *prāyaśchitta*. *Sthavira* are not given *anavastapya* and *paranchik* *prāyaśchitta*; the remaining eight *prāyaśchitta* are given. *Nirgrantha* can only be given two *prāyaśchitta* - 1 *ālochanā*, 2 *viveka* / *Snātaka* only takes one *prāyaśchitta* - *viveka* / They are not given any *prāyaśchitta*. 1 Those with *sāmāyika-chāritra* are given eight *prāyaśchitta* without *ched* and *mūla*. 2 Those with *chedopasthāpanīya-chāritra* are given all ten *prāyaśchitta*. 3 Those with *parihāra-vishuddhi-chāritra* are given *pāṭha* *prāyaśchitta* until *mūla*. 4 Those with *sūkṣma-samparāya-chāritra* and 5 those with *yathākhyāta-chāritra* are given only two *prāyaśchitta* 1 *ālochanā* and 2 *viveka* / All these are practical / 2 When a *vyavahāra-jña* (knower of conduct) uses the conduct from one of the five conducts with a *vyavahartavya* (a *śramaṇa* or *śramaṇī* who is worthy of conduct), then he gives *prāyaśchitta* to the one who prohibits the conduct or the one who makes the prohibition a conduct, then the word *vyavahāra* becomes synonymous with the *tapa* in the form of *prāyaśchitta*.

**Vyavahar (Prayaschitta) Ko Upadeyata**

**Question:** Bhagwan! What is the benefit of Prayaschitta to a Jiva? 

**Answer:** Prayaschitta purifies the sinful karma and makes the character pure. By performing Prayaschitta in the right way, the path (Samyagdarshan) and the fruit of the path (knowledge) are purified. The conduct and the fruit of conduct (Mokshamarg) are purified.

## Types of Atonement (Prayschitta)

1. **Jnana Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of knowledge, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
2. **Darshan Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of perception, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
3. **Charitra Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of conduct, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
4. **Viyatt Kicchapaayachchitte:** This fourth type of atonement has two interpretations:
    * **Viyattkicchapaayachchitte:** Atonement for explicit actions.
        * This has two meanings:
            * **Explicit:** The atonement act prescribed by the Acharya is the remedy for the sin. This means that when an Acharya prescribes atonement, they consider the transgressor's possessions, location, time, and emotions. Whether the prescribed atonement is mentioned in the Dashakalpa-Vyavahar or not, it still purifies the soul.
            * **Explicit:** Atonement act clearly specified in the sutras.
    * **Chiyattkicchapaayachchitte:** Atonement for abandoned actions.
        * **Chiyatt:** This word also means "pleasing." Acts pleasing to the Acharya, such as repentance, are also forms of atonement.

**Ten Types of Atonement:**

1. **Palochana Yogya:** Atonement for transgressions that can be purified through self-criticism.
2. **Atikram:** Transgression of fundamental principles.
3. **Vyatikram:** Deviation from fundamental principles.
4. **Atichara:** Transgression.
5. **Anaacharasevi:** Those who commit transgressions.

**Punishment vs. Atonement:**

* Punishment is harsh, while atonement is relatively gentle.
* Punishment is accepted unwillingly, while atonement is accepted willingly.
* Punishment suppresses desires, while atonement mitigates them.

**Number of Transgressions:**

* **Jnana:** 14 transgressions
* **Darshan:** 5 transgressions
* **Charitra:** 106 transgressions
    * 25 transgressions from the five great vows
    * 2 transgressions from abstaining from nighttime meals
    * 4 transgressions from Iryasamiti
    * 2 transgressions from Bhashasamiti
    * 47 transgressions from Eshan asamiti
    * 2 transgressions from Adan Nikshepanasamiti
    * 10 transgressions from Paristhapanasamiti
    * 9 transgressions from the three Guptis
    * 5 transgressions from Sanlekhana

**Note:** The Sanskrit equivalent of "Chiyatt" meaning "pleasing" is not found. (Source: Ardhamagadhi Kosh, Part 2, Chiyatt word, page 628)

---------------------------
## Translation:

**(1)** **Aalochana Yogya:**  A transgression that is worthy of Aalochana (criticism) is a type of atonement.  Transgressions of the Eshana Samiti and Paristhapana Samiti are often worthy of Aalochana.

**(2)** **Pratikramana Yogya:**  Transgressions that can be purified through Pratikramana (confession and repentance) are worthy of Pratikramana. Transgressions of Samitis and Guptis are often worthy of Pratikramana.

**(3)** **Ubhay Yogya:**  Transgressions that can be purified by both Aalochana and Pratikramana are worthy of both types of atonement. Transgressions committed by misidentifying Ekendriyadi Jivas (beings with one sense organ) or by causing them to migrate are worthy of both Aalochana and Pratikramana.

**(4)** **Viveka Yogya:**  Transgressions that are purified by Viveka (discernment) or Parityaag (renunciation) are worthy of Viveka (renunciation) atonement. If one consumes food that is considered Adhakarma (unsuitable for a Jain), then renouncing it is the Viveka Yogya atonement.

**(5)** **Vyutsarga Yogya:**  Transgressions that are purified by restraining bodily actions and stabilizing the mind in the intended goal are worthy of Vyutsarga atonement. The Kayotsarga (body restraint) performed after crossing a river is a Vyutsarga Yogya atonement.

**(6)** **Tap Yogya:**  Transgressions that can only be purified by Tap (austerity) are worthy of Tap atonement. Transgressions mentioned in the Nishisuthra are often worthy of Tap (Murumas, Laghumas) atonement.

**(7)** **Chhed Yogya:**  Transgressions that can be purified by Diksha Chhed (breaking the vow of initiation) are worthy of Chhed atonement. Some transgressions of the five Mahavratas (great vows) are worthy of Chhed atonement.

**(8)** **Mool Yogya:**  Transgressions that can only be purified by re-taking the Mahavratas are worthy of Mool atonement.  The transgression of one or more Mahavratas is worthy of Mool atonement.

**(9)** **Anvasthapya Yogya:**  Transgressions that can only be purified by renouncing the vows and the attire are worthy of Anvasthapya atonement.  Unjustified criticism, indulgence in the path of transgression, repeated transgression of a single act, and transgression of multiple acts simultaneously are worthy of Chhed atonement. Just as the amputation of a diseased limb is necessary to protect the remaining body, similarly, the removal of a corrupted vow is necessary to protect the remaining vows.

**(2)**  A person who kills one or more Panchendriya Pranis (beings with five senses), breaks their vows, speaks falsehood with a deliberate and impure mind, takes what is not given, possesses possessions, adopts the attire of a Parivrajaka (ascetic) or a Grihastha (householder), is worthy of Mool atonement.

**(3)**  There are three types of Anvasthapya Yogya transgressions: 
    1. Stealing from a Sadhmika (a fellow Jain)
    2. Stealing from an Anyarmika (a non-Jain)
    3. Striking with a stick, fist, or other weapon.

(10) **Parāṃcik**-worthy transgressions, which can only be purified by adopting the garb of a householder and performing the prescribed austerities for a very long time, are **Parāṃcik**-penance worthy. A person undergoing this penance is excluded from the shelter, village, and country. The main reasons for penance are: 1. **Atikrama** - the intention to commit a transgression / 2. **Vyatikrama** - collecting the means to commit a transgression / 3. **Atichāra** - initiating a transgression. 4. **Anāchāra** - committing a transgression. There are three types of **Atikrama**: 1. **Atikrama** of knowledge, 2. **Atikrama** of perception, 3. **Atikrama** of conduct. Similarly, there are **Vyatikrama**, **Atichāra**, and **Anāchāra** of knowledge. There are also three types each of perception and conduct. **Atikrama** of knowledge is of three types: 1. **Jaghanya**, 2. **Madhyama**, 3. **Utkṛṣṭa**. Similarly, there are **Vyatikrama**, **Atichāra**, and **Anāchāra** of knowledge. There are also three types each of perception and conduct. If **Atikrama** of knowledge, etc., has occurred, then one should criticize oneself in front of the guru, perform **pratikramāṇa**, and purify oneself by means of censure, deep reflection, etc., make a firm resolve not to commit the transgression again, and perform penance in the form of austerities. Similarly, one should purify **Vyatikrama**, etc., of knowledge, and **Atikrama**, etc., of perception and conduct. 1. **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 6, **Sū** 489 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 8, **Sū** 605 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 9, **Sū** 688 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 10, **Sū** 733 / There are five **Parāṃcik**-penance worthy transgressions: 1. One who creates discord among those in the same lineage (**gaccha**). 2. One who creates discord among those in the same group (**gaṇa**). 3. One who is inclined towards violence. 4. One who is a fault-finder. 5. One who repeatedly uses the **praśnaśāstra**. - **Ṭhāgaṃ** 5, **U** 1 **Sū** 398 / There are three **Parāṃcik**-penance worthy transgressions: 1. **Duṣṭa** **Parāṃcik** 2. **Pramatta** **Parāṃcik** 3. **Anyo'nya** **Maithanasevī** **Parāṃcik** / For specific knowledge regarding **Anvasthāpya** and **Parāṃcik** penance, one should refer to the **Vyavahāra Bhāṣya**. 2. (a) **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 3 **U** 4 **Sū** 195 / (b) To resolve to study during the time of non-study is **Atikrama** of knowledge / To go to get a book is **Vyatikrama** of knowledge / To begin studying is **Atichāra** of knowledge. To complete the study is **Anāchāra** of knowledge. Similarly, one should understand **Atikrama**, etc., of perception and conduct. [29]

## Ten Types of Consumption (Pratisevna)

1. **Darp Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food with ego.
2. **Pramad Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to five types of negligence (like sleepiness).
3. **Anabhog Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food unwillingly due to forgetfulness.
4. **Pratur Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food during illness.
5. **Apatti Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to reasons like famine.
6. **Sankit Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food with doubt.
7. **Sahsaakar Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food suddenly or forcefully.
8. **Bhay Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to fear.
9. **Pravas Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to hatred.
10. **Vimarsh Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food for testing a disciple.

These types of consumption are broadly classified into two: **Dapika** and **Kalpika**.

**Dapika Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food with attachment and aversion. The consumer becomes **viraadhak** (one who hinders spiritual progress).

**Kalpika Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food without attachment and aversion, or consumption that happens due to circumstances. The consumer becomes **araadhak** (one who helps spiritual progress).

## Six Types of Knowledge Transgression (Jnana Atichaar)

1. **Kala Atichaar:** Studying scriptures at an inappropriate time.
2. **Vinaya Atichaar:** Not respecting the teacher's instructions due to pride in one's caste or lineage while studying scriptures.
3. **Bahuman Atichaar:** Not respecting the scriptures and the teacher.
4. **Upadhana Atichaar:** Engaging in activities like scratching or applying ointment while reciting scriptures.
5. **Nihnava Abhidhana Atichaar:** Hiding the teacher's name.
6. **Vyanjana Atichaar:** Pronouncing more or fewer syllables than required.
7. **Artha Atichaar:** Not understanding the meaning of the scriptures in context, or understanding it in a contrary way.
8. **Ubhaya Atichaar:** Pronouncing short vowels as long and long vowels as short, or pronouncing high tones as low and low tones as high.

**Atikram, Vyatikrama, and Atichaar** are three types of transgressions that arise from the influence of the three passions (sanjvalana kshaya). They are purified through various types of atonement, starting from **Aalocana** (self-reflection) and ending with **Tapoham** (intense penance).

**Chhed, Mula, Anvasthapy, and Paranchik** are four types of transgressions that are eligible for atonement. They arise from the influence of the remaining twelve passions (Anantanubandhi 4, Apratyakhyani 4, Pratyakhyani 4).

---------------------------
There are four types of श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ who consume the four types of faults: अतिक्रम, व्यतिक्रम, अतिचार and अनाचार, which are both manifest and concealed. 

1. Some श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ consume these faults openly, without concealing them.
2. Some श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ consume these faults in a concealed manner, without revealing them.
3. Some श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ consume these faults both openly and in a concealed manner.
4. Some श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ do not consume these faults either openly or in a concealed manner.

Those who fall under the first category are श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ who are not disciplined, are undisciplined, free-willed, deceitful, and shameless. They are not afraid of sin and therefore consume faults openly.

Those who fall under the second category are of two types:

* श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ with a clear understanding, if they occasionally consume these faults, they do so in a concealed manner. This is because they consume faults due to their own weakness, and they think that if others see them consuming faults, they will also consume faults. Therefore, they consume faults in a concealed manner.
* श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ with a unclear understanding, who are deceitful, do not consume these faults openly out of fear of public shame or out of the desire to maintain the faith of the devotees in them. Instead, they consume them in secret.

Those who fall under the third category are श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ who are deceitful in nature. They consume ordinary faults openly, but they consume powerful faults in a concealed manner. If someone sees them consuming ordinary faults, they say, "Ordinary faults are common to everyone in this world. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid these faults."

Those who fall under the fourth category are श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ who are truly detached, seekers of liberation, and devoted to self-study. Therefore, they do not consume these faults either openly or in a concealed manner.

The प्रायश्चित्त-विधान (penance) prescribed in the व्यवहारसूत्र (practical rules) is for the purification of the faults consumed by the first three categories of श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ. The last category of श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ are the keepers of the निरतिचार चारित्र (faultless conduct), and therefore there is no provision for any kind of penance for them.

The व्यवहारशुद्धि (purification of conduct) is both difficult and easy. In the धर्मशासन (religious teachings) of the first Tirthankara, Bhagwan ऋषभदेव आदिनाथ, श्रमण-श्रमणियाँ were mostly straightforward and simple, but they were also dull (with limited intellectual development). Therefore, they were unable to fully understand and follow the समाचारी (conduct) prescribed in the sūtras (texts). This was the only reason why their व्यवहारशुद्धि was difficult to achieve. 

Page #33:
---------------------------
The 22 Tirthankaras (from Bhagwan Ajitanatha to Bhagwan Parshvanatha) and their Shraman-Shramani were mostly righteous and wise (simple and enlightened). They were always striving to have complete knowledge and complete adherence to the principles laid down in the Sutras. Therefore, their conduct was very simple. The Shraman-Shramani of the last Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira, are mostly crooked and dull. Even though they have detailed knowledge of the Shruta, including Dasha, Kalpa, and Vyavahar, each Gachchha presents a different interpretation of the principles. The observance of great religious festivals like Paryushana Parva and Samvatsari Parva, Pakkhi, and Chaumasi Alochana are also performed on different days. Due to their crookedness and dullness, they do not readily criticize the transgressions that occur in the Mulaguna and Uttargana. Therefore, their conduct is very difficult to purify. 

Palochana and Alochak: Alochana is the act of revealing transgressions (which occur due to ignorance, ego, carelessness, or circumstances) to the Guru. An Alochak is one who reveals the transgressions that have occurred due to the aforementioned reasons to the Guru. If the Alochak is deceitful and performs Palochana deceitfully, then he will not receive good results from the Alochana. If the Alochak is not deceitful and performs Alochana without deceit, then he will receive good results from the Alochana. 

It is essential to criticize transgressions for the purification of conduct and the purification of the self (Atma). However, there are different categories of seekers. One category does not criticize transgressions at all. They say, "We have committed transgressions (Akruti), we are committing them, and we will continue to commit them. Because the country, time, and physical-mental conditions are such that our disciplined life cannot be free from transgressions. It is not possible for us, so what is the benefit of Alochana? It is like the process of bathing an elephant. Transgressions occur, we criticize them, and then transgressions occur again. This cycle continues." Their thinking is unwise because if we wear clothes, we wear them, and we will continue to wear them, then the clothes we wear are soiled, they are soiled, and they will continue to be soiled. Then what is the benefit of purifying the clothes? How can this be considered appropriate? As long as we wear clothes, it is our duty to keep them clean. Because there are many benefits to purifying clothes - clothes that are purified daily do not become soiled, and clean clothes also contribute to good health. 

Similarly, as long as the activities of the Yogas are present and the Kshayas are intense or mild, the accumulation of Karmic dirt due to transgressions is certain.

Page #34:
---------------------------
Constantly criticizing transgressions does not purify the soul from karmic impurities and keeps it in a state of emotional distress. As the practice of yoga is obstructed and the passions become weaker, the occurrence of transgressions becomes less frequent. The second category is those who do not criticize transgressions out of fear of disgrace, reproach, censure, or condemnation, or out of fear of losing fame, reputation, or worship and respect. The third category is those who criticize but do so hypocritically. They think, "If I don't criticize, my present life will be ruined and my future life will also be miserable. If I criticize, my present and future life will be prosperous, or if I criticize, I will attain knowledge, vision, and good conduct." The scriptures prescribe double penance for hypocritical critics. The fourth category is those who criticize without hypocrisy. They are: 1. well-born, 2. of noble lineage, 3. humble, 4. knowledgeable, 5. insightful, 6. virtuous, 7. forgiving, 8. self-controlled, 9. free from attachment, 10. free from regret. This is the category of such seekers. Their conduct and conviction are both pure. Whether the critic is a seeker of liberation or not, they should always criticize in front of a seeker of liberation. In the absence of a seeker of liberation, in front of whom should they criticize? There is a sequence for this, which can be known by studying the Chhedasutras. Why is the editing of the Vyavaharsutra the ultimate goal of the life of restrained souls? - "Purity of conviction," that is, complete liberation of the soul (from karmic impurities), and for this, the purity of conduct prescribed by the Vyavaharsutra is essential. Just as physical health requires purification of the stomach, and purification of the stomach requires purification of food, similarly, spiritual well-being requires purity of conviction, and purity of conviction requires purity of conduct. Because without purity of conduct, purity of conviction is absolutely impossible. In worldly life, transactions are conducted only with those who are honest (in giving and taking money). Similarly, in spiritual life, actions like worship and veneration are performed only with a seeker of pure conduct. 1.

The conduct of restrained souls is purified (free from the stain of sin arising from transgression) by the five conducts expounded in the Vyavahar Sutra. Some thoughts have been expressed for the Chhed Sutras published in the Granth. In this writing, I have included essential excerpts from the Ayara Dasha, Kappasuttam Chhed Sutras edited by me earlier, Pandit Ratna Muni Shri Vijaymuniji Shastri's "Prachar Dasha: An Exercise" and Upadhyay Muni Shri Phoolchandji 'Shraman's "Brihat Kalpasutra Ki Uththanika". For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to both the Munis. The work of writing detailed discussions etc. has been done by Shri Tilockmuniji M.

## Introduction: Three Chhed Sutras: A Critical Study

The place of the Vedas in the Vedic tradition, the Tripitaka in the Buddhist tradition, the Bible in Christianity, and the Quran in Islam is the same as that of the Agam literature in the Jain tradition. The significant difference between the Vedas and the Buddhist and Jain Agam literature is that the sages of the Vedic tradition emphasized the protection of words, while the Jain and Buddhist traditions emphasized the meaning. This is why the words of the Vedas have been largely preserved, but they have not been able to establish a consensus on meaning. The Jain and Buddhist traditions have been completely opposite in this regard. There, the protection of meaning has been emphasized, and meaning has been considered more important than words. This is why there are variations in the texts of the Agams, but there is rarely a difference in meaning. The words of the Vedas have been imbued with mantras, which has preserved the words but destroyed their meaning. The Jain Agam literature, not being imbued with mantra power, has preserved the meaning completely. The Vedas do not represent the views of any particular sage, while the Jain Ganipitaka and the Buddhist Tripitaka represent the words of Lord Mahavira and the Tathagata Buddha respectively. The Tirthankaras have been the formulators of the meaning of the Jain Agams, and the Ganadharas have been the authors of the Sutras. The culture of the Jain and Vedic traditions has been distinct. The folk culture is primarily spiritual. The Jain Agams have primarily resonated with a spiritual tone, while the Vedas have expressed a worldly tone. It should not be forgotten that the things mentioned in the Jain Agams about atomic science, biology, botany, etc., two thousand five hundred years ago, are still astonishing to scientists today. The Jain Agam... literature has been important from many perspectives. Some time ago, the Western and Eastern scholars believed that the Vedas were the original source of the Agams and the Tripitaka, but the ruins found in the excavations of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa have radically changed the scholars' belief that the culture that existed in India before the arrival of the Aryans was fully developed and it was a Shraman culture. Impartial thinkers have unanimously accepted the fact that the Vedic tradition has accepted the five great vows of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession due to the influence of the Shraman culture. Today, the Vedic...

The description of ahimsa and other principles in tradition is a contribution of Jain culture. The word 'Agam' has many meanings. I have discussed it in detail. In Acharang, the word 'Pagam' is used in the sense of knowing. "Agametta-Anavizza"2 means to know and be wise. One who knows the brevity of Agam is called 'Laghavanga Agammane'. In Vyavahar Bhashya, Sanghadasagani, while describing Pragam-Vyavahar, has divided it into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct includes Avadhi, Manaparyav and Keval knowledge, and indirect includes fourteen previous and lesser Shruta knowledge. This also makes it clear that knowledge is Pragam. The teachings given by the omniscient and all-seeing Tirthankaras are also Pragam because they are knowledge. In Bhagavati, Anuyogadwar and Sthanang, the word Pragam is used in the sense of scripture. There, four types of evidence are mentioned: Pratyaksha, Anuman, Upaman and Pragam. Pragam is also divided into two categories: Laukik and Lokottar. Laukik Pagam includes Bharat, Ramayana etc., and Lokottar Pagam includes Achar, Sutrakrut etc. Lokottar Agam is also divided into three categories: Suttagam, Aththagam and Tadubhayagam. From another perspective, there are three types of Agam: Pratmagam, Anantaragam and Paramparagam. There are two types of Agam: Arthrup and Sutrap. Tirthankar Prabhu teaches Arthrup Pragam, hence Arthrup Gram is called Pratmagam of Tirthankaras, because it is their own Arthagam, they have not taken it from anyone else, but the same Arthagam has been received by the Ganadharas from the Tirthankaras. There is no interference of any third person between Ganadhar and Tirthankar, hence for Ganadharas, that Arthagam is called Anantaragam, but based on that Arthagam, Ganadharas themselves create Sutra-rup. Therefore, Sutragam is called Pratmagam for Ganadharas. The direct disciples of Ganadharas receive Sutragam directly from Ganadharas, there is no interference between them. Therefore, for those disciples, Sutragam is Anantaragam, but Arthagam is Paramparagam. Because they received it from their Dharma Guru Ganadharas. But this was not Pratmagam for Ganadharas. They received it from Tirthankaras. The disciples of Ganadharas and 1. Four Chapters of Culture: p. 125 - Ramdhari Singh "Dinakar" 2. Pracharang 124 Jnatva Prajnapayet 3.

When a woman can attain the highest spiritual position of a Tirthankara, and can acquire Kevalgyan, then scholars should contemplate with an impartial perspective on the weaknesses pointed out for the study of Drashtivad, and the weaknesses due to which women were not considered eligible for Drashtivad. In my view, the knowledge of the previous literature was attainable. To acquire that knowledge, only study and reading were not enough, some specific practices were also mandatory for the seeker. For those practices, the seeker had to stay alone in a secluded and peaceful place for some time. The physical body of women is not such that they can stay alone in seclusion and perform long practices. From this perspective, the study of Drashtivad was prohibited for women. This is more rational and logical. In my view, this is also the reason for the non-availability of the Aharaksharir of women. Based on the Anga texts compiled by the Ganadharas, other sthaviras later created texts, which are called Angabahya. Anga and Angabahya, these Agam texts are the fundamental pillars of the reign of Bhagwan Mahavir. They are the key to Jain practice, the unique treasure of Jain thought, the dignity of people's culture, and the glory of Jain literature. It should be remembered that the process of including Angabahya texts in the Agam has not been the same in both the Svetambar and Digambar traditions. In the Digambar tradition, the number of Angabahya Agams is very small, but in the Svetambars, this tradition continued for a long time, which resulted in a larger number of Angabahya texts. It is very important that the various studies of Praavasyak, Dashavkalik, Uttaradhyayanasutra, and Nishita, etc., are equally accepted in both traditions. The Svetambar scholars believe that the original form of Agam literature has been lost to a great extent, but not completely, it still remains. In the three compilations of Angas and Angabahya Bhagams, there has definitely been some change in its original form. Later events and deliberations have also been included. For example, the description of seven Nihnvas and Navaganas in the Stananga. The subject hinted at in the Prashnavyakaran is not available at present, however, most of the Agams are original, completely original. From the perspective of language and style of writing, it is very ancient. Present-day linguists consider the first Shrutaskandha of Acharanga and the first Shrutaskandha of Sutrakrutanga to be two thousand five hundred years old. They also consider Stananga, Bhagavati, Uttaradhyayanasutra, Dashavkalik, Nishita, and Kalpa to be ancient. There is no doubt that the original of the Pragam is still preserved. From the perspective of the Digambar tradition, Anga literature has been lost. Therefore, they created new texts and considered them as evidence like Agams. The Digambar tradition does not consider the Pragam literature of the Svetambars as evidence, and the Svetambar tradition does not consider the texts of the Digambar tradition as valid, but when I contemplate with an impartial perspective, it is clear that there is no significant difference in the original perspective of the Pragam texts of both traditions. The philosophical views, Jivavichar, Karmavichar, Lokavichar, Gyanavichar are the same in both the Pragam texts. There is no difference from a philosophical perspective. Even if we contemplate from the perspective of the practice tradition, there is no significant difference, even though there is some difference of opinion regarding the use of clothes. In the texts of the Digambar tradition, nudity has been emphasized, but in practice, the number of naked monks has been very few, and the number of Digambar Bhattarakas, etc.

The Jain Kalpa was given more importance than the Stavira Kalpa in the Svetambara Pragama literature, but from a practical point of view, it was prohibited after the Aryajambhu. The Digambara tradition prohibits women from attaining liberation, but the Digambara tradition-accepted Shatkhandagama states that human women are adequately present in the Samyagmithyadristi, Asanyatasamyagdristi, Sanyatasanyata, and Sanyata Gunasthanas. In this, the word "Sanjad" has been given in the commentary by the editors, the gist of which is that a human woman cannot be in the "Sanyata" Gunasthan, and if she is in the Sanyata Gunasthan, then she can attain liberation. A strong atmosphere of opposition arose in the Digambara community regarding the present question, then the editors of the text, Pandit Heerlalji Jain, etc., again explained it in the "Preface to the Third Part of the Pakhandagama", but when the scholars saw the original copy of the Pakhandagama in Moodbidri (Karnataka), they also found the word "Sanjad" in it. Vadkar Swami, in his Mulachar, while analyzing the conduct of the Prayikas, has said that the Sadhus or Dharayikas who conduct themselves in this way attain worship, fame, and happiness in the world and attain liberation. This also mentions the Prayikas attaining liberation. But later, the commentators prohibited women's liberation in their commentaries. Of all the rules of conduct, the most important rule is that of Uddishta Tyaga, which has been equally important in both traditions. In the Svetambara Pragama literature and its explanatory literature, there is a special description of the exceptional path regarding conduct, but there is no description of the exception in the Digambara tradition, but on deep reflection, it appears that there must have been exceptions in the Digambara tradition as well, if there were no exceptions from the beginning, then how would the name of Nishita come in the Angavahy list? In the Svetambara tradition, the study of exceptions has been prohibited for every individual by codifying them. Only a Shraman with special qualifications is considered eligible to read them. The number of Svetambara Shramans has been very high from the beginning, which led to the creation of Chhedasutras for the smooth functioning of society. The Chhedasutras explain the hidden secrets and subtle activities of Shramanachar. Many favorable and unfavorable situations arise in the life of a Shraman, the Chhedasutras tell how to make decisions in such difficult situations. The description of rules and sub-rules regarding conduct, as is available in the Chhedasutras in the Jain tradition, is also found in the Vinayapitaka in the Buddhist tradition and in the Kalpasutra, Shrotasutra, and Grihasutras in the Vedic tradition. There were also Chhedasutras in the Digambara tradition, but they are not available today. The Chhedasutra is not mentioned in the Mandisutra. The first use of "Chhed Sutra" is in Praavshak Niyukti 16.

It is green. 18 After that, this word has also been used in *VisheshAvashyakBhashya* and *NishithBhashya*. The implication is that if we consider *AvashyakNiyukti* to be the work of the brother of the astrologer Varahamihira, the second Bhadrabaahu, then he lived in the sixth century Vikram. He has used it. It is clear that the word "Chhedasutta" was used before "Mulasutta". Why were certain *Pragamas* given the name "Chhedasutra"? The answer to this question is not directly and clearly available in ancient texts. However, it is clear that the sutras that have been called "Chhedasutta" are *Prayashchitta* sutras. In *Sthananga*, five *charitras* are mentioned for the *Shramanas* (1) *Samayik*, (2) *Chhedopasthapaniya*, (3) *PariharVishuddhi*, (4) *SookshmaSamparaya*, (5) *Yayakhyata* / 22 Of these, the last three *charitras* have been discontinued in the present time. The *Samayik* *charitra* is short-lived, the *Chhedopasthapanik* *charitra* lasts for life. *Prayashchitta* is also related to this *charitra*. It is possible that the *Prayashchitta* sutras were given the name *Chhedasutra* keeping this *charitra* in mind. In *Malayagiri*’s *AvashyakVritti* 23, the term *pad-vibhaga*, *samachari* has been used for *Chhedasutras*. Both the words *pad-vibhaga* and *Chhed* have been kept. Because in *Chhedasutras*, one sutra is not connected to another sutra. All the sutras are independent. Their interpretation is also done from the *Chhed-drishti* or *vibhaga-drishti*. *DashaShrutaSkandha*, *Nishith*, *Vyavahar* and *BrihatKalpa* these sutras have been quoted from the ninth *Pratyakhyana* before, 24 they have been given the name *Chhedasutra* by cutting them off, i.e., separating them, this is also possible / 25 *Chhedasutras* have been considered as the best *Shruta*. The *Bhashyakaras* also support this statement. 26 *Chanikara* Jinadas Mahत्तर himself raises the question that why are *Chhedasutras* the best? Then he himself solves it by saying that the *Prayashchitta* method is described in the *sutra*, it purifies the *charitra*, for this reason this *Shruta* is considered the best. 18. *Jan cha Mahakappasuyam, jani asesani Chheasuttani / Charanakarananuprago ti kaliyatthe uvamyani / / -AvashyakNiyukti 777 -VisheshAvashyakBhashya 2265 20.

It has gone. A comprehensive discussion of the practice of the Shraman life is available only in the Cheda Sutras. What are the limitations of the seeker, what is his duty? Such questions have been pondered upon in them. To cut out the element of unrestraint from life, to cleanse the practice of its impurities, to be fully vigilant to avoid mistakes, to take atonement and rectify them if mistakes are made, all this is the work of the Cheda Sutras. / In Samachari Shatak, Time Sundargani has stated the number of Cheda Sutras to be six: (1) Mahanishith, (2) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (3) Vyavahar, (4) Brihat Kalp, (5) Nishith, (6) Jit Kalp / Except for Jit Kalp, the names of the remaining five Sutras are also found in Nandi Sutra. Jit Kalp is the work of Jinbhadragani Kshamasraman, therefore it cannot be placed in the category of Agam. / The present version of Mahanishith is a restoration by Acharya Haribhadra (8th century AD). It had been consumed by termites before that. Therefore, the Mahanishith available today also does not find a place in the category of Agam. Thus, there are only four original Cheda Sutras - (1) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (2) Vyavahar, (3) Brihat Kalp and (4) Nishith / The Jain Agams have been created in two ways (1) Krit, (2) Ni! Hit / The Agams that have been created independently are called Krit Agams. For example, the Dvadasangi was created by the Ganadharas and the Upanga literature was created by different sthaviras, they are all Krit Pagams. Ni! Hit Agams are considered to be - (1) Acharachula (2) Dashakalik (3) Nishith (4) Dasha Shruta Skandha (5) Brihat Kalp (6) Vyavahar (7) Uttaradhyayanas's Parisha Adhyayan. Acharachula has been elaborated by Chaturdashapurvi Bhadrabahu, this fact has become clear through investigation today. The style of Acharachula is completely different from that of Acharang. It was created after Acharang. The Acharang-Niyuktikar has considered it to be sthavir. The meaning of sthavir has been given as Ganadhar by Charnikar. 1. Cheyasuyam kamha uttamasuttam?

And the commentator has done the fourteen पूर्वी, but the name of the स्थविर has not come in them. The opinion of the learned is that the word स्थविर here is used for the fourteen पूर्वी भद्रबाहु. To express the profound meaning of the आचारांग, the "आचारचूला" has been created. The commentator has indicated the निर्यहूणस्थल of the five चूला. The दशवकालिक fourteen पूर्वी शय्यंभव has been नि!हण by the various पूर्वो. For example, the fourth study is taken from the आत्मप्रवाद पूर्व, the fifth study from the कर्मप्रवाद पूर्व, the seventh study from the सत्यप्रवाद पूर्व, and the remaining studies are taken from the third वस्तु of the प्रत्याख्यान पूर्व. According to the second opinion, the दशवकालिक गणिपिटक is quoted from the द्वादशांगी. The निशीथ has been नि!हण from the ninth पूर्व called प्रत्याख्यान. The प्रत्याख्यान पूर्व has twenty वस्तु, i.e., अर्थाधिकार. The name of the third वस्तु is आचार. It also has twenty प्राभृतच्छेद, i.e., subdivisions. The निशीथ has been नि'हण from the twentieth प्राभूतच्छेद. According to the पंचकल्पचूणि, the निर्यु हक of निशीथ is भद्रबाहुस्वामी. This opinion has also been supported by the प्रागमप्रभावक मुनिश्री पुण्यविजयजी. 1.

"The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Brihat-Kalpa and Vyavahar, all three are considered to be abridged versions of the original fourteen Purvas by Bhadra-Bahu Swami. According to the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha's own statement, the currently available Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is shorter than the original Dasha-Shruta-Skandha found in the Angas. This abridgment was done by the Sthaviras for the benefit of their disciples. According to the Churni, the name of the Sthavira is Bhadra-Bahu.

The second study of the Uttaradhyayanas is also considered to be an Anga-Prabhava. According to Bhadra-Bahu, the author of the abridgment, it is an excerpt from the seventeenth Prabhrit of the Karma-Pravada-Purva. In addition to these, a large part of the extra-Anga literature, especially the Karma literature, is considered to be abridged from the original.

It is important to clarify the meaning of the term "niyuhita" (abridged) in relation to these works. The Tirthankaras are the ones who provide the essence of the meaning, the Sutrakara (author of the Sutras) is Ganadhara, and the ones who are credited with the current abridged form are the ones whose names are inscribed or known. For example, the author of the Dasha-Kalika is Shayambhava, and the author of the Kalpa, Vyavahar, Nishita and Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is Bhadra-Bahu.

Both the Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the number of Jain Anga literature. They both accept twelve Angas. However, this is not the case with the number of extra-Anga Agamas, as they have different opinions. Some consider the number of Agamas to be 84, some 45, and some 32. The list of Agamas given in the Nandi-Sutras does not include all the Agamas that are currently available. The Svetambara Murtipujak community considers 45 Agamas, including some abridgments along with the original Agamas, while some consider 84. The Stanakvasi and Terapanthi traditions consider only 32 to be authoritative. The Digambara community believes that all the original Agamas have been lost.

The Dasha Shruta Skandha is a Cheda Sutra. The Cheda Sutra has two functions: to protect from faults and to provide atonement for faults committed inadvertently. It contains provisions for avoiding faults. In the Thananga, it is known as Prachar Dasha. The Dasha Shruta Skandha has ten studies, hence its name. The Dasha Shruta Skandha has 1830 Anushtup Shlokas in the available text. It has 216 Gadyasutras and 52 Padya Sutras. The first Uddeshak describes 20 Asamadhi Sthanas. Samadhi is the state of mind that is peaceful and remains on the path of liberation through knowledge, vision, and conduct. Asamadhi is the state of mind that is disturbed and restless, and leads the soul away from the path of liberation through knowledge, vision, and conduct. There are twenty types of Asamadhi. These include: walking quickly, walking at night without worship, performing bodily functions without purpose, disrespecting elders, and slander. These actions lead to Asamadhi in oneself and other beings. The seeker's soul becomes polluted and their pure conduct becomes tainted. Therefore, they are called Asamadhi Sthanas. The second Uddeshak describes 21 Shabala Doshas, which destroy the purity of conduct. When conduct becomes impure, it becomes tainted. Therefore, they are called Shabala Doshas. The word "Shabala" means "colored". Shabala Doshas include: masturbation, touching women, eating and performing actions at night, being a Pradhakarmi, consuming food for a specific purpose, breaking a vow, and consuming Maya Sthanas. Conduct becomes Shabala by committing four faults in the Uttargunas, and three faults in the Mulagunas, in addition to Anachar. The third Uddeshak describes 33 types of Ashatanas. The Jain Acharyas have given a beautiful explanation of the word Ashatana. The attainment of spiritual qualities like Samyag Darshan is called "Aaya" and "Shatana" means "destruction". Disrespecting great men like Sadgurudev leads to the destruction of good qualities like Samyag Darshan. The thirty-three types of Ashatanas include: walking, standing, or sitting in front of the Guru, in the same row, or very close to the Guru; speaking to someone else before the Guru; disregarding the Guru's words; not criticizing after returning from begging; and so on. The fourth Uddeshak describes the eight types of Ganisampadas. A community of Shramans is called a Gan. The head of the Gan is called the Gani. The eight types of Ganisampadas are: Prachar Sampada, Shruta Sampada, Sharira Sampada, Vachan Sampada, Vachana Sampada, Mati Sampada, Prayogmati Sampada, and Sangrahparijnan Sampada. The four types of Prachar Sampada are: being virtuous and disciplined, being free from ego, being of unsteady nature, and being of old nature (unchanging nature).

The **Shruta Sampada** has four types: **Bahushruta**, **Parichita Shruta**, **Vichitra Shruta**, and **Ghosh Vishuddhikarakta**. The **Sharira Sampada** has four types: **Samyak Anupat** (proper proportion of height and width of the body), **Alajjaspad Sharira** (a body that is not shameful), **Sthir Sangathan** (stable organization), and **Pratipoorna Indriyata** (complete senses). The **Vachan Sampada** has four types: **Pradeyavachan** (speech that is worthy of being received), **Madhur Vachan** (sweet speech), **Anishrit** (unrestricted), and **Asandhight Vachan** (unambiguous speech). The **Vachana Sampada** has four types: **Vicharpoork Vachya Vishay Ka Uddeshya Nirdeshan** (purposeful direction of the subject matter of speech), **Vicharpoork Vachan** (purposeful speech), **Upayukt Vishay Ka Hi Vivechan** (discussion of only the appropriate subject), and **Arth Ka Sunishchit Roop Se Nirupan** (definite representation of meaning). The **Mati Sampada** has four types: **Avgrah**, **Iha**, **Avay**, and **Dharana**.

**Avgrah** has six types: **Kshipragrahan** (quick grasping), **Bahuggrahan** (grasping many things), **Bahuviggrahan** (grasping many different things), **Dhravgrahan** (firm grasping), **Anishritgrahan** (unrestricted grasping), and **Asandhightgrahan** (unambiguous grasping). Similarly, **Iha** and **Avay** also have six types each. **Dharana** has six types: **Bahudharan** (holding many things), **Bahubidhdharan** (holding many different things), **Puratanadharan** (holding old things), **Durddhardharan** (holding firmly), **Anidhidharan** (holding without being taught), and **Asandhightdharan** (holding unambiguously).

**Prayogmati Sampada** has four types: **Swayan Ki Shakti Ke Anusar Vad-Vivad** (debate according to one's own strength), **Parishad Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debate by looking at the assembly), **Kshetra Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debate by looking at the field), and **Kal Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debate by looking at the time).

**Sangrahparijna Sampada** has five types: **Varshakal Mein Sabhi Muniyon Ke Niwas Ke Liye Yogyasthan Ki Pareeksha** (examination of a suitable place for the residence of all monks during the rainy season), **Sabhi Shramanon Ke Liye Pratiharik Peet, Falak, Shayya, Sanstark Ki Vyavastha** (arrangement of seats, platforms, beds, and bedding for all ascetics), **Niyamit Samay Par Pratiyek Kary Karna** (doing every task at the appointed time), **Apne Se Jyest Shramanon Ka Satkar-Samman Karna** (honoring and respecting senior ascetics).

After describing the **Gani Sampada**, the text discusses **Chaturvidh Vinay-Pratipatti** (four types of acceptance of discipline) related to it. These are: **Achar Vinay**, **Shruta Vinay**, **Vikshepan Av Vinay**, and **Dosha Nirghat Vinay**. This **Chaturvidh Vinay-Pratipatti** is called **Guru Sambandhi Vinay-Pratipatti** (acceptance of discipline related to the teacher). Similarly, **Shishya Sambandhi Vinay-Pratipatti** (acceptance of discipline related to the student) has four types: **Upakaranotpadanta** (production of tools), **Sahayta** (assistance), **Varnasanjvalanta** (praise of qualities), and **Bharpratyavarohaanta** (reduction of burden). Each of these has four types again. Thus, the presented **Uddeshak** (chapter) analyzes a total of 32 types of **Vinay-Pratipatti**.

The fifth **Uddeshak** describes ten types of **Chitta Samadhi** (mental absorption). These are: **Dharma Bhavana** (feeling of Dharma), **Swapna Darshan** (dream vision), **Jati Smaran Gyan** (knowledge of past lives), **Dev Darshan** (vision of gods), **Avadhi Gyan** (clairvoyance), **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance), **Manah Paryavgyan** (knowledge of the minds of others), **Keval Gyan** (omniscience), **Keval Darshan** (omniscience), and **Kevalmaran** (Nirvana). The text also sheds light on the specific nature of **Mohaniya Karma** (karma that binds to the mind) along with the description of these ten stages.

The sixth **Uddeshak** describes eleven types of **Upasak Pratimaan** (models of devotees). Before describing the **Pratimaan**, the text depicts the nature of **Mithyadrishti** (wrong belief) and explains that it gives punishment without any consideration of justice or injustice. This includes: **Sampattiharan** (theft of property), **Mudan** (shaving), **Tarjan** (threatening), **Tadan** (beating), **Andukbandhan** (binding with a rope), **Nigadbandhan** (binding with chains), **Kasthbandhan** (binding with wood), **Charakbandhan** (imprisonment), **Nigadyugal Sankutan** (binding limbs together), **Hast, Pad, Karn, Nasika, Ashth, Shirsha, Mukh, Ved Adi Ka Chhedan** (cutting of hands, feet, ears, nose, teeth, head, mouth, and Vedas), **Hriday-Utpatana** (extraction of the heart), **Nayanadi Utpatana** (extraction of eyes), **Ullamban** (hanging from a tree), **Gharshan** (rubbing), **Gholan** (mixing), **Shulaayan** (hanging on a spike), **Shulabhedan** (piercing with a spike), **Ksharavartan** (sprinkling salt on wounds), **Darbavartan** (causing pain with grass), **Singhpuchan** (lion's tail), **Vrushabhpuchan** (bull's tail), **Davaagnidagdhan** (burning with fire), **Bhaktapananirodh** (stopping food and water), etc. It experiences joy by giving such punishments. But **Samyagdristi** (right belief) is **Praastik** (believing in the existence of the soul) and becomes a **Upasak** (devotee) and practices the eleven **Pratimaan**. These eleven **Upasak Pratimaan** have already been described in **Upasakdasang**.

Some preceptors believe that a lay follower who has completed the pratima (ritual) takes sannyasa (renunciation). It is mentioned that Kartik Seth had taken the pratima 100 times. The seventh uddeśaka (chapter) describes the pratima of the śramaṇa (ascetic). These are 12 types of pratima for monks. The first pratima-dhari (one who performs the pratima) monk is allowed to take one datti (gift) of food and one datti of water. The datti is the continuous flow of food and water given by the donor to the śramaṇa. It is allowed to take food from a place where food is prepared for one person. It is not allowed to take food from a place where food is prepared for two, three, or more people. The duration of this pratima is one month. The second pratima is also for one month. In this, two datti of food and two datti of water are taken. Similarly, in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh pratima, three, four, five, six, and seven datti of food and the same amount of datti of water are taken respectively. Each pratima lasts for one month. Only due to the increase in datti, they are called trimasik (three months), caturmasik (four months), pancmasik (five months), shaḍmasik (six months), and saptamasik (seven months) respectively. The eighth pratima is for seven days and nights. In this, one has to observe a four-meal fast (caturvihar). One has to stand facing the sky outside the village, lie on one side, and sit in viṣadyāsana (with legs straight) and endure any upsarga (illness) with a calm mind. The ninth pratima is also for seven nights. In this, the four meals are taken separately (bele-bele). One has to meditate in a secluded place outside the village in daṇḍāsana, laghuḍāsana, or utkaṭakāsana. The tenth pratima is also for seven nights. In this, the four meals are taken separately (tele-tele). One has to meditate outside the village in godohāsana, vīrāsana, and āmrākubjāsana. The eleventh pratima is for one day and night. Its practice is done until the fourth prahar (watch). The four meals are taken separately (caturvihar). One has to stand outside the city with both hands stretched towards the knees like a staff and perform kāyoatsarga (relaxation of the body). The twelfth pratima is for only one night. Its practice is done with tele (oil). One has to stand outside the village in the cremation ground, slightly bending the head, focusing on one particle, and performing kāyoatsarga with closed eyes with certainty. One has to endure any upsarga with equanimity. There are many rules for the śramaṇa who is in these pratima. For example, if a person is a pratima-dhari nirgrantha (one who has renounced all possessions), then he should take alms in three parts - ādi (beginning), madhya (middle), and charma (end). One should not go for alms in the middle and end parts after going for alms in the beginning part. A śramaṇa who is in a monthly pratima can stay for one night where he is known. He can stay for two nights where he is not known. If he stays for more than that, he has to perform a penance of the same number of days or perform tapas (austerities). Similarly, other strict rules can be imposed. For example, if someone sets fire to the upāśraya (shelter), he should not go there. If someone tries to pull him out by force, he should not resist but should carefully come out. Similarly, if a mad elephant, horse, bull, dog, tiger, etc. comes in front of him, he should not take a step back out of fear. He should patiently endure cold and heat. The eighth uddeśaka (chapter) describes the paryushana kalpa (ritual). The word paryushana is derived from the prefix "pari" and the root "vas" [46] 

Page #48:
---------------------------
"Anaḥ" is a suffix used to form this word. It means self-immersion, self-delight, or being in one's own self. / The second meaning of Paryushana Kalpa is to reside in one place. It is of two types: Salamban and Nirāvalamban. Salamban means with a cause, and Nirāvalamban means without a cause. / Nirāvalamban has two divisions: Jghanya (inferior) and Utkrushta (superior). The synonyms of Paryushana are as follows: (1) Pariyāya Vatthavaṇā, (2) Pajjosamaṇā, (3) Pāgaiyā, (4) Parivasanā, (5) Pajjusanā, (6) Vāsāvāsa, (7) Padhamasamosaran, (8) Thavaṇā, and (9) Jetthoggha. All these names have the same meaning, but there is a slight difference in meaning based on the difference in etymology. This difference in meaning demonstrates the importance of various traditions related to Paryushana and the actions performed during that specific time. / These meanings also reveal some historical facts. / The seniority and juniority of Dikshaparaya are calculated based on the Paryushana period. Paryushana period is considered a type of year count. Therefore, Paryushana is considered the cause of the state of Dikshaparaya. / During Varshavas, certain special actions related to different types of substances, fields, time, and emotions are performed. Therefore, Paryushana is also called Pajjosamaṇā. Third, because it is to be worshipped equally by householders and others, it is called "Pāgaiyā," meaning natural. During this fixed period, the seeker tries to stay closer to the soul, so it is also called Parivasanā. Paryushana also means service. During this period, the seeker serves and worships the qualities of the soul, such as knowledge and vision. Therefore, it is called Pajjusanā. In this Kalpa, the Shraman resides in one place for four months. Therefore, it is called Vāsāvāsa Varshavas. If there is no specific reason, entry into the area suitable for Chaturmas is made only during the rainy season (Pravrit). Therefore, it is called Prathamasamavasaran. / Its boundaries vary depending on the seasonal period. Therefore, it is called Thavaṇā (establishment). / There is a field acquisition for each month during the seasonal period, but for four months during the rainy season. Therefore, it is called Jetthoggha (Jyeshthaavagraha). If the Sadhu has arrived at the designated place by Ashadhi Purnima and declared Varshavas, then Varshavas begins from Shravan Krishna Panchami. If the suitable area is not found, then Varshavas should be started on Shravan Krishna Dashami. If a suitable area is still not found, then Varshavas should be started on Shravan Krishna Panchadashi-Amavasya. If a suitable area is not found even then, then it is considered mandatory to start Varshavas by Bhadrapad Shukla Panchami, increasing by five days each time. If a suitable area is not found even by this time, then Paryushana Kalpa should be performed under a tree. / However, this date should not be violated under any circumstances. The current Paryushana Kalpasutra is the eighth study of the Dasha Shruta Skandha. The oldest copies of Dasha Shruta Skandha, which are from before the fourteenth century, contain the complete Kalpasutra in the eighth study. This clearly proves that the Kalpasutra is not an independent work but the eighth study of the Dasha Shruta Skandha. / [47]

---------------------------
Secondly, the appointment of the second Bhadrabahu, which is mentioned in the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha and dates back to the sixth century BCE, provides an explanation for the terms used in the text. Muni Shri Punyavijayaji believes that the commentary on the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is approximately sixteen hundred years old. The first sutra of the Kalpa Sutra states, "Teṇam kāleṇam teṇam samaeṇam samaṇo bhagavā mahāvīre.............." and the last sutra states, "..............bhujjo bhujjo uvadamsei." The same text is found in the eighth uddeśaka [chapter] of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha. Here, the remaining text has been abbreviated under the word "jav." The text currently available only describes the Panch Kalyanak, which has no connection to the Paryushana Kalpa. Therefore, it is clear that the Paryushana Kalpa was the complete Kalpa Sutra in this study. The authors of both the Kalpa Sutra and the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha are Bhadrabahu. Therefore, since both are works of the same author, it can be said that the Kalpa Sutra is a textual study of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha. This is clearly evidenced by the commentary, churni, Prithvichandatippan, and other commentaries on the Kalpa Sutra. The ninth uddeśaka describes 30 maha-mohaniya (greatly deluding) places. The pudgala karmas (karmic particles) that bind the soul are called karmas. Mohaniya karma (deluding karma) is the most prominent among them. There is no limit to the causes of mohaniya karma bandha (binding of deluding karma), but the scriptural authors have mentioned thirty types of causes that lead to mohaniya karma bandha. Among them, the intensity and cruelty of durdhyavasa (stubbornness) are so great that sometimes maha-mohaniya karma is bound, causing the soul to wander in the world for 70 koṭi-koṭi sāgaropam (billions of billions of oceans). Acharya Haribhadra and Jinadasagani use only the word mohaniya. The Uttaradhyayanasutra, Samavayangasutra, and Dasha-Shruta-Skandha also refer to mohaniya sthana (deluding places). However, the word "mahamoham pakuvvai" (greatly deluding) is used in the description of the types. These places include drowning living beings in water, killing them by suffocating them, killing them by tying wet leather on their heads, engaging in illicit sex in secret, falsely accusing someone, claiming to be a celibate even though one is not, criticizing a Kevalajnani (omniscient), claiming to be a scholar even though one is not, practicing magic, repeatedly using sexually suggestive language, etc. The tenth uddeśaka is called "Ayati Sthana" (Place of Effort). It describes various nidanas (causes). Nidana means the resolution that arises from the desire for fulfillment due to the influence of delusion, which leads to the desire for objects like lust, etc. When desires arise in the human mind due to the strong influence of delusion, he makes a firm resolution to fulfill them. This particular resolution is nidana. Due to nidana, human desires continue to exist even in the future, preventing him from being liberated from the cycle of birth and death. From the perspective of future birth and death, this uddeśaka is called Prayati Sthana (Place of Effort). Prayati means birth or caste. It is considered Ayati Sthana because it is the cause of nidana. In other words, if "ti" is separated from Ayati, "pay" remains. Pray means benefit. The nidana that benefits birth and death is called Ayati. This chapter describes how Bhagavan Mahavira arrived in Rajagaha. King Shrenik and Queen Chelna arrived to pay their respects to the Bhagavan. Seeing the divine and magnificent form and great prosperity of King Shrenik, the Shramanas began to think, "Shrenik appears to be like a god himself. If we also have the fruits of our austerities, rules, and restraint, then we too can 1. Tisan moha-thanai-abhikkhanam-abhikkhanam ayaremane va samaayaremane va mohanijjatae kammam pakarei.

---------------------------
They wished to become like Chelna. Seeing the beautiful, radiant form and splendor of Queen Chelna, a resolve arose in the minds of the Shramanis that if their practice bore fruit, they would become like Chelna in their next birth. The Antaryami Mahavira knew their resolve and asked the Shramanas and Shramanis if such a resolve had arisen in their minds. They replied in affirmation, "Yes, Bhagavan! This is true." The Bhagavan said, "The Nirgrantha-Pravachana is the best, it is complete, it destroys all karmas. Those Shramanas or Shramanis who, turning away from Dharma, are attracted by splendor and other things and make Nidana, if they complete their lifespan without atonement, are born in the Devaloka and from there they are reborn in the Manavloka. Due to Nidana, they do not attain Kevali Dharma. They remain forever engrossed in worldly matters." The Shastrakar has described 9 types of Nidanas and explained that the Nirgrantha Pravachana is the only means to liberate from all karmas. Therefore, one should not make Nidana, and if one has made it, one should become free by doing Alochana-Prayaschitta. In conclusion, the biography of Bhagavan Mahavira is found in detail in the Pathvi Dasha of this Pragama. There is a beautiful description of Chittasamadhi and Dharma Chinta. There is also a description of the differences between Upasaka-Pratima and Bhikshu-Pratima. The Brihatkalpa has a glorious place in the Cheda Sutras. Like other Cheda Sutras, this Sutra also contemplates on the rules and prohibitions, Utsarga-Apabad, Tapas, Prayaschitta, etc. regarding the conduct of Shramanas. It has six Uddesakas, 81 Adhikars, and 473 Shlokas in the available original text. There are 206 Sutra numbers. The first Uddesaka has 50 Sutras. The first five Sutras are about Tal-Prlamb. It is forbidden for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to take Tal and Prlamb. It is stated that one should not take unripe Tal fruit and Tal root, but it is permissible to take split, ripe Tal-Prlamb, etc. The rules regarding Masakalpa state that Shramanas should stay in one place for a maximum time of 8 months during the Hemant and Grishma seasons. It is not permissible for Shramanas to stay together for more than one month in the following 16 types of places, except during the rainy season, with Parikshepa, i.e., with Prachira and outside the Prachira. 1. Gram [where 18 types of taxes are levied by the state] 2. Magar [where 18 types of taxes are not levied] 3. Khet [which has an earthen wall around it] 4. Karbat [where few people live] 5. Madamb [where there is no village for two and a half Kos] [49] 

Page #51:
---------------------------
6. Pattana [where all things are available] 7. Aakar [where all things are available] 8. Dronamukha [where there is a path connecting water and land, where sea goods are unloaded] 9. Nigam [where merchants reside] 10. Rajdhani [where the king's palace etc. are] 11. Prashram [where ascetics etc. live] 12. Nivesh Sannivesh [where merchants unload their goods] 13. Sambadh-Sambah [where farmers live or where people from other villages stay in mountains, caves etc. for the protection of their wealth etc. from their village] 14. Ghosh [where Gujar people-Gwalas who graze cows etc. live] 15. Anshika [half, third or fourth part of a village] 16. Putbhadan [where merchants of the village come to sell their goods]. They can stay inside and outside the city walls for one month each. While staying inside, they should take alms from inside and while staying outside, they should take alms from outside. Shramanis can stay inside for two months and outside for two months. Where there is only one gate of the city wall, Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are prohibited from staying together, but they can stay if there are many gates. Where there are many shops and many gates around the Upashraya, Sadhvis should not stay there, but Sadhu can stay there with effort. Where the place is completely open and there are no gates, Sadhvis should not stay there. If there is no Upashraya-place by way of exception, they can stay by putting up a curtain. Nirgranths are allowed to stay in an open place. Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are allowed to keep and use a mosquito net made of cloth. Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are not allowed to stand, sit, lie down, sleep, eat, drink, study etc. near a water body. Shraman-Shramanis are not allowed to stay where there are pictures that arouse passions. They are not allowed to stay without the permission of the house owner. Shraman-Shramanis should not stay in a house where there is a passage in the middle - where householders live. If there is a quarrel between an Acharya, Upadhyaya, Shraman or Shramani of a Shraman, they should apologize to each other. He who is calm is a worshiper. The essence of Shram Dharma is Upsham - "Uvasamsaram Samannam". Vihar is prohibited during Varshavas, but it is prescribed during Hemant and Grishma seasons. Nirgranth-Nirgranthis are prohibited from wandering repeatedly in unfavorable areas. Because there is a possibility of violation of restraint. Therefore, there is a provision for atonement. [50]

---------------------------
If a householder wishes to give clothes, vessels, blankets, etc. to a monk who has gone out for alms or for bodily needs, then the monk should take and keep them only after obtaining permission from the Acharya. Similarly, the permission of the Pravartini is necessary for the Dharmni. It is forbidden for monks and nuns to take food, etc. at night or at an inappropriate time. Similarly, it is forbidden to take clothes, vessels, blankets, and cleaning materials. As an exception, if a thief has stolen the clothes of monks and nuns and they have been recovered, they can be taken at night. If the clothes have been worn by thieves, cleaned, dyed, or perfumed with fragrant substances, they can also be taken. It is forbidden for Nirgranth and Nirgranthis to travel at night or at an inappropriate time. If it is necessary to go for Uccarabhumi, etc., as an exception, they should not go alone but should take Sadhus with them. The boundaries of the travel area for Nirgranth and Nirgranthis have been considered. In the past, the Aryakshetra extended from Angadesh and Magadhadesh in the east, to Kausambi in the south, to Sthuna in the west, and to Kunala in the north. Traveling in the Aryakshetra increases knowledge and vision. If there is no possibility of loss of the Ratna-tray by going to the Anaryakshetra, then one can go. In the second Uddeshak, 12 sutras on Upashraya have been explained. It has been stated that monks and nuns should not stay even for a short time in an Upashraya where rice, barley, green gram, black gram, etc. are scattered. However, if they are piled up in one place, it is permissible to stay there during the winter and summer seasons. If they are stored safely in a storehouse, etc., it is permissible to stay there even during the rainy season. Sadhus and Sadhvis should not stay even for a short time in a place where Suravikat, Sauviravikat, etc. are kept. If, due to circumstances, no other place is available even after searching, the monk can stay for two nights, but not more. Staying for more than that will result in the atonement of Chhed or Parihar. Similarly, one should not stay in an Upashraya that has a cold water well, a hot water well, a lamp, a lamp, etc. Similarly, one should not take food, etc. from the owner of one or more houses. If there is one main owner, then one can take from the rest. Here, the Shayatar is the main one whose permission has been taken. The various aspects of Shayatar have been considered. Nirgranth-Nirgranthis can take clothes in five ways: Jangik, Bhangik, Sanak, Potak, and Tiritpattak. 1.

---------------------------
It is permissible to have five types of "rajoharan": auṇik, prauṣṭrik, sānak, vaccakcipphak, and mūjccipphak. In the third uddeśaka, it is not permissible for nirgranthas to sit, sleep, eat, drink, study, meditate, or perform kayotsarga in the shelter of nirgranthis. Similarly, it is not permissible for nirgranthis to sit, eat, drink, etc. in the shelter of nirgranthas. The next four sūtras discuss the rules regarding clothing, consumption, etc. Regarding clothing, it is stated that they should not be colored, but should be white. The rules regarding what items to wear or not wear are laid out. The rules regarding clothing at the time of initiation are also described. It is forbidden to take clothes during the rainy season, but there is no obstacle to taking clothes during the winter and summer seasons if necessary. The division of clothing is also considered in this regard. It is not permissible for nirgranthas and nirgranthis to take pratihārik items and travel elsewhere without giving them to their owner. If someone steals an item, it should be investigated and returned to the owner if found. If necessary, it can be used with the owner's permission. In the fourth uddeśaka, the rules for atonement are laid out for offenses related to abrahmasevan, night-time meals, etc. A pandaka, napuṣaka, and vātika are ineligible for pravrajyā. Even having sexual intercourse with them, eating together, etc. is forbidden. It is inappropriate to teach scriptures to an avinīta, rasalolopi, or krodhi. The three types of people who are ineligible for pravrajyā and teaching are duṣṭa, mūḍha, and duvidagdha. If a nirgranthi is ill or for any other reason needs the support of their father, brother, son, etc. to get up or sit down, and desires the support of a sādhaka, they receive a cāturmāsika prāyaścitta. Similarly, if a nirgranthi mother, wife, etc. needs support and desires the support of a sādhvi, they also receive a cāturmāsika prāyaścitta. This is because there is a possibility of violating the fourth vrata, so atonement is prescribed. It is not permissible for nirgranthas and nirgranthis to accept kalātikrānta, kṣetrātikrānta, praśnādi, etc. It is not permissible to keep food brought by the first pauruṣī until the fourth pauruṣī. If it is forgotten, it should be given away. There is a rule for atonement if it is used. If, by mistake, an aneṣaṇīya, snigdha praśnādi, etc. has come in the alms, it should be given to a śramaṇa who has not established the mahāvrata. If there is no such śramaṇa, it should be given away in a blameless place. Food, etc. prepared for śramaṇas who are in the state of āchelakya, etc. is permissible for śramaṇas who are not in that state. Food, etc. prepared for śramaṇas who are not in that state is not permissible for śramaṇas who are in that state. Here, "kalpasthita" means "pancayāmadharmapratipanna" and "akalpasthita" means "cāturyāmadharmapratipanna". 1. "auṇik" means "ūranikānāmūrṇābhinivṛttam", "prauṣṭrik" means "uṣṭromabhinivṛttam", "sānak" means "sanavṛkṣavalkād jātam", "vācak" means "tṛṇaviśeṣastasy", "cipphak" means "kuṭṭitaḥ tvagūpaḥ tena niṣpanna vaccakcipphakam", "mujaḥ" means "śarastambastasy", "cipphakād jātam mūjccipphak" is the fifth. - U. 2, Sū. 25 [52]

---------------------------
If a Nigrantha wishes to be ordained in another gana due to knowledge or other reasons, the permission of the Acharya is required. Similarly, if a Pracharaya, Upadhyaya, Ganavachchedak, etc., wishes to be ordained in another gana, they should join the other gana only after making suitable arrangements in their own community. If a Shraman or Shramani attains Kaladharma during the evening or night, other Shraman-Shramanis should keep the dead body carefully throughout the night. In the morning, they should bring bamboo, etc., from a householder's house, tie the deceased with it, and place it on a harmless land in the forest. They should then return the bamboo, etc., to the householder. If a Shraman has quarreled with a householder, he should not engage in begging until the householder is pacified. To explain the method of accepting Pariharavishuddhacharitra, on the day of Parana, the Acharya and Upadhyaya themselves go to the Shraman, provide him with food, and after returning to their own place, explain the method of observing Pariharavishuddhacharitra. Shraman-Shramanis should not cross more than one of the five great rivers, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarayu, Koshika, and Mahi, in a month. Shallow rivers like Airavati, etc., can be crossed two or three times a month. Shraman-Shramanis should stay in harmless huts made of grass, where they cannot stand properly, during the Hemant and Grishma seasons. If the hut is made of harmless grass, etc., and is less than two hands high, they cannot stay there during the rainy season. If it is more than two hands high, they can stay there during the rainy season. The Pancham Uddeshak states that if a deva takes the form of a woman and holds the hand of a Sadhu, and the Sadhu considers her soft touch pleasurable, he incurs the sin of Mithuna Pratisevan and has to perform Chaturmasik Guru-Prayaschitta. Similarly, if a Sadhvi experiences the touch of a man and considers it pleasurable, she also incurs Chaturmasik Guru-Prayaschitta. If a Shraman joins another gana without resolving a conflict and the Acharya of that gana learns that he has come there after quarreling, he should be given a five-night punishment and then pacified and sent back to his own gana. If a strong or weak Shraman takes food, etc., thinking that the sun has risen or has not yet set, and then learns that the sun has not yet risen or has already set, he should immediately abandon the food, etc. He does not incur the sin of night food. One who takes food, etc., with doubt about sunrise and sunset incurs the sin of night food. Shraman-Shramanis should spit out any food, etc., that comes into their mouth through belching, etc., at night. If a Dwindriya, etc., creature falls into food, etc., it should be carefully removed and the food, etc., should be consumed. If it cannot be removed, it should be placed in a secluded, harmless place. If drops of water fall into food, etc., while eating, and the food is hot, there is no fault in eating it. [53] 

Page #55:

Because the drops that fall in it become unmindful / If the food is cold, one should neither eat it oneself nor feed it to others, but should place it in a secluded place. For a Nirgranthi, to live alone, to remain naked, to be without possessions, to take sunbath outside the village, to sit in Utkatukasana, Virasana, Dandasana, Lagudshayi and other asanas and perform Kayotsarga is the way. - It is inconceivable for Nirgranthis to take the Mok (urine or saliva) of each other, but it can be taken due to reasons like illness / If a Bhikshu in the form of a Parihar has to go elsewhere on the orders of a Sthavir, etc., he should go quickly and return after completing the work. If there is any kind of fault in the character, then one should purify oneself by performing atonement. In the sixth Uddeshak, it is stated that Nirgranthis should not speak six types of words: Alik (false) words, Heelitavachan, Khisitavachan, Parushavachan, Garhasthikavachan, Vyavashmitodiranavachan (words that stir up a settled dispute). One who accuses someone of Pranatipat, Mrishvad, Adattadan, Avirati-Abrahma, Napusak, Das, etc., receives atonement. If a thorn pricks the foot of a Nirgranthi and he is unable to remove it, then a Nirgranthi can remove it as an exception. Similarly, if there is a situation of drowning, falling, slipping, etc. in a river, etc., then a Sadhu or Sadhvi can save him by holding his hand / Similarly, a Nirgranthi with a disturbed mind can be taken to his place by holding his hand, in the same way, a Sadhvi can also take him by holding his hand. It should be remembered that these are exceptional sutras. There is no feeling of depravity in this, but a feeling of protecting each other's restraint. The name of the Sadhu's code of conduct is Kalpasthiti / It is of six types - Samayik-Sanyatakalpasthiti, Chhedopasthapaniya Sanyatakalpasthiti, Nirvishamanakalpasthiti, Nivishtakayikakalpasthiti, Jinkalpasthiti and Sthavirakalpasthiti. _In this way, Brihatkalpa sheds light on many important facts related to the life and conduct of Shraman-Shramani. This is the special feature of this scripture. Vyavaharsutra Brihatkalpa and Vyavahar are both complementary to each other / Vyavahar is also a Chhedasutra which is Charananuyogamaya. It has ten Uddeshak / 373 Anushtup shlokas are the available original text / 267 are the number of sutras. In the first Uddeshak, a Shraman who consumes a fault worthy of monthly atonement and criticizes that fault to the Acharya, etc. without deceit, receives a monthly atonement, while if he does it with deceit, he becomes a participant in a bi-monthly atonement. A Sadhak who criticizes a fault worthy of bi-monthly atonement without deceit receives a bi-monthly atonement, and if he does it with deceit, he receives a three-month atonement / In this way, three, four, five and six months [ 54 ]

---------------------------
There is a provision for atonement. The provision for atonement is for a maximum of six months. One who has committed many offenses should be criticized in order and then atonement should be taken for all together. Even while doing atonement, if the offense is committed again, then atonement should be done again. The Shraman who is taking atonement should get up and sit with other Sadhus only after taking permission from the Sthavir etc. If he sits with someone in violation of the permission, then his Dikshaparaya for that many days is reduced, which is called a hole in the Agamic language. He can go to another place for the service of Sthavir etc. by abandoning the Pariharakalp / A Shraman wanders alone by abandoning the Gan, and if he feels unable to follow the pure conduct, then he should be criticized and a hole or new Diksha should be taken / The same rule applies to the single-dwelling Ganavchhedak, Acharya and Shithilachari Shraman as is generally for the single-dwelling Shraman. Criticism should be done in front of the Pracharya, Upadhyay and atonement should be taken to become pure. If they are absent, then criticism should be done in front of their Sambhogi, Sarmic, Bahushrut etc. If they are not nearby, then criticism should be done by going to the Sambhogi, Bahushrut etc. Shraman of another community wherever they are and atonement should be taken. If they are also not there, then atonement should be taken by going to the Sarupik (Sadoshi) but Bahushrut Sadhu. If he is also not there, then atonement should be taken by going to the Bahushrut Shramanopasak, and if he is also absent, then atonement should be taken by going to the Samyagdristi Gahesth / In the absence of all these, stand facing the east or north direction outside the village or city, fold both hands and criticize your offense / It is said in the second Uddeshak that if two Sarmic are together with the same Samachari and one of them has committed an offense, then atonement should be taken in front of the other. The burden of service etc. of the one doing atonement remains on the other Shraman. If both have committed the offense, then they should criticize each other, take atonement and serve. If one Shraman has committed an offense out of many Shramans, then atonement should be given to only one / If all have committed an offense, then all except one should take atonement and purify themselves, and after their atonement is complete, he should also be given atonement and purified. It is not considered appropriate to remove the Pariharakalp-situated Shraman from the Gachch if he becomes ill / It is the duty of the Ganavchhedak to make him recite the Bayavritti until he becomes healthy, and after becoming healthy, he should take atonement because he served in the Sadoshavस्था. Similarly, the one who is doing Anvasthapy and Paranchik atonement should not be removed from the Gachch in the state of illness. The Viksiptchitt should also not be removed from the Gachch, and until his mind becomes stable, he should be served completely, and after becoming healthy, he should be given nominal atonement. Similarly, the Deeptchitt (whose mind has become inflamed with pride), Unmadprapt, Upsargprapt, Sadhikarana, Saprayaschitt etc. should not be removed from the Gachch. The ninth Anvasthapy atonement-taking Sadhu should be reinstated in Sanjam without making him wear Mrihsthalang [ 55 ] 

Page #57:
---------------------------
It should not be done, because its offense is so great that without doing so, its full atonement cannot be done, and nor is fear generated in the minds of other Shramans towards that type of offense. Similarly, after dressing the Shraman with the tenth Paranchik atonement in the garb of a householder, he should be re-established in restraint / This right is in the hands of the atonement giver that he can also dress him in another type of garb without dressing him in the garb of a householder. It is not appropriate for Pariharic and Apariharic Shramans to eat together / Apariharic Shramans should not eat with Pariharic Shramans without completing their tapas, because those who are ascetics, after completing their tapas, cannot eat with them before one month of tapas has passed for five days and six months of tapas for one month, because during those days they need a special type of food which is not necessary for others / The third Uddeshak states that if a Shraman has a desire in his mind to wander independently, but he is not knowledgeable about Acharang etc., then even if he has disciples etc. with his family, it is not appropriate to be independent by forming a separate gana. If he is knowledgeable about Acharang etc., then he should wander after taking permission from the sthavir, the one who wanders without the permission of the sthavir has to be a part of the chhed or Pariharic atonement for as many days as he has wandered in this way. Only one who has been initiated for at least three years, is proficient in the practice of Nirgranth, is proficient in restraint, is proficient in Acharang Pradi Pravachanshastras, is fully capable of giving atonement, is skilled in deciding the field etc. for the Sangha, is virtuous, is learned etc. can become an Upadhyay / One who is skilled in the practice of Shraman, is eloquent in preaching, is knowledgeable about Dashashrutaskandha-Kalpa-Brihatkalpavyavahar and has been initiated for at least five years can become an Acharya / Acharya, Upadhyay, Pravartini, Sthavir, Gani, Ganavchhedak can be given to one who is skilled in the practice of Shraman, is proficient in preaching, is unattached in mind and is knowledgeable about Stananga-Samavayanga. In an exception, a sadhu who has been initiated for one day can also be established in the position of Acharya, Upadhyay. Such a sadhu must be a believer, patient, trustworthy, impartial, joyful, permitted, majority and of high birth and endowed with qualities. One should follow restraint only with the permission of the Acharya or Upadhyay / One who consumes non-Brahma is ineligible for the position of Acharya etc. / If he has done such a deed after abandoning the Gachchha, then after taking re-initiation and three years have passed, if his mind is stable, his vices are calm, there is no lack of kashaya etc., then he can be established in the position of Acharya. The fourth Uddeshak states that there should be at least one other sadhu with the Acharya or Upadhyay in the Hemant and Grishma seasons and two with the Ganavchhedak / In the rainy season, it is necessary to have two sadhus with the Acharya and Upadhyay and three with the Ganavchhedak. [ 56 ]

---------------------------
This text sheds light on the importance of the Acharya and explains how to conduct oneself in their absence. If the Acharya or Upadhyaya are severely ill and their life expectancy is low, all other Shramans should be called together and the Acharya should declare that upon his passing, a particular Sadhu should be bestowed with a particular position. If, after the Acharya's death, that Sadhu does not appear to be suitable, another can be appointed. If the Sadhu is deemed worthy, he should be appointed. If another worthy Shraman is not yet proficient in the Acharanga and other texts, then with the consent of the Acharya and others, the Sadhu can be temporarily appointed to any position. Upon finding a suitable candidate, the previous individual should relinquish their position. Failure to do so will result in a penance. If two Shramans are traveling together, they should conduct themselves as senior and junior according to their merit and respect each other. The same applies to the Acharya and Upadhyaya. In the fifth Uddeshak, it is stated that the Pravartini should travel from village to village during the cold and hot seasons with at least two other Sadhvis, and the Ganavachhedaka should be accompanied by three other Sadhvis. During the rainy season, the Pravartini should be accompanied by three and the Ganavachhedaka by four Sadhvis. The same rules regarding the death of the Pravartini and the appointment of a successor that apply to Shramans should also be understood for Shramanis. The general rule for Vaiavrittya is that a Shraman should not perform Vaiavrittya for a Shramani, and vice versa. However, they can serve each other as an exception. In exceptional circumstances, such as a snakebite, service can be obtained from a householder. This rule applies to Sthavirakalpis. There is no provision for service for Jinakalpis. If they seek service, they must perform a Pariharic penance. The sixth Uddeshak states that one should not visit their relatives without the permission of the Sthaviras. Shramans and Shramanis who are of limited knowledge and experience should not visit their relatives alone. If they must visit, they should do so with a Shraman or Shramani who is well-versed in knowledge and experience. Any food that is prepared before the arrival of a Shraman is acceptable, but anything that is not prepared is not acceptable. When the Acharya or Upadhyaya arrive at the Upashraya from outside, their feet should be wiped clean. Their belongings, such as their small bag, should be carefully placed on the ground. They should be served with Vaiavrittya as much as possible. They should be accompanied within the Upashraya. When they leave the Upashraya, they should be accompanied. The Ganavachhedaka should be accompanied within the Upashraya and when leaving. Shramans and Shramanis are expected to live with Shramans and Shramanis who are knowledgeable in the Acharanga and other Agamas. Living with those who are not knowledgeable will result in penance. If Shramans and Shramanis from other Gachchas come for a specific reason, and they are innocent, virtuous, free from major faults, untouched by anger and other vices, and self-critical, then they should be treated with equality. Otherwise, they should not be. [ 57 ]

---------------------------
The seventh Uddeshak states that a Sadhu should not initiate a woman and a Sadhvi should not initiate a man. If a woman in a place where there is no Sadhvi nearby feels a desire for renunciation, then she can be initiated on the condition that she will be entrusted to a Sadhvi as soon as possible. Similarly, a Sadhvi can also initiate a man. It is not considered appropriate for Shramanis to wander in places where thieves, rogues, or wicked people are prevalent, as there is a fear of theft of clothes and other belongings, and violation of vows. There is no such restriction for Shramans. If a Shraman has a feud with another Shraman who resides in a dangerous place (a place inhabited by thieves, etc.), then he should go there and apologize to him, but not while staying in his own place. However, a Shramani can apologize from her own place. It is not considered appropriate for Sadhus and Sadhvis to wander freely without the control of the Acharya and Upadhyaya. The eighth Uddeshak highlights that a Sadhu should bring bedding and other necessities that can be carried in one hand, and should be brought from a distance that can be covered in three days. For a bound Nirgranth, it is considered appropriate to bring necessities from a distance that can be covered in five days, if needed. The following equipment is considered appropriate for a Sthavir: Danda, Bhand, Chatra, Matrika, Lasthik (pillow or cushion to be kept behind the back), a cushion for meditation, Chel (cloth), Chel-Chilimilika (cloth curtain), Charm, Charmkosh (leather bag), Charm-Palich (piece of leather for wrapping). Those items that cannot be carried along can be kept at the home of a householder near the Upashraya and used from time to time. If there are many Shramans in a place, and one of them forgets an item at a householder's place, and another Shraman goes there, then the householder should tell the Shraman that this item belongs to a saint of your community. The saint should then take the item and return to his own place and give it to the one who owns it. If the item does not belong to any saint, then he should neither use it himself nor give it to others to use, but should abandon it in a harmless place. If the Shraman has already left from there, then he should search for him and deliver it to him personally. If his exact whereabouts are not known, then he should leave it in a secluded place. While discussing Pahar, it is mentioned that one who eats eight morsels is called Alp-Yahari, one who eats twelve morsels is called Aparthavmaudrik, one who eats sixteen morsels is called Dvibhagaprapt, one who eats twenty-four morsels is called Praptavamoudrik, one who eats thirty-two morsels is called Pramanopetatari, and one who eats one morsel less than thirty-two is called Avamoudrik. The ninth Uddeshak states that if a Shramatar has ownership or some right over food, then that food is not acceptable for Shramans and Shramanis. It also mentions the Bhikshu-Pratimans, which we have already discussed in the description of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha. The tenth Uddeshak describes the form of Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima or Vanamdhyachandra-Pratima, stating that one which is thick in the middle like a barley grain and thin on both sides is called Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima. One which is thin in the middle like a forest and thick on both sides is called Vajramdhyachandra-Pratima. The holder of Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima is called Vamdhyachandra-Pratima. One who is like a forest [ 58 ]

---------------------------
A Shraman, for a period of one month, renounces attachment to his body and bears all favorable and unfavorable circumstances related to Devas, humans, and animals with equanimity. On the first day of the bright fortnight, he takes one datti of food and one datti of water. On the second day, he takes two datti of food and two datti of water. In this way, he increases by one datti each day, taking 15 datti of food and 15 datti of water on the full moon day. In the dark fortnight, he decreases by one datti each day and observes a fast on the new moon day. This is called Yavamध्यचन्द्रप्रतिमा. In Vajramध्यचन्द्रप्रतिमा, 15 datti of food and 15 datti of water are taken on the first day of the dark fortnight. This is decreased daily until one datti of food and one datti of water are taken on the new moon day. In the bright fortnight, one datti is increased each day until a fast is observed on the full moon day. Thus, in each 30-day pratima, food is taken according to datti for 29 days and a fast is observed on the last day. There are five types of व्यवहार: आगम, श्रुत, आज्ञा, धारणा, and जीतव्यवहार. आगम is the first and the others are discussed in detail in the commentary. There are three types of स्थविर: जातिस्थविर, सूत्रस्थविर, and प्रव्रज्यास्थविर. A Shraman who is 60 years old is called जातिस्थविर or वयःस्थविर. One who knows ठाणांग and समवायांग is called सूत्रस्थविर, and one who has been initiated for 20 years and is निर्ग्रन्थ is called प्रव्रज्यास्थविर. There are three types of शैक्ष भूमियां: सप्त-रात्रिदिनी, चातुर्मासिकी, and षण्मासिकी. It is not permissible to initiate children below the age of eight years. Those who are young are not eligible to study प्राचारांगसूत्र. It is permissible to teach आचारांग to a sadhu who has been initiated for at least three years. It is permissible to teach सूत्रकृतांग to one who has been initiated for four years, दशाश्रुतस्कन्ध, कल्प (बृहत्कल्प), and व्यवहार to one who has been initiated for five years, स्थानांग and समवायांग to one who has been initiated for eight years, व्याख्याप्रज्ञप्ति (भगवती) to one who has been initiated for ten years, लघुविमान-प्रविभक्ति, महाविमानप्रविभक्ति, अंगचूलिका, बंगलिका, and विवाह-चूलिका to one who has been initiated for eleven years, अणोरुपपातिक, गरुलोपपातिक, धरणोपपातिक, वैश्रमणोपपातिक, and वैलंधरोपपातिक to one who has been initiated for twelve years, उपस्थानश्रुत, देवेन्द्रोपपात, and नागपरियापनिका (नागपरियावणिग्रा) to one who has been initiated for thirteen years, स्वप्नभावना to one who has been initiated for fourteen years, चारणभावना to one who has been initiated for fifteen years, वेदनीशतक to one who has been initiated for sixteen years, पाशीविषभावना to one who has been initiated for seventeen years, दृष्टिविधभावना to one who has been initiated for eighteen years, दृष्टिवाद to one who has been initiated for nineteen years, and all types of scriptures to one who has been initiated for twenty years. वैयावृत्य (service) is said to be of ten types: 1. आचार्य की वैयावृत्य, 2. उपाध्याय की वैयावृत्य, 3. स्थविर की, 4. तपस्वी की, 5. शैक्ष-छात्र की, 6. ग्लान-रुग्ण की, 7. सामिक की, 8. कल की, 9. गण की, and 10. संघ की वैयावृत्य. The above ten types of वैयावृत्य lead to महानिर्जरा. In conclusion, this sutra has many special features. It emphasizes स्वाध्याय. [59] 

Page #61:
---------------------------
Furthermore, studying during an inappropriate time is prohibited. The concept of an inappropriate time for study has been discussed. The limits of study among monks and nuns have been defined. There is a description of the types of food intake: Kavalahari, Alpahari, and Unodari. Rules for the conduct of the Acharya and Upadhyaya in the Bihar have been laid down. There is a detailed discussion of the methods of criticism and atonement. The rules and regulations regarding the residence, study, conduct, and organization of the nuns have been discussed. The author of this work is believed to be Shrutakevali Bhadrabahu. 

To understand the profound secrets of the Agam literature, various commentaries have been created. This vast body of Agam commentary can be divided into five parts: (1) Niyuktis (Nijjutti), (2) Bhashyas (Bhas), (3) Chuniyas (Chunni), (4) Sanskrit commentaries, and (5) Commentaries written in vernacular languages. 

The first commentaries written in Prakrit language, known as Niyuktis, are famous. In Niyuktis, instead of commenting on every verse of the original text, the focus is primarily on explaining technical terms. Its style is that of the Niksepa method, which has been highly favored in jurisprudence. In the Niksepa method, after presenting multiple possible meanings of a single verse, the inappropriate meanings are rejected, and the appropriate meaning is accepted. The renowned German scholar, Sharpeentier, defined Niyukti as follows: "Niyuktis serve only as an index to their main part. They briefly mention all the detailed events." Bhadrabahu is considered the author of Niyuktis. We have written extensively about who he was in other introductions. Ten Niyuktis of Bhadrabahu are available. Among them is the Dasashrutaskandhaniyukti. 

The Dasashrutaskandhaniyukti begins with salutations to the first Shrutakevali Bhadrabahu, followed by a description of the rights of the ten studies. The first study, Asamadhisthan, discusses the relationship between dravya and bhava samadhi, and describes fifteen Niksepas: the name of the place, establishment, dravya, area, faith, upward, conduct, residence, restraint, acceptance, warrior, immovable, counting, institution (sanghan), and bhava. The second study considers four Niksepas, starting with the name Shabala. The third study analyzes Ashatana. The fourth study, while considering the Niksepa perspective on "Gani" and "Sampada," states that Gani and Guni are synonymous. Prachar is the first Ganisthan. Sampada has two divisions: dravya and bhava. The body is dravya sampada, and conduct is bhava sampada. The fifth study considers the Niksepa perspective on chitta samadhi. There are four types of samadhi. When the mind is free from attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in focused attention, then it is bhava samadhi. The sixth study considers the Niksepa perspective on the Upasaka and the image. There are four types of Upasaka: dravyopasaka, tadarthopaasaka, mohopaasaka, and bhavopaasaka. Only one whose life is illuminated by the light of Samyagdarshan can be a Bhavopaasaka. Here, the eleventh [60] ...

---------------------------
This is a representation of the paradigms. In the seventh study, while contemplating the Shraman pratima, five types have been mentioned: Samadhi pratima, Bhava-bhraman pratima, Upadhan pratima, Viveka pratima, and Prati-sanlin pratima. In the eighth study, while contemplating the Paryushana kalpa, Paryavasana, Paryushana, Payu-pashmana, Varshavas, Pratham-samavasaran, Sthapana, and Jyestha graha have been described as synonyms. The Shraman resides in one place during Varshavas and wanders for the remaining months. In the ninth study, while considering the Mohaniya-sthana, its synonyms for Moha have been mentioned: Pap, Bary, Vaer, Pank, Panak, Kshobh, Asat, Sang, Shalya, Atr, Nirati, and Dharty. In the tenth study, while contemplating the root causes of birth and death, the means to be liberated from them have been explained. After the Niyukti literature, the Bhashya literature was created, but no Bhashya was written on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. After the Bhashya literature, the Churni literature was created. This is a prose-based explanatory literature. It contains explanations written in pure Prakrit and a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit. The name of Churnikar Jinadasagani Mahttar is particularly noteworthy in the Churni literature. The Dasha-shruta-skandha-churni is based on the Dasha-shruta-skandha Niyukti. This Churni begins with a Mangalacharan. After that, the chapters of the ten studies have been discussed. It is simple and easy to understand. There are some differences between the original text and the Churni-approved text. This Churni is primarily in the Prakrit language. Sanskrit words and sentences are also used here and there. After the Churni, the era of Sanskrit commentaries came. In that era, commentaries were written in Sanskrit on many Agamas. Brahmamuni (Brahmarshi) wrote a commentary on the Dasha-shruta-skandha, and Acharya Ghasilalji M. wrote an explanation in Sanskrit on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. Acharya Samrat Atmaramji M. wrote a commentary in Hindi on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. And Acharya Amolkarishiji M. wrote the first Hindi translation. The Dasha-shruta-skandha, including the original Niyukti and Churni, was published in Vikrama Samvat 2011 by Mani-vijayji Gani Granthamala, Bhavnagar. The Hindi translation of the Dasha-shruta-skandha by Amolkarishiji was published in Vira Samvat 2445 by Sukhdevsahay Jwalaprasad, Hyderabad. The Hindi commentary by Acharya Atmaramji M. was published in 1936 by the Jain Shastramala office, Saidmittha Bazaar, Lahore. The Dasha-shruta-skandha by Ghasilalji M. was published in 1960 by the Jain Shastroddhar Samiti, Rajkot, along with the Sanskrit explanation and Hindi translation. The original-based translation, under the name "Prayar-Dasha," was published in 1981 by Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao. Special meanings have also been given in it here and there. This edition has been done by the knowledgeable Mahamanishi Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal," an expert in the literature of the Pragama. This edition is not only beautiful but also extremely beautiful. He has presented a neutral, thought-provoking solution to the mysteries of the Agam and the various entangled questions of Shramanachar, based on ancient explanatory literature. In a few words [ 61 ]

Clarifying the subject is a characteristic of the editor Muni. His profound scholarship is evident throughout this edition. The commentary on the Brihatkalpa is written in the style of the Brihatkalpaniyukti-Dasashrutaskandha, similar to the Brihatkalpaniyukti. It begins by paying homage to the Tirthankaras, then contemplates the various types of knowledge, highlighting the inherent unity of knowledge and auspiciousness. It examines the Anuyoga through the seven deposits of name, establishment, substance, field, time, speech, and emotion. The Anuyoga is the post-existent yoga, or the subtle form of yoga. The four gateways to Anuyoga are the beginning, deposit, following, and perspective of the Kalpa. The wise, learned, long-ordained, contemplative, unwavering, established, non-procrastinating, knowledgeable, authorized, and emotionally-transformative saint contemplates the study of Kalpa and practice. It elaborates on the Tal-Pralamb, and prescribes atonement for its acceptance. It also contemplates the deposits of terms like village, city, Kheda, Karbatak, Madamb, port, Akar, Dronamukha, Nigama, capital, Pashram, Nivesh, Sambadh, Ghosh, Anshika, etc. It sheds light on the Jainic and the non-Jainic perspectives. While considering the term "Aarya," it contemplates the twelve deposits of name, establishment, substance, field, caste, lineage, karma, language, craft, knowledge, vision, and character. Wandering in the Aarya field leads to the growth of knowledge, vision, and character. Wandering in non-Aarya fields increases the possibility of acquiring various faults. This fact is clarified by citing the example of Skandacharya. It also instructs on wandering in non-Aarya fields for the growth of knowledge, vision, and character, and provides the example of King Samprati. The conduct, thoughts, food, and movement of Shramans and Shramanis are beautifully described in brief. The commentary is presented throughout using the deposit method. This Niyukti is not independent but is integrated into the Brihatkalpa Bhashya. The Brihatkalpa-Ladhubhashya-Brihatkalpa Ladhubhashya is a very important work of Sanghadasagani. It elaborates on the verses of the Brihatkalpasutra. Despite being a Ladhubhashya, it has 6490 verses. It is divided into six objectives. The Bhashya begins with a detailed preface, which has 805 verses. This Bhashya compiles and assesses important cultural material from India. Dr. Motichand, in his book "Sarthavah," has beautifully assessed "Travelers and Sarthavahs" based on some aspects of this cultural material. Its content is particularly useful for studying ancient Indian culture and civilization. The heart-touching, subtle, and logical analysis of the conduct of Jain Shramans is a significant feature of this Bhashya. The preface discusses the auspiciousness, the context of Shrutagyan in the Panchakgyan, the sequence of attaining Samyaktva, and the nature of Praupashmik, Sasvadan, Kshayopashmik, Vedak, and Kshayik Samyaktva. It explains the nature of Anuyoga and contemplates it through twelve types of gateways, including deposits. It contemplates Kalpavyavahar from various perspectives, using examples to clarify the subject. The commentary on the first objective explains various types of faults and atonement related to the Tal-tree, exceptions related to the acceptance of Tal-Pralamb, the reasons and methods for Shramans and Shramanis to travel to other countries, the rules and regulations for the illness of Shramans, and the types of texts of Vaishyas. It explains the conduct of Shramans and Shramanis in special circumstances like famine, etc.

This text describes the method of living in the field of non-attachment, its 144 transgressions and related atonement, etc. It discusses terms like village, city, hamlet, Karbatak, Madamb, port, rampart, Dronamukha, Nigama, capital, ashram, investment, Sambadha, Anshika, Putbhedan, Shankar, etc. It describes the Nakshatra month, Chandra month, Ritu month, Aditya month and Abhidhit month. It discusses the actions of Jinakalpika and Sthavirakalpika, Samvasarana, Tirthankara, Ganadhara, Aharakshariri, Anuttardeva, Chakravarti, Baldeva, Vasudeva, etc., their auspicious and inauspicious karma natures, the transformation of the Tirthankara's language into different languages, Afnagrigha, Rathiyamukha, Shringatak, Chatushk, Chatvar, Antaraphna, etc. It sheds light on the potential faults that may befall the Shramanis residing in the Upashrayas built in those places. The commentator has described twelve types of Dravya Gram (1) Uttanakamallaka, (2) Avaang Mukhamallaka, (3) Samputamallaka, (4) Uttanakhandamallaka, (5) Avaang Mukhkhandamallaka, (6) Samputakhandamallaka, (7) Bhiti, (8) Padali, (9) Valabhi, (10) Akshatak, (11) Ruchka, (12) Kashyapak. Jinakalpika Munis exist only during the time of Tirthankara, Ganadhara and Kevali. The Samachari of Jinakalpika Muni is described through twenty-seven doors: (1) Shruta, (2) Sanhanan, (3) Upsarga, (4) Atanka, (5) Vedana, (6) Katijan, (7) Sthandila, (8) Vasati, (9) Kiyaachir, (10) Ucchaar, (11) Prasravan, (12) Avakash, (13) Trunphalaka, (14) Sanrakshanata, (15) Sansthapanata, (16) Prabhriti, (17) Praagni, (18) Deep, (19) Avadhan, (20) Vatsyaksha, (21) Bhikshacharya, (22) Panak, (23) Lepalepa, (24) Lepa, (25) Prachaaml (26) Pratima, (27) Masakalp / While contemplating the state of Jinakalpika, light has been shed through these doors: field, time, character, pilgrimage, cycle, scripture, Veda, Kalpa, Linga, Leshya, meditation, calculation, acceptance, renunciation, shaving, atonement, cause, Nishpratikarma and devotion. After this, the nature of Pariharavishuddhik and Yathalndik Kalpa is explained. The pravrajya, education, earning, irregular residence and outcome of Sthavirakalpika are all the same as Jinakalpika. While shedding light on the conduct of Shramanas, it describes the time of conduct, the area suitable or unsuitable for residence and sustenance of the Gachchha before conducting, the selection of supervisors, how to travel for the transcription of the area, the conduct route and Sthandila land, water, resting place, alms, residence, disturbance, etc., the method of entering the transcribable area, examining the inner mind of the humans there through alms, the knowledge of ease and difficulty in obtaining alms, medicine, etc., the permission of the head of the residence before conducting, seeing auspicious omens before conducting, etc. The Samachari of Sthavirakalpika sheds light on these points: 1. Transcription - the time of transcription of clothes, etc., the faults of transcription and their atonement / 2. Exit - the time of exiting the Upashraya / 3. Prabhriti - whether or not to stay in the house prepared for the householder. The related method and atonement / [63]

The Four Nature Sutras state that monks and nuns should not travel from one village to another during the rainy season. If they do, they incur a penance. If there is an exceptional reason to travel, they should do so with great care. The Avagraha Sutra states that when a monk is going for alms or to the ground for sanitation, etc., and a householder requests him to take clothes, bowls, blankets, etc., he should take them and give them to the preceptor, etc., and use them only after obtaining their permission. The Ratribhakt Prakrut Sutra states that one should not consume food or drink at night or during the twilight hours, nor should one accept clothes, etc. Traveling at night and during the twilight hours is also prohibited. There are two types of paths: panth and marg. Panth is a path where there is nothing between, such as a village, town, etc., and marg is a path where there are villages and towns in between. There are five types of merchants: bhandi, bahilka, bharavah, praudarik, and karpatik. There are eight types of merchants and eight types of merchant managers. For travel, the Aryan region is particularly suitable. The term "Aryan" has been considered in terms of twelve deposits, including name, etc. There are six Aryan races: Ambastha, Kalinda, Vaideha, Vidak, Harit, and Tantun. There are also six types of Aryan families: Ugra, Bhog, Rajanya, Kshatriya, Jnat-Kaurava, and Ikshvaku. Further, in the discussion related to the upashraya, the obstacles to the upashraya have been elaborated upon. A monk should not stay in a place where grains like rice and barley, etc., are scattered, nor should he stay in a place where there are jars of liquor, jars of cold water, light, lamps, food, milk, yogurt, butter, etc. The method of abandoning the food offered by the Sagarik, the method of donating food brought from another place, the method of accepting food from the Samarik, the method of accepting food, utensils, etc., made for specific individuals, and the method of accepting menstruation offerings have been explained. There are five types of clothes: (1) jangik, (2) bhangik, (3) sanak, (4) potak, (5) tiriṭpatṭak, and five types of menstruation offerings: (1) auṇik, (2) prauṣṭrik, (3) sanak, (4) vakcakcippik, (5) mujcippik. Their nature and method of acceptance have been explained. The third Uddeshak explains the method of entering the upashraya of the nirgranth and the nirgranthis. The acceptance of clothes, etc., which are whole and not whole, different and not different, and the contemplation on the title of newly initiated monks and nuns have been discussed. The method of accepting the title, the method of bowing, etc., have been established. While contemplating on the violence and non-violence involved in tearing clothes, the violence of substance and the violence of feeling have been considered. The more intense the passion, etc., in violence, the more intense the karmic bondage. The karmic bondage due to knowledge and ignorance in the violent, the diversity of karmic bondage due to the diversity of the locus, etc., have been contemplated. The fourth Uddeshak establishes the penance for manual labor, etc. The feeling of sexual desire can never be free from passion, etc. Therefore, it is not an exception. The initiation of the Pandak, etc., into the order is prohibited. The fifth Uddeshak sheds light on the matters related to the gachchha, the remembrance of the scriptures, and the obstacles related to the subject, the faults incurred by staying in the gachchha with a troubled mind or by abandoning one's own gachchha and going to another gachchha, and their penance, the unhesitant and hesitant night meals, the faults related to belching, vomiting, etc., and their penance, the effort for food, etc. Special rules and regulations have been laid down for nuns. The sixth Uddeshak describes the use of harmless words and the non-use of false words, the penance for taking life, etc., the removal of thorns, the faults arising from misinterpretation, the exception to penance. Monks and nuns should use [65]

One should not deviate from the path. Understanding the reasons behind the deranged state of a nirgranthi, the text discusses the arrangements for their care and the rules and prohibitions regarding their treatment, etc. / For Shramanas, six types of Parimanu Vyadhat are considered - (1) Kautkucit (2) Moukharik (3) Chakshulol (4) Titinik (5) Ichchalom (6) Bhijjanidanakaran - their nature, faults, exceptions, etc. are contemplated. _ In Kalpasthiti Prakrut, six types of Kalpasthitis are discussed - (1) Samayikkalpasthiti, (2) Chhedopasthanayakalpasthiti, (3) Nivishmanakalpasthiti, (4) Nivishtakayikakalpasthiti, (5) Jinkalpasthiti, (6) Stavirakalpasthiti. Chhedopasthanayakalpasthiti has ten Kalpas - Achelky, Prauddeshik, etc. Its possessors and non-possessors are also contemplated. In this commentary, there are scattered Subhashitas, such as "O humans! Be ever vigilant, the intellect of a vigilant human develops, he who is awake is always blessed." "Jagarah Nara Nicham, Jagaramanasas Badhate Buddhi / So Suvati // So Dhanam, Jo Jagati So Saya Dhanno //"  "Character and modesty are the ornaments of a woman. A woman's body cannot be adorned with ornaments like necklaces, etc. Her ornament is only character and modesty." "In a gathering, speech devoid of good conduct and improper is not considered praiseworthy." Thus, this commentary presents a very subtle analysis of the conduct and thoughts of Shramanas from a logical perspective. It also sheds considerable light on the social, cultural, religious, and political conditions of that era. There is beautiful analysis from a psychological perspective in many places. This 'Grantharatna' has an unparalleled and unique place not only in the history of Jain literature but also in Indian literature. Brihatkalpachurni is the primary source and Laghubhashya of this Churni. / The initial part of Dasashrutaskandhachurni and Brihatkalpachurni is almost similar. Linguists believe that Dasashrutaskandhani is older than Brihatkalpachurni. It is possible that both these Churnis belong to the same Acharya. This Churni has a preface and six Uddeshak. / In the beginning, the nature of knowledge is contemplated. / While stating that Abhidhan and Abhidhey are sometimes different and sometimes the same, six synonyms for the word 'Vriksh' are given in different languages. What is called 'Vriksh' in Sanskrit is called 'Rukkh' in Prakrit, 'Prodan' in Magadhi, 'Kar' in Lat, 'Chor' in Tamil, and 'Idaku' in Andhra. The Churni mentions texts like Tattvarthadhigama, Visheshavashyakabhashya, Karmaprakriti, Mahakala, Govindaniyanti, etc. The language is Sanskrit-mixed Prakrit. The name of the author is not mentioned in the Churni from beginning to end.

This commentary is on the *Brihatkalpa* and its *Niyukti* written by Bhadrabaahu Swami and the *Laghubhashya* written by Sanghdasagani. Acharya Malayagiri could only write his commentary up to verse 606 of the *Peethika*. He did not write any further commentary. The remaining commentary was completed by Acharya Kshemakirti, as acknowledged by Kshemakirti himself. At the beginning of the commentary, the commentator has paid homage to Jinesvara Deva and remembered his Sadgurudev, and expressed gratitude to the commentator and the *Churnikara*. The commentator has written about the creators of the *Brihatkalpa* and *Vyavahara Sutra* that the fourteen *Purvadhara* Bhadrabaahu Swami created the *Kalpa* and *Vyavahara* for the benefit of the *Shramanas* so that there would be no interruption in the *Prayaschitta*. He created the *Niyukti* to clarify the profound secrets of the *Sutra*. The commentator created the *Bhashya* for those of limited intellect who lack brilliance. The *Niyukti* and *Bhashya* both reveal the meaning of the *Sutra* and thus became one text. The commentary uses Prakrit verses as quotations and cites Prakrit stories to make the subject matter easier to understand. The present *Malayagiri Vritti* has 4600 verses. Thus, we see that Acharya Malayagiri was a profound scholar of the scriptures. The deep discussion and analysis of various philosophies found in his commentaries is not available anywhere else. He was a great philosopher, renowned commentator, and a great lecturer of his time. His ability to present the profound secrets of the *Agamas* in a logical style was amazing and unique. Saubhagyasagar wrote a commentary on the *Brihatkalpa* in Sanskrit. The *Brihatkalpa Niyukti*, *Laghubhashya*, and the commentaries of Malayagiri and Kshemakirti were published from 1933 to 1941 by the Jain Pratmananda Sabha, Bhavnagar, Saurashtra. The present text was edited by Chaturvijayji and Punyavijayji. This edition can be considered excellent from the perspective of editing skills. The *Brihatkalpa* was published with a commentary by an unknown commentator by the Samyakgyan Pracharak Mandal, Jodhpur. In 1923, it was published with German commentary, etc., by W. Schubring, Leipzig, 1905: original only in Nagari script - Pune, 1923. In 1915, Dr. Jivraj Ghelabhai Doshi published it with a Gujarati translation from Ahmedabad, and Acharya Amolakrishiji M. published it with a Hindi translation by Sukhdevsahay Jwalaprasad Jauhari, Hyderabad. In 1977, it was published by Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao, under the name "Kappsuttam" with a literal translation and special meaning. The present editor of this text is Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal', the founder of Agam Anuyog. His word-by-word translation and editing are captivating. Based on ancient commentary literature, the editor has attempted to clarify many hidden secrets. The commentary literature on the *Vyavahara Sutra* is a vibrant commentary on the practice of *Shraman* life. In the *Vyavahara Niyukti*, the *Utsarga* and *Apavada* are as follows: 1. Shri Malayagiri Prabhavo, Yam Kattu Mupakramant Matimantah / Sa Kalpashastra Teeka Maya Anusandhoyate Alpadhiyaa / - Brihatkalpa Peethikavritti, p. 177 [67]

This is a discussion. There is also a commentary on this appointment. Which is more detailed. The appointments of the Brihatkalpa and Vyavahar are very similar in terms of style, sentiment and language. The facts and principles of sadhana are almost the same in both. This appointment has been merged into the commentary. We have already mentioned in the past that the name of the author of the Vyavahar Bhashya has not yet been known. Like the Brihatkalpa Bhashya, this Bhashya also sheds light on the conduct and thoughts of the Nirgrantha and Nirgranthis. First of all, the nature of Vyavahar, Vyavhari and Vyavhartavya has been discussed in the preface. From the point of view of faults in conduct, the meaning, difference, cause, special study, Tadah Parshad etc. of atonement have been discussed and many examples have also been given to clarify the subject. After this, contemplation has been done from the point of view of deposit on the words like Bhikshu, Masparihar, Sthanapratisevana, Alochana etc. There is a separate provision of atonement for Atikram, Vyatikrama, Atichar, Anachar related to Adhakarma. The purity of both Mulaguna and Uttaraguna is done by atonement. For Atikram, there is a provision of Masaguru and Kalalghu atonement, for Atichar, Tapoguru and Kalaguru and for Anachar, Chaturguru atonement. Pindavishuddhi Samiti Bhavana Tap Pratima and Abhiggraha are all in Uttaraguna. They have forty-two, eighty, twenty-five, twelve, twelve and four differences respectively. There are two types of the man who does atonement: Nirgat and Vartaman. Those who have crossed the Atikrant by Tapohr atonement are Nirgat and those who are present are Vartaman. Their differences have also been made. There are four types of men who are eligible for atonement: 1. Ubhaytara who can serve others while practicing the sadhana of restraint and penance. 2. Atmatara - who can only do penance. 3. Paratara - who can only serve. 4. Anyatara - who can only practice one of penance and service at a time. Malochana Palochanaha and Alochak do not happen without. Alochanaha is itself Acharavan, Pradharavan, Vyavharavan, Apvridak, Prakurbhi, Niryapak, Apayadarshi and Aparishrabi, endowed with these qualities. The Alochak is also endowed with these ten qualities: Jatisampanna, Kulsampanna, Vinayasampanna, Gyanasampanna, Darshanasampanna, Charanasampanna, Kshata, Danta, Amayi and Apachchattpi. Along with this, the Bhashyakar has also contemplated on the faults of Alochana, the substance that is the subject of it, etc., the method of giving atonement, etc. In the description of Pariharatap, the analysis of service has been done and examples of Subhadra and Mugawati have also been given. The five types of Aroopana: Prasthapanika, Sthapita, Kritsna, Akritsna and Hadhada have been told and discussed in detail. There is a description of various types of atonements for leaving the Gachch due to laxity and rejoining the Gachch. The nature of Parsvastha, Yathachchanda, Kushil, Pravasanna and Sansakta has been highlighted. [68]

---------------------------
While discussing the conduct of Shramans, solitary conduct has been prohibited and the faults associated with it have been described.  The text lays down the rules for serving ascetics of various types and those afflicted with diseases, highlighting the psychological approach to serving those with agitated minds (Kshiptachitt) and those with excited minds (Deeptachitt). The three causes of an agitated mind are attachment, fear, and insult. The cause of an excited mind is honor. When honored, pride arises in such a person. Due to this pride, they become excited (Deeptachitt) after defeating their enemies. The main difference between an agitated mind and an excited mind is that an agitated mind usually remains silent, while an excited mind speaks even without purpose. The commentator has considered the qualifications of those who hold the positions of Ganavachchedak, Pracharaya, Upadhyaya, Pravartak, Sthavir, Pravatini, etc. Those who are knowledgeable in the eleven Angas, knowledgeable in the Navam Purva, are Kritayogi, Bahushruta, knowledgeable in many Agamas, experts in Sutra-artha, are patient, are Shruta-nigharsha, and are Mahajan, are the only ones who can hold the distinguished positions of Pracharaya, etc. While discussing the rules and regulations regarding the conduct of Shramans, it has been stated that how many saints should an Acharya, Upadhyaya, etc. stay with at least, etc. various rules and regulations have been described. An Acharya and Upadhyaya have five duties, which Shramans should pay special attention to: 1. Cleaning their feet when they go out. 2. Placing their utterance and excretion in a clean place. 3. Following their wishes. 4. Staying with them inside the shelter. 5. Going out with them. A Shraman can initiate a woman and after initiation, she should be handed over to a Sadhvi. A Sadhvi cannot initiate any man. She should be sent to a qualified Shraman for initiation. A Shramani who has been initiated in one group should not be initiated in another group. She should be initiated where she wants to stay, but there is no such rule for Shramans. An Upadhyaya with three years of initiation can become an Acharya with five years of initiation. The text describes a place suitable for Varshavas, where there is no excessive mud, no abundance of two-sense and other beings, the land is fertile, there are two or three habitable settlements, there is an abundance of juice, there are many physicians, medicines are easily available, there is an abundance of grain, the king governs the people properly, there are few hypocritical saints, begging is easy, and there is no obstacle in self-study. Shramans should not stay where there are many dogs. While contemplating the qualities and faults of those who take initiation, the commentary states that some individuals are inherently flawed due to their country's nature. A person born in Andhra is cruel. A person born in Maharashtra is talkative, and a person born in Kosala is inherently wicked. It is very rare to find such qualities absent in individuals.

The commentary further explains the method of collecting and returning materials for purposes like lying down, etc. It sheds light on the limitations of diet, stating that a monk who eats eight morsels is called an *alpahāri*, one who eats twelve, sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-one, and thirty-two morsels is called an *apārḍhāri*, *arḍhāri*, *prāptāvamoudarya*, and *pramaṇāhāri* respectively. The ninth *uddesaka* discusses the food intake of monks in relation to their relatives, friends, and other visitors, highlighting various paradigms. The tenth *uddesaka* focuses specifically on *yavamādhyapratimā* and *vanamādhyapratimā*. It also explains five types of conduct, the method of *bāladikshā*, ten types of *vaiyāvṛtti*, etc. Stories of *Prāyaṁ rakshit*, *Ārya kālak*, King *Sātavāhana*, *Pradyot*, *Murunda*, *Cāṇakya*, *Cilātaputra*, *Avanti*, *Sukumāla*, *Rohiney*, *Prārya samudra*, *Ārya mangu*, etc. are included. This commentary is significant in many ways. A *cūṇī* was also written on conduct. After the *cūṇī*, *Ācārya Malayagiri* wrote a *vṛtti* on conduct. The *vṛtti* clearly reflects the profound scholarship of *Ācārya Malayagiri*. The depth of the subject, the simplicity of the language, the elegance of the style, and the clarity of the analysis are noteworthy. The beginning of the text has a preface in the form of a *pīṭhikā*, which discusses topics like *kalpa*, conduct, faults, atonement, etc. The commentator, with devotion, has paid homage to *Arhat Ariṣṭanemi*, his revered guru, and the commentator of the *vyavahārasūtra*, etc. The commentator, while clarifying the difference between the *Bṛhatkalpa* and *vyavahāra*, writes that the study of *kalpa* deals with atonement, but it does not include the method of giving atonement, whereas *vyavahāra* includes both the method of giving atonement and the method of criticism. This is the special feature of *vyavahāra* compared to *Bṛhatkalpa*. Analyzing *vyavahāra*, *vyavahāri*, and *vyavahartavya*, he writes that *vyavahāri* is the doer, *vyavahāra* is the cause, and *vyavahartavya* is the action. The cause-like *vyavahāra* is of five types: *prāgama*, *śruta*, *ājñā*, *dhāraṇā*, and *jīta*. The *cūṛṇikāra* calls all five types of conduct *karaṇa*. The commentator considers *sūtra*, *artha*, *jītakalpa*, *mārga*, *nyāya*, *apsytavya*, *prācarita*, and *vyavahāra* to be synonymous. One who knows the essence of conduct and has the ability to explain the nature of conduct to others is called a *gītartha*. For a *gītartha*, the use of conduct is essential. Both the giver of atonement and the receiver of atonement should be *gītartha*. There are four meanings of atonement: *pratisevā*, *manyajanā*, *grāropaṇā*, and *parikūcanā*. There are ten types of atonement in the form of *pratisevā*. (1) *Ālocana*, (2) *pratikramāṇā*, (3) *tadu-bhaya*, (4) *viveka*, (5) *utsarga*, (6) *tapa*, (7) *chedha*, (8) *mūla*, (9) *anavasthāpya*, and (10) *pārāñcīka*. These ten types of atonement have been discussed in detail. If we compare these types of atonement with the atonement method found in the *Vinayapitaka*, we will find a surprising similarity. It is essential that the officer or *ācārya* who gives atonement be a *bahuśruta* and serious. In front of everyone, 1. *Vinayapitaka* diagnosis [70] 

Page #72:
---------------------------
Criticism is prohibited. Both criticism and atonement should be done in front of a worthy person, so that it can remain confidential. / In the Buddhist tradition, there is a provision for atonement in front of the community of monks. The Vinaya Pitaka states that on the Krishna Chaturdashi and Purnima of every month, all monks should gather in the Uposathagar. The Tathagata Buddha told his successor Sangha. Therefore, a learned monk is appointed to the post of head of the assembly and the Patimokkha is recited. At the end of each case, the question is asked whether all the monks present are pure in the said matters? If any monk wants to criticize his fault in this regard, the Sangha contemplates on it and purifies him. The same question is repeated for the second and third time. After everyone's approval, one by one cases are read further. Similarly, the nuns recite the Bhikkhuni Patimokkha. It is true that the atonement methods of both traditions are different. But both have psychological aspects. Both traditions expect the purity of heart and simplicity of thoughts of the seeker who is atoning. In the first objective, two types of atonement are mentioned: original atonement and subsequent atonement. / Original atonement is of five types: violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment. Subsequent atonement is of ten types. Subsequent atonement is in the form of future, past, with a limit, controlled, concrete, abstract, quantified, complete, symbolic and non-acceptance. In the above words, the ten types of subsequent atonement are: Pindavishuddhi, five samitis, external penance, internal penance, Bhikshapratima and Abhigha. Original atonement and subsequent atonement are also of two types: Darya and Kalpya. Atonement without reason is Dapka and atonement with reason is Kalpika. The commentator has presented discussions at various places to clarify the subject. / The present commentary has 34625 verses. After the commentary, short commentaries explaining the meanings of the Pragama in simple and easy-to-understand language have been written, whose language is a mixture of ancient Gujarati-Rajasthani. This is known as Balavabodh and Tabba. / Dharmasimha Muni of the Stanakvasi tradition has also written Tabba on the Vyavahar Sutra, but it is still unpublished. The Hindi translation of the Vyavahar Sutra by Acharya Amolkarishiji Maharaj has been published. Jivraj Ghelabhai Doshi has also published a Gujarati translation. Shubing Leipzig wrote it in 1918 with German commentary. / Which was published in 1923 by the Jain Sahitya Samiti, Pune. Pujya Ghasilalji M. has published the Cheda Sutras only with Sanskrit commentary. The Vyavahar Sutra was published in 1980 from Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao. Which was edited by Agammarmgy Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal". The present editor, Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal", had earlier edited and published the three Ved Sutras: Prayar-Dasha, Kappasuttam and Bahar Suttam. Based on the same, the present three Agamas are being edited and published in more detail. Nishita has already been published. This publication of the four Cheda Sutras with original, meaning and discussion is glorious in itself. With the publication of these three Pragama, [71]

The publication of the thirty-two *pagama* accepted by the *sthānakavāsī* tradition is also being completed from this present *āgama* series. The commendable vision of the late revered *yuvacharya* Shri Madhukar Muni Ji Maharaj has been given concrete form due to many editor *munis*, *mahāsatis* and scholars. This is a matter of supreme joy. The *chedasūtras* elaborate on the code of conduct of the *shramans*. The *chedasūtras* describe the path of *utsarga* and *apvāda*. I was thinking of writing about these in great detail, but due to the responsibility of the *shraman* community and being extremely busy with that work, and due to the very crowded environment, I could not write. I have this thought myself. I have written a very brief introductory preface. I hope that the discerning reader will understand the essence that remains in the *āgama*. As a result of the boundless grace of the great *rāṣṭrasanta* *āchāryasamrāt* Shri Anand Rishi Ji Maharaj and the most revered *pūjya* *gurudev* *upādhyāya* Shri Pushkar Muni Ji Maharaj, I have been able to do some work in the field of literature, and I am happy that I have been able to give concrete form to their inspiration by writing prefaces on *āgama* literature. I not only hope but have complete faith that discerning readers will enrich their lives by studying the *āgamas*. *Upāchārya* Devendra Muni Kot, Pipard City, Date 22-10-91 [72]

Page #88:
---------------------------
[268] According to the Prasevita, when criticizing with Maya, one should establish the appropriate Pariharatapas as a form of atonement and perform the necessary Vyavavritti. If, even after being established in the Pariharatapas, one commits any kind of Pratisesvana, then their entire atonement should be included in the previously given atonement. / 1. If the previously committed offense was criticized earlier, 2. If the previously committed offense was criticized later, 3. If the later committed offense was criticized earlier, 4. If the later committed offense was criticized later. / 1. If one resolved to criticize without Maya and criticized without Maya, 2. If one resolved to criticize without Maya and criticized with Maya, 3. If one resolved to criticize with Maya and criticized without Maya, 4. If one resolved to criticize with Maya and criticized with Maya. In any of these cases of transgression in criticizing, the atonement for the entire acknowledged offense should be combined and included in the previously given atonement. If one, having been established in this Pariharatapas as a form of atonement, commits any kind of Pratisesvana while undergoing it, then their entire atonement should also be imputed to the previously given atonement. Discussion - A Bhikshu or Bhikshuni, by observing restraint without transgression, naturally performs pure Paradhna. However, if, due to physical or other circumstances, they are compelled to consume something that is transgressive, even after a long period of practice, they can still purify themselves through criticism and atonement and continue their practice of restraint. / These sutras mention Pratisesvana, Alochana, Prayaschitta-sthana, Prasthapana, Praropana, etc. There are eighteen such sutras in the Nisitha Uddesaka 20. There, a detailed discussion of all these topics related to these sutras has been given. The commentator on the Pariharasthana mentioned in the sutras has given two meanings: 1. That which is to be abandoned, i.e., the place of the fault, and 2. That which is to be held, i.e., the atonement tapas. In these eighteen sutras, the word is used in the sense of "place of the fault," and in the concluding sutra of each Uddesaka of the Nisitha, it is used in the sense of "atonement tapas." / The conduct of Pariharikas and Apariharikas regarding Nishadya, etc. 19. If many Pariharikas and many Apariharikas, out of desire, wish to eat or drink something, or if they have already eaten or drunk something, then they should not be allowed to eat or drink anything without asking the Thera. If the Thera, without being asked, allows them to eat or drink something, then they should not be allowed to eat or drink anything.

## First Objective] [269 Theras should not be separated, and it is not proper for one to stay or sit together with them, whether they are in the state of Abhinisejja or Abhinisihiya. Theras should not be separated, and it is not proper for one to stay or sit together with them, whether they are in the state of Abhinisejja or Abhinisihiya. / If one stays or sits together with Theras without their permission, whether they are in the state of Abhinisejja or Abhinisihiya, then they are liable to a penance or a Parihara. 19. If many Pariharic Bhikkhus and many Apariharic Bhikkhus wish to stay or sit together, then it is not proper for them to do so without asking the Sthavir. / They can only stay or sit together after asking the Sthavir. If the Sthavir gives permission, then it is proper for them to stay or sit together. If the Sthavir does not give permission, then it is not proper for them to stay or sit together. / If they stay or sit together without the Sthavir's permission, then they are liable to a penance of Dikshached or Tap रूप for violating the rules. Discussion—The detailed method of performing Pariharatap is mentioned in Nisith U. 4, and some description is also given in U. 20 and Brihatkalp U. 4. / The food, residence, study, bed, and sitting of a Pariharic Bhikkhu are all separate even when they are living in a group. / Therefore, if a Sadhu needs to sit with a Pariharic for any particular reason, then it is necessary to take permission from the Sthavir, etc., who are the leaders of the group. / If the Sthavir deems it appropriate, then they give permission, otherwise, they prohibit it. Even after being prohibited, if someone sits together, they violate the rules, and if they sit together without asking or behave in any other way, they are violating the rules, which makes them liable for penance. The reason for not interacting with a Pariharic is that they should purify themselves by performing penance alone and achieve special Nirjara. The reason for making them perform penance while living in a group is to create fear in other Sadhus, so that they avoid committing sins.

## First Objective] [271 22. A Pariharakalp Bhikshu (with the permission of the Sthavir) goes to another sick Sthavir for Vyavritti, at that time the Sthavir may remind him or not, i.e. give permission to leave the Pariharatap or not, then it is Kalpta for him to go in the direction of the sick Sthavir, resting for one night in the villages etc. on the way, and if possible, carrying the Pariharatap. It is not Kalpta for him to stay on the way for the purpose of wandering, but it is Kalpta to stay due to illness etc. / If, after the cause is over, a Vaidya etc. says, "O Arya!

The Pariharic Bhikshu can go for service while performing his Prayschitta Tap or even by leaving the Tap. / The first Sutra states that if the Sthavir asks him to leave the Tap, then he should leave the Tap and go. The second Sutra states that if the Sthavir does not ask him to leave the Tap, then he should go carrying the Prayschitta Tap. / The third Sutra states that whether the Sthavir asks or not, if possible, he should go carrying the Pariharatap, and if not possible, then he should go after taking permission and leaving the Pariharatap. Whether the Pariharic Bhikshu goes performing the Tap or leaving the Tap, he should not stay at one place for more than one night on the way for rest. He cannot stay longer on the way for Dharma Pravahana or at someone's request, but if he wants to stay longer due to his own weakness or illness, then he can stay. If he stays for 5-10 days due to illness and needs treatment, then he can stay, and after recovering, he can stay for another one or two days at the behest of a Vaidya or a well-wisher. He does not incur any Prayschitta. / If, after recovering, he stays for more than two days voluntarily or at someone's behest, then he becomes eligible for the Tap or Chhed Prayschitta as per the violation of the limit. See the discussion of this Sutra-ansh in Brihatkalpasutra U. 2, Su. 4. _ One should go for Vyavritti by the direct path to the destination which is in accordance with the rules of restraint, but one should not go by any arbitrary path, spending more time.

##  272] [Vyavahar Sutra: The Return of a Solitary Wanderer to the Order]

23. If a monk, having left the order, practices solitary wandering, and later wishes to rejoin the same order, he should fully examine and perform *pratikramana* for his previous state. He should accept the *chhed* or *tapas* penance given by the *acharya* after listening to his criticism.

24. If a *ganavachchedak*, having left the order, practices solitary wandering, and later wishes to rejoin the same order, he should fully examine and perform *pratikramana* for his previous state. He should accept the *chhed* or *tapas* penance given by the *acharya* after listening to his criticism.

25. If an *ayariya* or *upajjhaya*, having left the order, practices solitary wandering, and later wishes to rejoin the same order, he should fully examine and perform *pratikramana* for his previous state. He should accept the *chhed* or *tapas* penance given by the *acharya* after listening to his criticism.

[First Objective] [273 also the word "Pratima" has been used / It would be completely inappropriate to imagine those who are Pratimadhari. There is a definite period for those who hold the twelve Pratimadharis or other Pratimadharis. They remain in Paradhna for that long. The terms "Dochchhapi" and "Ichchhajja" used in the Sutra are unnecessary for them / They practice various types of tapasya-sadhana etc. only after they take Pratima / Therefore, there is no reason to leave Pratima in between and it is also not appropriate to imagine the provision of tapasya or chhed pratyachit for the Pratimadhari bhikshu to come to the gachch after completing the Pratimadhari / Because the Shravaks who take Pratima are also so strong-willed that they do not keep any kind of praagar in their rules, i.e. even the praagar of the king etc. does not remain for them / Then how can the possibility of the Pratimadhari bhikshu being fickle-minded and being blamed be considered? In Sutra 31, there is a statement like "Nasti Kei Chhae Wa Parihare Wa, Nannasti Egaae Paloyanaae" for the ordinary bhikshu who takes the ling of other opinion, then the Pratimadhari bhikshu is of a much higher level of practice than that. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand that the provision and pratyachit done in these Sutras is in relation to those who leave the gachch voluntarily and take up eklavicharcharya / There are two types of eklavichara mentioned in the Agamas (1) Aparisthitika (2) Saparisthitika / Aparisthitika - The solitary stay of the bhikshus who take Pratimadharis is only for the purpose of nirjara, that is Aparisthitika eklavichara / The bhikshus who take Pratima do eklavichara with respect and with the permission of the Acharya of the gachch, therefore they are counted in the property of the Acharya / They are the knowers of the nine pasts / After completing the Pratima in eight months, they come to the gana with respect. Saparisthitika - due to physical-mental reasons, due to the disparity of nature, due to the non-availability of a cooperative partner who follows pure restraint, or due to the inability to follow the restraint method completely, the eklavichara that is taken voluntarily is called 'Saparisthitika eklavichara'. The bhikshu who follows Saparisthitika eklavicharcharya is not counted in the property of the Acharya. His leaving the gachch is not by permission or with respect, but by the indifference or opposition of the sangha. For the bhikshu who follows Saparisthitika eklavicharcharya, it is not mandatory to take Pratima, to be an excellent geetarth, or to have special qualifications, however, a navadishit (one who has taken diksha for less than three years), a balak (one who is less than 16 years old), and a tarun (one who is less than 40 years old) should not be an eklavichari. Because in Vyavaharsutra U. 3, there is a provision for these three to stay under the leadership of the Acharya Upadhyaya.

[276] [Vyavahar Sutra 2. A solitary wandering undertaken due to fear of the discipline of the Acharya etc., or to obtain a place, region, food, clothing etc. that is agreeable to the mind, or to see many places, is also called 'unjustified solitary wandering', and the solitary wandering of all those who are not on a pilgrimage is called 'unjustified solitary wandering'. In the present set of Sutras, the rules for solitary wandering and return to the group by the Acharya, Upadhyaya, Ganavachchedak and ordinary monks have been laid down. In essence, solitary wandering is of two types: justified and unjustified. Therefore, solitary wandering is both prohibited and prescribed in the Agamas. Solitary wandering undertaken for the reasons mentioned in the Agamas is justified and prescribed by the Agamas. Solitary wandering of those who are not on a pilgrimage, those who are not well-versed in the scriptures, and those who are not enlightened is strictly prohibited, and all three terms are synonymous. A monk who is lax in his vows, not vigilant, and has an abundance of passions like anger, pride etc., is considered to be engaged in unjustified solitary wandering, and it is called 'condemned solitary wandering'. Any solitary wandering monk, whether justified or unjustified, who wishes to return to the group, can be admitted to the group after proper examination and performance of appropriate penance. This is the essence of the three Sutras. The return to the group of those who are wandering in the vicinity etc. is as follows: 26. A monk who is wandering in the vicinity of the group, having been admitted to the group, if he wishes to return to the same group, having been admitted, and if there is any reason for it, he should be welcomed, readmitted, and his shortcomings should be rectified. 27. A monk who is wandering away from the group, having been admitted to the group, if he wishes to return to the same group, having been admitted, and if there is any reason for it, he should be welcomed, readmitted, and his shortcomings should be rectified. 28. A monk who is wandering away from the group, having been admitted to the group, if he wishes to return to the same group, having been admitted, and if there is any reason for it, he should be welcomed, and his shortcomings should be rectified. 29. A monk who is wandering away from the group, having been admitted to the group, if he wishes to return to the same group, having been admitted, and if there is any reason for it, he should be welcomed, readmitted, and his shortcomings should be rectified. 30. A monk who is wandering away from the group, having been admitted to the group, if he wishes to return to the same group, having been admitted, and if there is any reason for it, he should be welcomed, readmitted, and his shortcomings should be rectified.

## [Direct Objective] [277 26. If a monk leaves the order and adopts the Pārsva-sthavi-vihāra-caryā and later wants to return to the same order after abandoning the Pārsva-sthavi-vihāra, then if his conduct is somewhat remaining, he should perform a complete review and repentance of his previous state and accept whatever penance in the form of Diksha-chheda or tapas that the Acharya gives after listening to his review. 27. If a monk leaves the order and adopts the Yatha-chanda-vihāra-caryā and later wants to return to the same order after abandoning the Yatha-chanda-vihāra, then if his conduct is somewhat remaining, he should perform a complete review and repentance of his previous state and accept whatever penance in the form of Diksha-chheda or tapas that the Acharya gives after listening to his review. 28. If a monk leaves the order and adopts the Kuśila-vihāra-caryā and later wants to return to the same order after abandoning the Kuśila-vihāra, then if his conduct is somewhat remaining, he should perform a complete review and repentance of his previous state and accept whatever penance in the form of Diksha-chheda or tapas that the Acharya gives after listening to his review. 29. If a monk leaves the order and adopts the Avasanna-vihāra-caryā and later wants to return to the same order after abandoning the Avasanna-vihāra, then if his conduct is somewhat remaining, he should perform a complete review and repentance of his previous state and accept whatever penance in the form of Diksha-chheda or tapas that the Acharya gives after listening to his review. 30. If a monk leaves the order and adopts the Samsakta-vihāra-caryā and later wants to return to the same order after abandoning the Samsakta-vihāra, then if his conduct is somewhat remaining, he should perform a complete review and repentance of his previous state and accept whatever penance in the form of Diksha-chheda or tapas that the Acharya gives after listening to his review.  /  The previous sūtras mention the return of a solitary monk to the order, and these sūtras mention the return of monks with relaxed conduct like Pārsva-sthavi etc. to the order.  /  These sūtras also make it clear that the restraint mentioned in the previous sūtras for solitary monks is not relaxed, but they are those who follow pure conduct. When Pārsva-sthavi etc. want to return to the order, if their restraint has not been completely destroyed by their corrupt tendencies, i.e., if any of the qualities of restraint remain, then they can be admitted to the order after giving them penance in the form of tapas or chheda.  _ This statement about the remaining restraint is not found in the previous sūtras, all other provisions are the same in both places. Therefore, these should be understood as before.  /  These sūtras provide an alternative provision for penance in the form of tapas or chheda, i.e., a solitary monk or Pārsva-sthavi etc. can be admitted to the order after giving them tapas penance, and someone can also be given Diksha-chheda penance, therefore, it should not be understood as a single provision. 

Page #98:
---------------------------
##  [278] It is extremely important to test and gather information about the discipline of any monk seeking re-entry into the Gachchha, whether they follow strict or relaxed practices. 

1. It is crucial to assess whether a monk who wishes to live independently can abide by the Gachchha's conduct, thoughts, and disciplinary rules. 
2. Why does he desire to return to the Gachchha, leaving behind Parśvasthavihāra, etc.? Is it due to pure or impure motives? 
3. Is he seeking re-entry out of fear of Pariṣaha-upsarga, humiliation, etc.? 
4. What are his future intentions and how will he achieve them? 
5. Are his intentions to remain in the Gachchha stable or not? 

After considering these points, a decision should be made that benefits both the monk and the Gachchha. To make the right decision, the monk can be kept under observation for a period of time, even up to six months, without formally admitting him into the Gachchha. This allows for a proper assessment of whether to accept him or not. 

The reason for these considerations is to prevent the monk from harming the Gachchha, its other monks, or the Sangha. This includes causing discord, criticizing the Gachchha or its leaders, leaving the Gachchha again, misleading other monks to leave the Gachchha, etc. Such actions would lead to harm for the monk, the Gachchha, and Jainism. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider all aspects before accepting a returning monk. 

Similar precautions should be taken for monks visiting from other Gachchhas. 

For a detailed explanation of Parśvasth, Avasanna, Kuśīla, and Sansakta, refer to Niśītha U. 4. 

For a detailed explanation of Yathachanda, refer to Niśītha U. 10. 

Here is a brief explanation:

1. **Parśvasth:** One who does not strive for knowledge, philosophy, and virtuous conduct, but instead indulges in excesses and misconduct, is called a "Parśvasth."
2. **Yathachanda:** One who follows self-made interpretations or practices contrary to the Agamas is called a "Yathachanda."
3. **Kuśīla:** One who engages in forbidden activities like learning, mantras, divination, or healing, which are incompatible with a disciplined life, is called a "Kuśīla."
4. **Avasanna:** One who deviates from the rules of disciplined conduct or follows them partially is called an "Avasanna."
5. **Sansakta:** One who follows the strict practices of those with high conduct and becomes lax with those who follow relaxed practices is called a "Sansakta."

These Parśvasth, etc., are considered lax because they have flaws in their discipline. However, Bhagavati...

[First Objective] [279 Sutra Sh. 25 U. 6 describes Bakush and Pratisevnakushila Nirgranth. They are called Nirgranth even though they consume dosha. The reason for this is - 1. The monk who consumes dosha without any compelling circumstance. 2. The one who does not purify himself after consuming dosha in a compelling circumstance. 3. The one who accepts contrary conduct to the limits of restraint forever is called "Shithilachari Parsvasthadi". The monk who consumes dosha due to a compelling circumstance, later purifies himself by performing atonement. Upon being relieved of the special circumstance, he abandons the sinful tendencies, he is not called "Shithilachari Parsvasthadi" but is called Bakush or Pratisevna Nirgranth and pure-conduct. In deciding between pure-conduct and Shithilachari, it is also worth considering that the one who does not follow the limits of restraint which are clearly stated in the Agamas, can be called Shithilachari, but the one who does not follow the limits which are not stated in the Agamas, which are prevalent by tradition or are determined and practiced by the Gachch community or individual, it is completely inappropriate to consider such a person as Shithilachari. It is necessary for the members of the community or Gachch to follow the rules of their Gachch or community for discipline. Because the one who does not follow the rules of his Gachch is a Gachch Samachari and a violator of the Guru's command. But a Sadhu Sadhvi belonging to a different Gachch cannot be called Shithilachari or a violator of the Guru's command for following those rules. A list of such Samachari rules is given in Nisith U. 13. The inquisitive reader should carefully look at it. The order of these five Sutras of Parsvasthadi etc. in Nisith Sutra Uddeshak 4 and Uddeshak 13 is as follows: 1. Parsvastha 2. Avasanna 3. Kushila 4. Sansakta 5. Nityaka / But the order in the present Sutra and its commentary is as follows: 1. Parsvastha 2. Yathachanda 3. Kushila 4. Avasanna 5. Sansakta / It is not known whether this difference in order is from the original composition or from the passage of time or from a scribal error / No consideration has been given to this matter in the commentary. The commentary states that many Parsvasthadi wander around self-deprecating and praising the virtuous, many Parsvasthadi take shelter in the time and place to defend their lax conduct and build their reputation through knowledge, mantras, means etc. and also criticize the virtuous. Parsvasthadi etc. are also in the Mahavidehakshetra and are also in the reign of all Tirthankaras. _ Among these Parsvasthadi etc., Yathachanda Sadhu is the one who does the most harm to himself and to the Jinasasana.

## Translation:

**280] It should be understood that the meaning of these [Vyavahar Sutra] is that all those who are like Parsva [i.e., those who have taken refuge in the Jain faith] are worthy of compassion and if they wish to join the assembly of the virtuous after attaining right understanding, they can be included in the Gachchha after assessing their eligibility.  **

**31. If a monk leaves the assembly and lives in another gender due to some specific circumstance and wishes to rejoin the assembly after the cause is over, then he should be allowed to live in the same assembly after rejoining. There is no need for any atonement like Diksha-Chhed or Tapas for him, except for the censure for changing gender. **

**Discussion:** If a monk leaves the assembly due to the influence of passions and adopts another gender, and later wishes to rejoin his own Gachchha, then he can be included in the Gachchha only after giving him atonement like Diksha-Chhed or the original initiation. However, the meaning of the prohibition of atonement like Diksha-Chhed etc. in the present Sutra is that if a monk, due to unbearable troubles, changes his physical gender to protect his inner restraint, or if the king of a country is hostile to the Jain religion and the non-scriptural monks, then he changes his gender for the time he has to stay in that area or to travel through that area. Later, if he wants to live with the monks of the Gachchha after adopting his original gender, then he is not given any atonement like Chhed or Tapas for changing gender, except for the censure for changing gender. The statement in Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 25, Verse 7, about the Chhed-Upastapaniya-Charitra in the case of a householder's gender and another gender, is also in this context. Here, in the Sutra, the word 'Parapasand' is used along with the word 'Padim', yet this is not the 'Bhikshu Pratima' mentioned in the Sutra, but it should be understood as a specific style of using words in the ancient tradition. For more information, see the discussion of Sutra 23. **

**32. If a monk leaves the assembly due to lack of restraint and wishes to rejoin the same assembly after attaining right understanding, then he should be allowed to live in the same assembly after rejoining. There is no need for any atonement like Chhed or Tapas for him, except for the censure for leaving the assembly. **

## First Objective] 261 32. If a monk leaves the order and abandons his vows, and later wishes to be accepted back into the same order, the only atonement for him is "Chhedopasthapana" (re-initiation). He is not given any other atonement like Dikshachhed or Parihar Tap etc. Discussion - If a monk, due to fear of the restrictions of vows and the hardships of the path, or due to the influence of passions, abandons his vows and takes up the life of a householder, and later wishes to accept the vows again, and it seems beneficial to give him initiation, then he can be re-initiated. But he is not given any atonement for leaving the order and abandoning his vows, because re-initiation itself becomes his complete atonement. In the first chapter of the Dashavakalik Sutra, the eighteen stages are described in detail and in a heart-wrenching manner to stabilize the unsteady mind in the path of vows. In the end, it is said that this suffering arising in the path of vows is temporary and insignificant compared to the suffering of hell for countless years, and for those who delight in the path of vows, even that suffering becomes a great source of happiness. Therefore, one should delight in the path of vows. The pleasures of the senses are not permanent, but they only increase the chain of suffering. Therefore, the seeker should firmly resolve that "Chaijj Deha Na Hu Dhammasasanam", meaning "Even if I have to give up my entire body, I will never abandon the Dharma-Shasan, i.e., the path of vows." Monks who abandon their vows or do not delight in the path of vows experience great remorse in the future. Other scriptures also advise to remain steadfast in the path of vows and not to accept back the household life and worldly pleasures that were abandoned under any circumstances. Therefore, if during the time of practicing vows, the thought of abandoning vows arises due to worldly desires, passions, or intolerance, then it should be immediately nullified by the many teachings of the scriptures. 

## Criticism 33. (1) If a monk wishes to be criticized, having served another place of penance, where he has not been able to practice his own vows, then he should be criticized until he performs the atonement for his wrong deeds. (2) If he has not been able to practice his own vows, but has been able to practice the vows of the community, many times, then he should be criticized until he performs the atonement for his wrong deeds. (3) If he has not been able to practice the vows of the community, many times, but has been able to practice the vows of another community, many times, then he should be criticized until he performs the atonement for his wrong deeds. (4) If he has not been able to practice the vows of another community, many times, but has been able to practice the vows of the righteous, many times, then he should be criticized until he performs the atonement for his wrong deeds.

[282] (5) If a monk does not find a *sarūpya* (similarly-practicing) monk who is *bahuśruta* (well-versed in the scriptures) and *bahumāgam* (knowledgeable of many *āgamas*), he should approach a *paścātkṛta* (lapsed) *śramaṇopāsaka* (lay follower) who is *bahuśruta* and *bahumāgam* and confess his misdeed to him. If he does not do so, he should perform the appropriate *prāyaścitta* (penance) and *tapo-karma* (austerity). (6) If he does not find a *paścātkṛta* *śramaṇopāsaka* who is *bahuśruta* and *bahumāgam*, he should approach a *samyak-bhāvita* (rightly-minded) *jñānī-puruṣa* (knowledgeable person) and confess his misdeed to him. If he does not do so, he should perform the appropriate *prāyaścitta* and *tapo-karma*. (7) If he does not find a *samyak-bhāvita* *jñānī-puruṣa*, he should go outside the village or city, facing east or north, with his palms joined and his head bowed, and say, "I am a *pravaraha* (one who has gone astray), I am *pravaraddha* (one who has fallen from the path)." He should then confess his misdeed to the *arihantās* (liberated souls) and *siddhas* (perfected beings). If he does not do so, he should perform the appropriate *prāyaścitta* and *tapo-karma*.

## First Objective:

**[283 "I have so many faults and I have indulged in them so many times," by saying this, one should criticize in front of Arihants and Siddhas until they accept the appropriate penance in the form of tapasya. When, due to circumstances or negligence, one who is practicing restraint violates the boundaries of Shraman Dharma, and commits an act that is not in accordance with the Dharma, then it is essential to criticize oneself promptly and without negligence. This is an essential part of a life of restraint. This is the first type of internal penance.**

**Uttara. A. 29 states that the fruit of criticism is that the critic, by criticizing themselves, removes the internal thorns, the faults that hinder the path to liberation, and the karmas that increase the cycle of endless births and deaths from their soul, i.e., destroys them. Both the critic and the listener of the criticism should be endowed with the qualities mentioned in the Agamas. Only then will the desired worship be successful. Nisitha U. 20 provides information about many topics related to criticism, including location references, which the reader can refer to. The present sutra provides a sequence of who one should criticize in front of. This means that, as far as possible, one should criticize in this sequence. If one criticizes in reverse order, the commentary on page 126 (one hundred twenty-six) mentions Guruchaumasi and Laghuchaumasi penance. Therefore, a monk who wishes to criticize should first criticize in front of their Acharya or Upadhyaya. If, for any reason, the Acharya or Upadhyaya is not available, i.e., they are ill or away, and the monk's own lifespan is short, then they should criticize in front of a Sambhogik Sadhu who shares their food and conduct. However, this ordinary monk should also be endowed with the qualities of listening to criticism, be well-versed (proficient in the Cheda Sutras), and knowledgeable about many Agamas (a student of many Sutras and their meanings). If such a qualified Sambhogik Sadhu is not available, then one should criticize in front of an Asambhogik (one who does not share food) monk who is well-versed and possesses other qualities. This Asambhogik monk should be virtuous. If a virtuous Asambhogik Sadhu is also not available, then one should criticize in front of a monk of the same gender who is well-versed and possesses other qualities. Here, the meaning of "same gender" is that regardless of their conduct, one can criticize in front of them. If such a monk is not available, then one can criticize in front of someone who has abandoned restraint and is following the Shramanopasakaparyaya, and who is well-versed and possesses other qualities. Up to this point, it has been stated that one should criticize in front of someone who knows about penance and purify oneself. In the previous two options, the critic themselves accepts the penance. In the first option, one should criticize in front of someone who is a Samyagdarshi, who is deeply affected by the Jina's teachings, or someone who is impartial, gentle in nature, and understanding. The second option states that if such a person is not available, then one should criticize outside the village, etc.**

---------------------------
[284] In a secluded place, one should criticize the Arhats or Siddhas in their memory, speaking in a loud voice, and should accept the appropriate atonement oneself. The last two options should be understood for the Gītartha Bhikshu, because the Agītartha Bhikshu is incapable of accepting atonement himself. In the Bhāṣyaṭīkā, this sūtra is explained as follows: "Suttamiṇam kāraṇiyam, āriyādīṇ jaththagacchammī / Pañcaṇhaṁ hī asati, ego ca tahiṁ na vasiyavvam // Ṭīkā-sūtramidam adhikṛtam kāranika, kārane bhavam kāranikaṁ, kārane satyekākīvihāraviṣayam ityārthaḥ / Iyamatrā bhavanā bahūnī khalu aśivādīnī ekākītva kāraṇānī, tataḥ kāranavaśato yo jātaḥ ekākī tadviṣayamidam sūtram iti na kaścid doṣaḥ. Aśivādīnī tu kāraṇānī muktvā ācāryādivirahitasyā na vartate vastu.  Tathā āha-yatra gacche pañcānām ācāryopādhyāyagaṇāvacchedīpravṛtisthadhirarūpāṇām asadbhavo yadi vā yatra pañcānām anyatamo'pyeko na vidyate tatra na vasatavyam anekadosa sambhavāt /  In this explanation, the sūtra's injunction is said to be for a Bhikshu who is solitary due to a reason, and many reasons for being solitary are also mentioned /  which has been explained in the discussion of sūtras 23-25. The meaning of the words "ālocanā" etc. used in the sūtra is as follows: "Āloejjā" - to reveal transgressions etc. by speech / "Paḍikkamejjā" - to admit one's mistakes and wrong deeds / "Nidejjā" - to condemn one's misconduct to oneself, i.e. to feel remorse in one's heart / "Garehejjā" - to condemn one's misconduct to one's Guru, to express remorse / "Viuddejjā" - to refrain from misconduct / "Visohejjā" - to purify oneself, i.e. to completely refrain from misconduct / "Prakaraṇayāe anmuṭṭhajjā" - to make a firm resolve not to repeat the act of misconduct / "Prahārihaṁ tavokammaṁ pāyacchittaṁ paḍivajjejjā" - to accept atonement such as penance according to the nature of the fault. Only by performing the entire process from criticism to accepting atonement does one achieve self-purification, and only then does criticism become meaningful. The explanation of the 16 words "grāma" etc. that appear in the sūtra is given in Niśītha U. 4 and Bṛhatkalpa U. 1, so see them there. The order of criticism mentioned in the sūtra is as follows: 1. Prācārya Upādhyāya, 2. Sārmaka Sāmbhogika Bahuśruta Bahu-āgamajña Bhikshu, 3. Sārmaka Anya Sāmbhogika Bahuśruta Bahu-prāgamajña Bhikshu, 4. Sārūpika Bahuśruta Bahu-āgamajña Bhikshu, 5. Paścātkṛta

## First Objective:

[285 Bahushruta Bahu-Agamjna Shravak, 6. Samyak Bhavit Jnani, i.e. Samyagdristi, a wise person, 7. Go outside the village, etc., and criticize in the presence of Arihant Siddhas / Here, Bahushruta Bahu-Agamjna is not present in three positions (1) Acharya Upadhyaya are generally Bahushruta Bahu-Pagamjna, therefore, there is no need for this adjective for them. In Brihatkalpa Bhashya Ga. 691-692, it is said that Acharya, etc., degree holders are generally Geetaarth / General Bhikshu are of both Geetaarth and Ageetartha types / (2) Samyagdristi or a wise person does not necessarily have to be Bahushruta. He is only eligible to listen to criticism and the Geetaarth critic Bhikshu himself accepts the atonement. (3) Arihant-Siddh Bhagwan are omniscient and all-seeing. There is no need for this adjective for them. The word "Samm Bhaviai Cheiyaai" is used in the sutra, which the commentator has interpreted as "Tasyapyabhave Yatrava Samyagbhavitani-Jinavachanavasitaantaha Karanani Devataani Pashyati Tatragatva Teshamantrike Palocheyat / In the absence of Shramanopasak, if one sees such a deity whose heart is perfumed by the words of Jina, then go to him and criticize him / Here, the commentator has interpreted the word "Cheiyaai" as "Devatā" and called him the one whose inner self is influenced by the words of Jina / Many meanings of the word "Cheiy" are given in the dictionary. In it, the meanings of "Jnani", "Bhikshu", etc., are also for the word "Cheiy" / In many sutras, the word "Cheiy" is used for Tirthankara Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, where that word is used to call Bhagwan "Jnani". In Upasakadasha A. 1, there is a vow related to the samkrit of Shramanopasak. In it, there is a prohibition on accepting Chetya, i.e., the virtuous, from other than the Tirthika, and on bowing, saluting, and talking to them, and on giving them food and water / There, the word "Cheiy" is clearly used in the sense of Bhikshu. The word "Cheiy" used in the present sutra also means "the idol of Arihant Bhagwan" belonging to the idol-worshipping community, but it is contrary to the meaning of the commentator and also contradicts the previous and subsequent sutras. Because the commentator has used the word "Antahkaran" here, it cannot be in the idol / The sutra says to go outside the village, etc., for the sake of Arihant Siddha's witness in the absence of Samyak Bhavit Chaitya. If the meaning of Arihant Chaitya was a temple, then there would have been a statement to criticize in the temple itself in the presence of Arihant Siddha, there would have been no need to give a separate option to go outside the village. Therefore, it is appropriate to interpret the word "Cheiy" in the present case as "Jnani or wise man".

**Criticism:**

* If a monk criticizes another without deceit, after observing the *prāyaścitta* (penance) for one to six months, once or multiple times, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of the same duration.

* If the *prāyaścitta* is for six months or more, the *prāyaścitta* remains six months.
* If a monk, while undergoing *prāyaścitta*, criticizes another with any of the four *cāubhangī* (types of criticism), he should be accused after completing the *prāyaścitta*.

**Parivārika and Aparivārika Monks:**

    5. In their absence, approach a *bahuśruta* *śramaṇopāsaka* (lay follower) who has abandoned initiation.
    6. In their absence, approach a *samyagdṛṣṭi* (right-seeing) or *samabhāvi* (equanimous) *jñānī* (knower) and accept the *prāyaścitta* himself.

##  Rules for the Performance of Parihara Tapa by Fellow Sadhus

1. If two Sadhus are traveling together and one of them criticizes another by engaging in an Akṛtyasthāna, then the other Sadhu should establish the criticizing Sadhu in Parihara Tapa and perform the Vyāvartya for him.

2. If two Sadhus are traveling together and both of them criticize each other by engaging in an Akṛtyasthāna, then one of them should be established as the Kalpāka (leader) and the other should perform the Parihara Tapa. After the completion of the Parihara Tapa, the Kalpāka should also perform the Parihara Tapa.

3. If many Sadhus are traveling together and one of them criticizes another by engaging in an Akṛtyasthāna, then the senior Sthavira among them should establish the criticizing Sadhu in Parihara Tapa and appoint another Sadhu to perform the Vyāvartya for him.

4. If many Sadhus are traveling together and all of them criticize each other by engaging in an Akṛtyasthāna, then one of them should be established as the Kalpāka (leader) and the rest should perform the Parihara Tapa. After the completion of the Parihara Tapa, the Kalpāka should also perform the Parihara Tapa.

5. If a Bhikkhu who is performing Parihara Tapa criticizes another by engaging in an Akṛtyasthāna, then he should be allowed to continue his Parihara Tapa. If he is able to control himself, then he should be established in Parihara Tapa and the Vyāvartya should be performed for him. If he is unable to control himself, then he should be subjected to Anu-Parihara. If he is able to control himself during Anu-Parihara, then he should be allowed to continue his Parihara Tapa. If he is unable to control himself, then he should be subjected to Koṛamāṇa. If he is able to control himself during Koṛamāṇa, then he should be allowed to continue his Parihara Tapa. If he is unable to control himself, then he should be subjected to Sāijja. If he is able to control himself during Sāijja, then he should be allowed to continue his Parihara Tapa. If he is unable to control himself, then he should be subjected to Āruheyabva.

[Second Objective] [289 5. A monk who is undergoing Pariharatapaschitta (penance in the form of Pariharatapas) and criticizes the service provided by a practitioner of a particular system of medicine when he is ill, should be given Pariharatapaschitta penance by the Acharya (spiritual teacher) and others, and his necessary service should be provided, if he is capable of performing Pariharatapas. If he is not capable, then the Acharya and others should appoint an Anupariharic (attendant) monk for his care. If the Pariharic (penitent) monk, despite being strong, takes care from the Anupariharic monk, then his penance should also be imposed along with the previous penance. Discussion - The method of performing Pariharatapas under the guidance of the Acharya and others has been described in the previous objective and in the Brihatkalpa U. 4. These sutras prescribe the automatic performance of Pariharatapas by two or more wandering Sarmic (Jain) monks. If two wandering Sarmic monks are Gitarya (those who have taken the vow of silence) and are wandering in a distant area away from the Acharya and others, or are wandering without the guidance of any Acharya, and one of them needs to perform Pariharatapas for the purification of a fault, then the other Gitarya monk becomes his Anupariharic and Kalpak (one who takes the lead). If both of them have committed a fault together and both need to perform Pariharatapas for purification, then after one monk completes his tapas, the other monk can perform tapas. That is, both cannot perform Pariharatapas together, because one needs to be Kalpak or Anupariharic. If many Sarmic monks are wandering, then the same should be understood regarding the performance of Pariharatapas by one or more of them, that is, one can be kept as Kalpak and the rest of the monks can perform Pariharatapas. The fifth sutra states specifically that if the Pariharic monk is slightly ill and has committed a fault, then the penance related to that fault should also be imposed in the previous tapas. If he does not have the strength to perform tapas, then he should stop performing tapas and after regaining strength, he should perform that penance and complete it. If the Pariharic monk is generally ill and can perform tapas with the service of an Anupariharic, then the penance obtained again should be imposed along with the previous tapas and service should be provided as needed. If the ill monk becomes healthy or strong in between, then he should not be served. Even after becoming healthy and strong, if he takes service, then he also incurs penance, because a monk performing Pariharatapas cannot take help or service from anyone through the Utsarga (renunciation) ritual.

## 292] [Vyavahar Sutra 12. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Unmada (mania) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak / Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta. 13. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Upsarga (affliction) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak. Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta / 14. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Kalaha (quarrel) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak. Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta. 15. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Prayschitta (penance) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak / Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta. 16. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Bhakta-Pratyakhyani (rejection of devotion) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak. Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta. 17. Expelling a Glana-Bhiksu suffering from Prayojana-vista (desire-filled) from the gana does not pertain to his Ganavcchedak. Until he is free from that disease-terror, he should be served with A-Glana-bhava. After that, the Ganavcchedak should establish him in an Atyalp Prayschitta. Discussion- These sutras mention Bhikshus in twelve different states. All these Bhikshus are also ill along with their states / If the Bhikshus serving them experience regret, even then it is the duty of the responsible Geetarth Ganavcchedak to not neglect the service of that Bhiksu and not separate him from the Gachchha, but to have him served with A-Glana-bhava by other service-minded Bhikshus / In the Bhashya, A-Glana-bhava is defined as serving with interest or enthusiasm, or serving with the understanding of one's duty / These sutras emphasize the following qualities: 1. Service, 2. Compassion for the Glana, 3. Reputation of the Sangha / Service is a prominent quality in the life of restraint and it is an inner penance, which is discussed in detail in Nishita U. 10. In Thananga Sutra A. 3 U. 4 and Bhag Sha. 8 U. 8, three are said to be worthy of compassion: 1. Tapasvi (one who performs severe penance), 2. Glana, 3. Navadishita / These present sutras also state that in any situation or during the period of penance, if a Bhiksu is ill, he should not be neglected and should not be expelled from the gana. 

Page #113:
---------------------------
The second objective [293] states that proper arrangements for the service (**Vyayavritti**) of **Glan-Bhikshus** (sick monks) enhance the reputation of the **Gachchha** (order) and **Jinshasan** (Jain religious system) and promote the influence of Dharma (religion). However, in the absence of proper arrangements, neglecting the service of a sick monk, becoming disheartened and abandoning service, expelling him from the **Gachchha**, or handing him over to other family members, leads to disrespect or criticism of the **Gachchha** and **Jinshasan**. Therefore, these chapters clarify that even monks in these conditions should not be neglected in their illness, but should be served with **Aglan-bhav** (without aversion). If they are not sick, they can be expelled from the **Gachchha** if necessary. The twelve conditions mentioned in the sutras are as follows: 1. **Pariharatappa** (performing penance for minor offenses). 2. **Navma Anvasthapy Prayaschitta** (performing penance for the ninth category of offenses). 3. **Dasva Paranchik Prayaschitta** (performing penance for the tenth category of offenses). 4. **Unmatta** (disturbed mind due to extreme sorrow or fear). 5. **Unmatta** (confused mind due to excessive joy). 6. **Yakshavesha** (afflicted by spirits or ghosts). 7. **Mohodaya** (madness due to delusion). 8. **Upsarga** (afflicted by a deity, animal, or king). 9. **Kashaya-Kalha** (afflicted by intense passions). 10. **Prayaschitta-prapta** (obtained penance for a major offense). 11. **Prajeevan Anashan** (vowed lifelong fasting). 12. **Vyakul** (disturbed by desires like seeking discipleship, position, etc.). The commentator interprets the word "**Nijjhittae**" used in these sutras not as expulsion from the **Gachchha**, but as simply not neglecting their service. He further explains the word "**Attajayam**" as "a monk who desires wealth for his distressed family members." The commentator considers it appropriate to interpret the word "**Arth-jat**" in the context of the above eleven conditions and the provisions mentioned in the sutras as "a monk who is overwhelmed by desires." While explaining the sutra "**Prahalahusae namam vavhare pattaviyatve sia**," the commentator has categorized various types of **Yatha-Ladhu** (minor) and **Yatha-Guru** (major) **Vavhar** (conduct) and has provided guidance on the time and penance to be performed for them. While explaining the word "**Vavhar**" in the sutras, he has stated that **Vavhar**, **Palochana** (criticism), **Vishuddhi** (purification), and **Prayaschitta** (penance) are synonymous. The word "**Parihar**" in the initial sutras of the first objective also denotes the meaning of penance, as in "**Bhikkhu ya masiyam pariharatthanam padisavitta paloezzja**" (A monk should criticize himself after performing penance for a month for a punishable offense). The word "**Parihar**" is also used in the sense of penance in the last sutra of the 19 objectives of the **Nishisth Sutra**.

##  294] [Meaning of _Yathalghushk_ Prāyaścitta in Vyavahārasūtra _  He completes the _Yathalghushk_ conduct by performing the five-day _nirvikṛti_ / If, in the _Yathalghushk_ conduct, the _pratipanna_ conduct is to be established, then the _tapas_ prāyaścitta is performed only by way of _ālocanā_ and _dāna_, because of the diligent service to the cause / —Commentary/Bha. Ga. 96 Meaning- The _laghu_ prāyaścitta is of five days, which is completed by abandoning the transgressions. Or, if the transgression is committed due to diligent service to the cause, or if the transgression is committed due to a very small violation, or if the transgression is committed due to helplessness, then it can be purified only by the _ālocanā_ prāyaścitta, i.e., it is not given the _tapas_ prāyaścitta. And since it is the first of the ten types of prāyaścittas, it is called 'Yathalghushk', i.e., _laghu_ (the most insignificant) prāyaścitta. _In these sūtras and in the following sūtras, the instruction of the _gaṇāvacchedaka_ is given instead of the instruction of the _ācārya_ _upādhyāya_ / This makes it clear that the _gaṇāvacchedaka_ is primarily responsible for the tasks of service and prāyaścitta in the _gaccha_ / The establishment of the _anavasthāpya_ and _pāraṃcīka_ monks 18. _Praṇavaṭṭhapannaṃ bhikku apihibhūyaṃ no kappati tassa gaṇāvaccheiyassa uvaṭṭhāvittae_. 19. _Aṇavaṭṭhapannaṃ bhikku gihibhūyaṃ kappati tassa gaṇāvaccheiyassa uvaṭṭhāvittae_. 20. _Pāraṃciyaṃ bhikku aghihibhūyaṃ no kappati tassa gaṇāvaccheiyassa uvaṭṭhāvittae_. 21. _Pāraṃciyaṃ bhikku gihibhūyaṃ kappati tassa gaṇāvaccheiyassa uvaṭṭhāvittae_ / 22. _Aṇavaṭṭhapannaṃ bhikku pāraṃciyaṃ vā bhikku aghihibhūyaṃ vā gihibhūyaṃ vā, kappati tassa gaṇāvaccheiyassa uvaṭṭhāvittae, jahā tassa gaṇassa pattiyaṃ siyā_. 18.

Page #115:
---------------------------
## Second Objective] [295 It is permissible for the Ganavacchedaka to reinstate a householder into the order of monks even without making him wear the garb of a householder, so that the welfare of the Gan can be achieved. In the ninth and tenth pratyakshita-yogya bhikṣu, a specific penance in the form of tapas is given to the bhikṣu for six months in the case of a minor offense and for twelve years in the case of a major offense. After the completion of the tapas, he is made to wear the garb of a householder once. After that, he is given the chhedopasthapanīya charitra. In the above four sutras, the provision of making him wear the garb of a householder has been stated, and in the fifth sutra, an exception has been stated. The meaning of this is that if it seems appropriate not to make a particular person a householder, then the Ganavacchedaka can do so according to his own decision. That is, he can do whatever is most beneficial to the Gachchha or the Jinasasana. The commentator has stated some reasons for not making him a householder: 1. The one who has made a king favorable to the Sangha. 2. The one for whom a king has requested that he should not be made a householder. 3. The one who has been given this pratyakshita by the sadhus of the Gan due to false accusations out of hatred, and he goes to another Gan and criticizes them. 4. The one who has many disciples who request that the pratyakshita-prapta bhikṣu or the acharya should not be made a householder. 5. The one who has many disciples who are ready to leave the order due to the harsh pratyakshita given to their benefactor. 6. The one who has a dispute with two Gans regarding the pratyakshita. In such circumstances, and for other such reasons, the bhikṣu should be reinstated without making him a householder. 

## Accusation of Akṛtyasevana and the Method of Deciding It 23. Two sāhम्मिया are wandering together, one of them criticizes the other for serving an akṛtyasthāna. 

Page #116:
---------------------------
**The Conduct Sutra**

"O Bhagavan! I have consumed a transgression with such and such a Sadhu due to such and such a reason." (Upon hearing this) one should ask the other Sadhu, "Are you a *pratisevi* or an *apratisevi*?" If he says, "I am a *pratisevi*," then he is eligible for atonement. If he says, "I am not a *pratisevi*," then he is not eligible for atonement, and one should make a decision based on whatever evidence he provides.

**Question:** O Bhagavan! What is the reason for saying this?

**Answer:** The atonement depends on the truthful statement of the *bhikshus* who have taken the vow of truth.

**Discussion:** If a *bhiksu* finds out while wandering and criticizes another *Sadhu* by saying that he has consumed a transgression, then this statement may be motivated by hatred towards the other *Sadhu* or by a desire to make him appear inferior in the *dikshaparaya*. Therefore, he makes a false accusation and pretends to be guilty himself in order to prove his accusation true. The commentator has also said that he may even admit to sexual misconduct with himself and other *bhikshus* while criticizing. In this way, he wants to defame the other *Sadhu* by deceit.

In such a situation, the scriptural scholar has given the following measures for making a wise decision:

The *geetarth* *bhiksu* who hears the criticism should not make any decision until he has obtained complete information from the other *bhiksu*. If, upon questioning, the other *bhiksu* does not admit to consuming the transgression and provides some explanation, then he should listen carefully. Thereafter, one should inquire about the place (field) of the transgression or the person involved in the transgression from the accuser. Then, one should make a decision after carefully considering the statements and evidence of both. If there is no strong evidence, then the *bhiksu* who denies the transgression should not be given any atonement. Whether the accuser has consumed the transgression or not, he is liable for atonement for making a false accusation.

If the critic is speaking the truth, but the other *bhiksu* does not admit his fault and the critic cannot prove it, then the one who denies the fault cannot be given any atonement. This is because *bhikshus* are bound by the vow of truth. Therefore, atonement can only be given if he admits it himself. He cannot be given atonement simply on the basis of someone else's statement without evidence.

The critic must prove the truth of his statement, and the *geetarth* atonement giver must understand the truth of the evidence and the *bhiksu* involved must admit the fault, only then is atonement given. If, even after the fault is proven, the *bhiksu* involved does not admit it, then the atonement giver should seek the advice of other *geetarth* *bhikshus* of the *gachchha*.

---------------------------
[Second Objective] [297 can declare his penance and can also separate him from the Gachchha if he refuses the penance. The statement of giving the same penance to the one who makes false accusations is in the Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 6 and the statement of separating the one who does not accept the penance given by the Geetaarth or the Acharya from the Gachchha is in the Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 4. The implication is that the Gachchha leader should not make a decision and behave based on the statement of only one party, but should listen to the statements of both parties and make a proper decision and give penance. In a doubtful situation, i.e., if the decision is not made properly, the guilty person should not be given penance. In doing so, the penancer does not incur any guilt, but the guilty person himself receives the fruit of his violation of restraint. If the consumption of the fault is proved by evidence and a clear decision is made, then it becomes mandatory to give penance even if the guilty person refuses, otherwise there will be disorder in the Gachchha and there will also be public criticism. Therefore, the Geetaarth monks and the Gachchha leaders should decide to give the penance as prescribed in the Sutras with discretion. /  The intention to abandon restraint and return 24. If a monk leaves the Gachchha due to the intention to abandon restraint and later comes back without consuming unrestraint and wants to rejoin his Gachchha, then (regarding taking him into the Gachchha) if there is a dispute among the elders (they start saying to each other) do you know if he is a pratisevi or an apratisevi? (In such a situation, the Agama's provision is that the elders should) ask the monk himself - are you a pratisevi or an apratisevi? If he says - "I am a pratisevi." then he is eligible for penance. If he says - "I am not a pratisevi." then he is not eligible for penance. /  Whatever evidence he gives, the evidence should be taken. /  50 - What do you say, Bhante? A - True conduct. 24.

---------------------------
[298] The *Vyavahar Sutra* states, "I am not a *pratisevi*." Then he is not subject to *prayaschitta* and the decision should be made based on the evidence he provides. Q: O Bhagavan! What is the reason for saying this? A: The *vyavahar* (atonement) depends on the truthful statement of the monks who have taken the vow of truth. The discussion in the 32nd Sutra of the First Uddeshak states that a monk who has abandoned *samyama* and become a householder can be re-initiated into the *gana* after returning. This Sutra states that a monk who has abandoned *samyama* and gone elsewhere due to a change of mind can return. This fickle-minded monk can return on the same day, after one or two nights, or even after many days. When the returning monk wants to stay in the *gachchha*, he should explain his change of mind and its reasons. At that time, if the *geetarth* elders of the *gachchha* do not agree, i.e., if someone doubts that he may have indulged in some fault during this period, the *gachchha* leader should question the monk or inquire from someone else and make a decision. If no authentic information is available, the decision should be made according to the monk's answer. If he admits to indulging in the fault, he should be given *prayaschitta* for it. If he does not admit to the fault, he should not be given *prayaschitta* simply because someone doubts him. However, he can be given appropriate *prayaschitta* for the intention to abandon *samyama* and for going elsewhere due to that intention, and he can be included in the *gachchha*. The description of not having the intention to abandon *samyama*, the description of the reasons for abandoning *samyama*, and the description of the examination upon returning to the *gana* can be found in the discussion of the 32nd Sutra of the First Uddeshak. Here, the commentator has mentioned some specific reasons for the intention to abandon *samyama*, which are related to the previous Sutra 23, and has also mentioned some reasons for the change of mind. Reasons for abandoning *samyama*: 1. A person who has been falsely accused may become disheartened and decide to abandon *samyama*. 2. A person who speaks the truth may not be able to prove his statement, and he may become distressed by injustice and decide to abandon *samyama*. 3. A monk who has indulged in a fault may want to hide it, but if it is revealed and proven by someone else, he may feel ashamed and decide to abandon *samyama*. 4. If the *geetarth* elders make a wrong decision due to someone's deception, a person may become dissatisfied and decide to abandon *samyama*.

---------------------------
## Second Objective [299 Reasons for Returning to the Order]

1. Persuasion by the monks sent with him.
2. Persuasion by a prominent person from the community.
3. Persuasion by family members.
4. Through contemplation, meditation, or recollection of the renunciatory Agamasutras.
5. Due to the subsidence of passions and conflicts.
6. Upon learning of the death of his wife, if he was attached to her.
7. Upon learning of the complete destruction of his wealth.
8. Upon learning that his family will not keep him at home.
9. If he had abandoned his vows due to lack of faith in Dharma, and then regained faith upon witnessing something.
10. If he becomes severely ill on the way, or faces hardship or adversity, and realizes that abandoning his vows will lead to the destruction of his merit and the rise of demerit, and therefore decides that it is better to uphold his vows.
11. Due to the advice of a friend or a deity.

The commentator has also clarified that if a monk intends to abandon his vows, he should inform the head of the order. The head of the order should then try to stabilize him through various means. If the monk still wishes to leave, 1-2 skilled monks should be sent with him to accompany him for 1-2 nights or until he reaches his destination. They should advise him appropriately along the way and finally reach his destination. If, during this time, his thoughts become stable again, he should be brought back and entrusted to the head of the order. Even if he does not return, the monks who accompanied him should inform the head of the order about the events that transpired during the journey. If the monk changes his mind after the accompanying monks have returned, and he returns alone, then the situation described in the sutra may arise. A monk who intends to abandon his vows may leave after informing the order or without informing them. Both types of monks may return without abandoning their vows or may return after abandoning them. This sutra deals with the situation of a monk who returns without abandoning his vows.

**The provision for granting a position to a unilateral monk:**

25. A unilateral monk, i.e., a monk who has received initiation and studied scriptures from only one teacher, may be granted a position in the order, whether he has been ordained formally or informally, whether he has been accepted or not, as long as he is worthy of the order. 

Page #120:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[300]** It is appropriate to establish or hold the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for a short period or for life, or it can be done in circumstances where it is in the best interest of the Gan.  

**Discussion:** To ensure the smooth functioning of the Sangha in the Acharya's or Upadhyaya's presence, a suitable Acharya and Upadhyaya should be appointed. 

**Reasons for short-term appointment:**

1. The current Acharya needs to be relieved of the Sangha's responsibilities for treatment of a specific illness or for performing specific tapasya for overcoming attachment.
2. The Acharya needs to go to another Acharya or Upadhyaya for study or to teach and assist them.
3. The Acharya needs to temporarily abandon their vows due to circumstances.
4. The necessary studies of a qualified monk are incomplete at the time of appointment.

**Reasons for life-long appointment:**

1. The Acharya or Upadhyaya knows their death is approaching.
2. The Acharya or Upadhyaya is very old or has a long-term incurable illness.
3. The Acharya or Upadhyaya needs to perform specific practices like studying the Jina Kalpa.
4. The Acharya needs to completely abandon their vows.
5. The Acharya is unable to follow Brahmacharya.
6. The Acharya needs to leave their own Gachchha and join another.

In these situations, a qualified monk is appointed to the position of Acharya for life.

**The commentator mentions two types of Acharyas:**

1. **Sapeksha (Relative):** An Acharya who appoints a qualified monk to their position at the appropriate time during their lifetime.
2. **Nirapeksha (Absolute):** An Acharya who does not appoint a qualified monk at the appropriate time, neglecting their duty and passing away, or appointing an unqualified person.

This is because after their death, the Gachchha experiences an increase in kshaya (negative emotions), conflict, etc., leading to the disruption of the Gachchha's order.

**The Sutra uses the term "Ekpakshi" (one-sided). The commentary explains it as:**

"Duviho ya egpakshi, pavajja sue ya hoi nayancho / Suttammi egvayana, pavajjaaye kulivaadi."

**Meaning:**

"Ekpakshi is of two types: 1. From Shruta (scripture) and 2. From Pravrajya (renunciation)." 

Page #121:
---------------------------
The second objective, 301, states that a monk who has received teachings from a single guru, or whose knowledge of scriptures and their meaning is similar to that of the Acharya and other teachers, without any difference, is called **ekapakshika** from the perspective of **shruta** (scriptural knowledge). A monk who has been ordained in a single **kula** (lineage), **gana** (group), and **sangha** (community) and has remained stable, or who has resided and studied with a single **gachcha** (lineage) of monks, is called **ekapakshika** from the perspective of **pravrajya** (ordination).

The commentator has explained these two terms by dividing them into four categories:

1. **Ekapakshika** from both **pravrajya** and **shruta**.
2. **Ekapakshika** from **pravrajya** but not from **shruta**.
3. **Ekapakshika** from **shruta** but not from **pravrajya**.
4. Not **ekapakshika** from either **pravrajya** or **shruta**.

Only a monk belonging to the first category should be appointed to a position. The other categories are not fully **ekapakshika**. The last sentence of the sutra also mentions an exception, stating that if there is no fully **ekapakshika** and eligible monk in a particular situation, the **gana-pramukhas** (leaders of the group) can decide what is appropriate for the **gana**.

The commentator clarifies that even in exceptional circumstances, a monk belonging to the third category, who is fully **ekapakshika** from **shruta**, should be appointed to a position. However, appointing a monk belonging to the second or fourth category would result in the Acharya incurring the **guru-chaumasi** (a type of penance) and facing the consequences of **prajna-bhang** (loss of wisdom) and other faults. Therefore, a monk who is not **alpasruta** (having limited knowledge) but **bahushruta** (having extensive knowledge) and **ekapakshika** from **shruta** can be appointed to a position in such situations.

The commentator has also stated in **ga. 333** that a monk who is **alpasruta** is not **ekapakshika** but **anekapakshika** (having multiple perspectives).

The disadvantages of not being **ekapakshika** from **shruta** are:

1. Due to different interpretations, the monk cannot satisfy the students on various topics.
2. Different interpretations can lead to disputes within the **gachcha**.
3. Different interpretations can lead to conflicts and fragmentation of the **gachcha**.
4. If the monk has limited knowledge, they cannot resolve questions and answers, forcing students to seek answers from other **gachchas**.
5. Monks from other **gachchas** can attract students with **agit-artha** (meaning not found in the scriptures) or **git-artha** (meaning found in the scriptures) by using **shruta** as a means, leading to harm, unrest, and disorder in the **gana**.

The disadvantages of not being **ekapakshika** from **pravrajya** are:

1. An Acharya who has been ordained in a different **kula** and **gana** may not consider the monks of the **gana** as their own. 

Page #122:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**302]** [Vyavahar Sutra 2. Many sadhus in a gana do not accept an acharya who is not their own. 3. Due to the lack of complete intimacy between them, there is no increase in love or discipline, but rather neglect and indiscipline. 4. Due to the lack of mutual intimacy, selfishness and greed for disciples lead to conflicts, which harm the Jain religion. 5. The commentator has also stated that even after a long time, the feeling of estrangement does not disappear, which leads to divisions in the gachchha. Therefore, the first bhangavarti, a one-sided bhikṣu, should be established in the position of acharya etc. for a short period or for life. 

While explaining the exceptional provisions in the sutra, the commentator has first stated that the third bhang, i.e., the one-sided bhikṣu from the Shruta, should be appointed to the position. In the absence of a qualified sadhu of the first or third bhang, if it becomes necessary to give someone the position of acharya etc., then the second or fourth bhang can be given the position in order. Because in a gana where there is a community of many sadhus and sadhvis, and where there are newly ordained, young, or child-like sadhus and sadhvis, it is completely forbidden for them to be without an acharya, upadhyaya, or pravarti. There it is also stated that Shraman Nirgranth remain under the supervision of two degree holders, and Shramani Nirgranthis remain under the leadership of three degree holders. If, due to circumstances, a multi-sided bhikṣu of any bhang is given the position of acharya etc., then he should possess these qualities: 1. He should be naturally gentle. 2. All the sadhus and sadhvis of the gachchha should agree to him being their acharya. 3. He should be virtuous and well-versed in the Vinaya. ... 4. The acharya sadhu etc. should be related to his family from his householder life, or many sadhus and sadhvis should be related to his householder life. 5. He should have established intimacy in the gana through his conduct. 

If he possesses many such qualities, then that multi-sided bhikṣu can also be appointed to the position of acharya etc. In a gana where there are many geetarth bhikṣus who are accomplished in discipleship etc., one should be appointed as the main acharya and another with similar qualities should be appointed as the upadhyaya. After that, the one who is full of disciples and possesses the qualities of an acharya should also be appointed to the positions of acharya or upadhyaya etc., and if he does not possess those qualities, he should be adorned with the position of sthavir etc. But those who do not have many disciples should remain under the discipline of one main acharya.

A *Pariharika* monk should not accept food, drink, or anything else from an *Apariharika*. If the *Thera* says to him, "Come on, *Prajjo*, you should take this from him or accept it from him," then he should accept food or anything else from him.

He should accept it himself, or he should accept it from his own *Paddagha*, or he should accept it from his own *Palasa*, or he should accept it from his own *Kamandalu*, or he should accept it from his own *Khubbagha*, or he should accept it from his own *Panisi*, and he should eat or drink it himself. This is the rule for an *Apariharika* monk. 29. A *Pariharika* monk should go to the *Thera*’s place for food, and the *Thera* should say to him, "Come on, *Ajjo*, you will eat or drink with us later." Then he should accept it.

---------------------------
[304] If a monk is in the Parihara Kalpa, he should not accept food or drink from anyone, whether it is offered directly or indirectly, through a bowl, a vessel, a pitcher, a hand, or any other means. This rule is considered to be non-negotiable. 26. If many monks, both Pariharika and Apariharika, wish to stay together for one, two, three, four, five, or six months, then the Pariharika monks can eat together with other Pariharika monks, and the Apariharika monks can eat together with other Apariharika monks. However, Pariharika monks cannot eat with Apariharika monks. All monks (Pariharika and Apariharika) can eat together after six months of Tapas and one month of Parana. 27. It is not permissible for an Apariharika monk to offer food or drink to a Pariharika monk, even if it is delicious or offered with an invitation. However, if a Sthavira (senior monk) says, "O Arya! You should offer this food to these Pariharika monks, or invite them to eat," then it is permissible to offer food or invite them to eat. If a monk in the Parihara Kalpa wishes to consume ghee or other similar substances, he should seek permission from the Sthavira. He should say, "O Bhagavan! Please grant me permission to consume ghee or other similar substances." After receiving permission from the Sthavira, he can consume ghee or other similar substances. 28. A monk in the Parihara Kalpa should take his own bowl and go to collect food for himself. If, upon seeing him, the Sthavira says, "O Arya! Please bring me some food and water as well, I will also eat and drink," then it is permissible for him to bring food for the Sthavira. However, it is not permissible for an Apariharika Sthavira to eat or drink from the bowl of a Pariharika monk. He can eat or drink from his own bowl, a Palasaka (measuring vessel), a water vessel, or by holding the food or drink in both hands or one hand. This is considered to be the proper conduct for an Apariharika monk in relation to a Pariharika monk. 29. If a monk in the Parihara Kalpa takes the bowls of the Sthavira and goes to collect food and water for them, and the Sthavira says, "O Arya! Please bring some for yourself as well, and eat and drink later," then it is permissible for him to bring food and water for himself in the bowls of the Sthavira.

## Second Objective [305]

A Pariharic Bhikshu is not allowed to eat or drink from the bowl of an Apariharic Sthavir. However, he is allowed to eat or drink from his own bowl, from a Palasak, from a Kamandalu, or by holding the food in both hands or in one hand. This is called the "Prachar" of a Pariharic Bhikshu in comparison to an Apariharic Bhikshu.

**Discussion:**

When Apariharic Bhikshus live with Bhikshus who are performing Pariharatapas, some of them eat separately and some eat together. A Bhikshu who performs a one-month Pariharatapas eats separately until the completion of the one-month tapas and for five days after the Parana. After that, he eats a Mandalik Aahar. Similarly, a Bhikshu who performs a two-month Pariharatapas eats separately for two months and ten days, a three-month tapas Bhikshu for three months and fifteen days, a four-month tapas Bhikshu for four months and twenty days, a five-month tapas Bhikshu for five months and twenty-five days, and a six-month tapas Bhikshu for six months and thirty days (one month). In this way, after one month from the completion of the Pariharatapas, all Pariharic and Apariharic Bhikshus eat together.

A Bhikshu performing Pariharatapas brings his own food and is not allowed to take food from anyone. This is the general rule. If he becomes weak while performing tapas, the Sthavir should tell the other Bhikshus, "O Aryas! You should give food to this Parihari Bhikshu or invite him." Upon being told this, he can be given food. If he needs ghee or other Vigaya, he can consume it after receiving permission again. However, he cannot consume Vigaya just by being given permission to eat food.

**General Rule:**

A Pariharic Bhikshu who lives in a Vyayavritta with an Apariharic Sthavir goes separately to get food for himself and for the Sthavir. This is the general rule. However, if the Sthavir gives permission for any reason, he can bring food for the Sthavir along with his own food in their respective bowls. He can also bring his own food in the Sthavir's bowl along with the Sthavir's food. If any Vigaya gets mixed with his rough food while doing so, he can eat it with the Sthavir's permission.

**Sutras:**

The Sutras state that these Bhikshus should not eat from each other's bowls. They should eat from their own bowls or by holding the food in their hands. This rule implies that they should keep their bowls separate and cannot eat the food brought together collectively. The reason for this is that... 

Page #126:
---------------------------
The *Vyavaharsutra* states that a *Pariharic* monk is one who adheres to the rules of conduct. Bringing food along due to circumstances or by order is an exception, but it is necessary to follow the general rule of not having any obstacle in taking the bowl and eating together. The monk's body is an aid to restraint and austerity, therefore, it is necessary to provide him with food, etc. Even an act done for one's own body without attachment is a cause of *nirjara*, therefore, the *sutra* uses the word "Appano Veyavadaiae", meaning "for one's own *veyavrutya*". The *sutra* uses these words for the means of eating food: 1. In one's own (food-taking) bowl. 2. In one's own "palasak" (measure). 3. In one's own *kamandalaka* (water-taking vessel). 4. In one's own *khobe*, meaning in the cupped hands. 5. In one's own hand, meaning in the palm of one hand. Here, the commentator has interpreted "one's own *palasak*" as "a dona made of *dhaka* leaves". The word "sayansi" is used with each word in the *sutra*. The monk's own bowl is the one that is always with him and which is *pragamoct*. It is forbidden in the *agama* to keep a dona made of *palasa* leaves, and it is not suitable for long-term use. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand "one's own *palasak*" as "measure", and keeping a measure is also *agamasammat*. - *Dasha. Da. 8 Sutra* reveals that if the monks are *unodari* of the bowl, they can eat by taking it in their own measure, hand, or *khobe* (cupped hands). In this *Vyavaharsutra* composed by Shri Bhadrabahu Swami of the *Chaudaspurva*, three names have been mentioned from the perspective of the bowl. This implies that a monk can generally keep many bowls, therefore, the historical statement of keeping only one bowl cannot be considered *agamasammat*. Considering the abundance of statements regarding *parihara* austerity and *pariharik* monks in the *Chhedasutras*, it does not seem appropriate to consider this method as discontinued. The main *agamasammat* rules of this method are: "To live with the *acharya* etc. in silence with *ayambil*, fasting, and solitude, to renounce assistance and sexual pleasure, etc.", which are possible to follow in the present time. The interpretations have considered it discontinued and have also stated it as forbidden for nuns, but there is no mention of this in the *agamas* nor is it proven by any *agama* rule.

## Second Uddeshak (Objective)

**Summary:** The carrying of Pariharatapas (penance) by two or more wandering monks can be done. Sick monks should not be neglected or expelled from the Gachchha (community), but should be properly served. A monk who has received the ninth or tenth Prayaschitta (atonement) should be given Upasthapana (ordination) only after wearing the Grihastha-linga (householder's mark). However, it may be possible to give Diksha (initiation) without the Grihastha-linga, depending on the decision of the Gachchha-pramukh (head of the community). In cases of accusation and dispute, Prayaschitta should be given only after clear proof. If there is no proof, Prayaschitta should be given only after accepting one's own fault. A monk whose Shruta (scriptural knowledge) and Diksha (initiation) are one-sided should be given the position of Acharya (teacher). Even after the completion of Pariharatapas, the food should be taken separately for some days. For a period of up to one month, the food should be taken separately so that he can consume food without Samvibhaga (equal distribution). Pariharatapas can be given only with the knowledge of the Sthavir (elder monk), and he can consume Vigaya (special food) only after obtaining special permission. A Pariharic (penitent) monk who is serving the Sthavir can bring both their Gochari (food) together, but should not eat together. He should eat separately, using his own hand or bowl.

**Conclusion:** This Uddeshak discusses the rules regarding the carrying of Pariharatapas, serving sick monks without neglecting them, the Upasthapana of those who have received the ninth or tenth Prayaschitta, the decision-making process in case of disputes, the appointment of a one-sided Acharya, and other related topics.

**End of the Second Uddeshak**

---------------------------
## Third Uddeshak

1. If a Bhikkhu desires to hold a Gan (group) i.e. to be a leader, and he is devoid of Sutra-knowledge and other qualifications, then it is not permissible for him to hold a Gan. If the Bhikkhu is endowed with Sutra-knowledge and other qualifications, then it is permissible for him to hold a Gan.

2. If a qualified Bhikkhu desires to hold a Gan, then it is not permissible for him to hold a Gan without seeking permission from the Theras (elders). If the Theras grant permission, then it is permissible to hold a Gan. If the Theras do not grant permission, then it is not permissible to hold a Gan.

If someone holds a Gan without seeking permission from the Theras, then due to this violation of the code of conduct, he becomes liable for Diksha-Chhed (excommunication) or Tap-Prayaschitt (penance). However, those Sarmic Sadhus (devout monks) who live under his leadership are not liable for Diksha-Chhed or Tap-Prayaschitt.

**Explanation:**

Holding a Gan happens in two ways:

1. Leading a group of Sadhus or observing Chaturmas (four-month rainy season retreat) with them. This is the first type of holding a Gan. Such a Bhikkhu is called a Gan-dhar, Gan-pramukh, Sanghatak-pramukh, Mukhiya, or leader. In the commentary, he is also called "Spardhak-pati".

2. Being the head of a group of Sadhus, i.e., holding the position of Acharya (teacher) etc. This is called Acharya, Upadhyaya, Gan-dhar, Gachch-adhipati, Gani, etc.

The meaning is that those who hold a position and those who lead are called "Gan-dhar". The two Sutras presented here refer to the first type of Gan-dhar, because they mention seeking permission from the Theras to hold a Gan and the liability for penance for holding a Gan without permission. This rule is not applicable to those who hold the position of Acharya. The position of Acharya is given by the Theras of the Gan or by the permission of the current Acharya, or by the Sadhus, Sadhvis, and the four-fold Sangha of the Gachch. However, no one can take the position on their own. 

Page #129:
---------------------------
[The Third Uddeshak] [309 The idea that someone could take on the role of a Pracharaya without asking the sthavira or even without asking at all is completely incongruous. Therefore, the subject of these two sutras is the conduct of the Sanghataka in the role of a leader. The discussion of the expectations of the Acharya and other positions is addressed in later sutras. If a monk wishes to conduct themselves as the head of the monastic community, they must be palichhanna. This means they must possess both the qualities of a disciple (shiष्यसम्पदा) and the knowledge of the scriptures (श्रतसम्पदा). The commentator has described four categories of these qualities, and according to the first category, only someone who possesses both qualities should conduct themselves as a leader. If there is no tradition of having separate disciples, then a monk who is knowledgeable in the scriptures (ग्रागमवेत्ता) and wise can lead a group of monks. A monk who has one or more disciples is considered to have the quality of a disciple (शिष्यसम्पदा). A monk who has memorized the essential sutras, the Dashavaikalika Sutra, the Uttaradhyayanasutra, the Acharangasutra, and the Nishitthasutra, along with their meanings, and has also memorized the meanings of these sutras from a Pracharaya or Upadhyaya, and who can still recall these scriptures, is considered to be knowledgeable in the scriptures (श्रुतसम्पन्न). A monk who has no disciples and has not studied the aforementioned scriptures is unfit to lead a monastic community. Similarly, a monk who has disciples but is not wise or knowledgeable in the scriptures, or has forgotten the scriptures they have memorized, is also unfit to lead a monastic community. However, if a monk has forgotten the scriptures due to old age (over 60 years), they are still considered knowledgeable in the scriptures (श्रुतसम्पन्न) and can lead a monastic community. The phrase "भगवं च से" is used in this sutra. The presence of "च" and "से" with the word "भगवं" indicates that this is not a form of address. Therefore, this phrase is used for the Anugara who desires to lead a monastic community. The words "पलिच्छन्ने" and "अपलिच्छन्ने" are added to this phrase to establish two types of qualifications. Therefore, the meaning of "भगवं च से" is "if that monk (Anugara Bhagavant)" and the meaning of "पलिच्छन्ने" is "possessing the qualities of a disciple and knowledge of the scriptures." The commentator has referred to someone with the quality of a disciple as "द्रव्यपलिच्छन्न" and someone with knowledge of the scriptures as "भावपलिच्छन्न." Based on this four-fold analysis, only someone who is "भावपलिच्छन्न" is considered fit to lead a monastic community. In essence, someone who is knowledgeable in the essential scriptures and wise can lead a monastic community. The commentator has also clarified that: 1. While leading, they should be capable of purifying their own knowledge, vision, and conduct, as well as that of other monks. 2. They should be able to bring ordinary people closer to Dharma through their knowledge, speech, and behavior. 

Page #130:
---------------------------
[310] A monk who is capable of giving appropriate answers to any person who comes to discuss matters from another perspective, can wander as the head of the group, i.e., as the head of the Sanghataka. These qualities of speech are essential for the head monk who wanders with the aim of spreading Dharma, but for the monk who wanders with the aim of general welfare, it is sufficient to be a Shruta-sampanna as described in the sutras, with the exception of Abhigraha images, silent meditation, etc. Even if he does not possess the qualities of speech, he can still wander as the head and practice self-restraint. According to the second sutra, no Shruta-sampanna monk can wander as the head of the group at will, but can only take charge of the group with the permission of the senior monk of the Gachchha. He should ask the senior monk, "O Bhagavan! I wish to wander with some monks." Then, the senior monk, knowing his qualifications and seeing the appropriate opportunity, can grant permission for him to take charge of the group. If, for any reason, the senior monk does not grant permission, he should not take charge of the group and should wait for the appropriate opportunity.

In the context of the provision in the sutra for obtaining permission from the senior monk, it should be understood that the word "senior" refers to all those who have the authority to give orders, including the Acharya, Upadhyaya, Pravartaka, etc. The word "senior" is very broad and includes all monks who hold a position and are in charge. In the Bagams, the word "There Stavir" is used for the Ganadhara Gautam Sudharmaswami and also for the Tirthankaras. Therefore, the meaning of this provision is that it is necessary to obtain the permission of any senior monk of the Gachchha to take charge of the group, and it is also necessary to be proficient in Shruta-sampada, etc. If a monk, due to intense desire, wanders with his disciples or other monks who are under his care for study, etc., without obtaining permission or approval, he is liable for atonement. The disciples who are with him or the monks who are under his care for any reason, such as study, etc., are not liable for atonement as they are following his orders. This is also clarified in the second sutra.

The sutra, while providing for atonement for a monk who takes charge of the group without permission, states, "Se Santara Chheye Va Parihare Va." The commentator, explaining the meaning of this, clarifies that the monk, due to his offense, receives the appropriate atonement of Chhed (five days, etc.) or the atonement of monthly or other Pariharatapas or general tapas. This atonement is given to him, according to the sutra, for the sake of discipline, whether he is criticized or not. This provision is made in the sutra for the monk. Similarly, the entire provision should be understood for the Sadhvi. She should also obtain permission from the senior monk or Pravartiini to wander.

## Third Uddeshak [311 Upadhyaya Adi Pad Dene Ke Vidhi-Nishedh]

**3.** A Shraman Niggranth with a three-year Dikshaparaya, who is skilled in Acharakushal, Sanjamakushal, Pravachanakushal, Prajnaptikushal, Sangrahkushal, and Uvaggahkushal, and possesses Akshat Charitra, Abhinna Charitra, Asabal Charitra, and Asanklishta Achar, is Bahushrut and Bahuagmagnya, and adheres to the minimum Achar-Prakalp, is eligible for the Upadhyaya Pad.

**4.** The same Shraman Niggranth with a three-year Dikshaparaya, who is not skilled in Achar, Sanjam, Pravachan, Prajnapti, Sangrah, and Uvaggah, and possesses Kshat, Bhinna, Shabal, and Sanklishta Achar, is Alpashrut and Alpaagmagnya, is not eligible for the Upadhyaya Pad. 

Page #132:
---------------------------
##  [312] [Vyavahar Sutra 5. A Shraman Nirgranth with a five-year dikshaparaya - if he is skilled in conduct, restraint, preaching, knowledge, collection and support, and has an unblemished character, an undivided character, a strong character and an unmixed conduct, is well-versed in scriptures and has knowledge of many scriptures, and has at least mastered the Dasha Shruta Skandha, Brihat Kalpa and Vyavahar Sutra, then it is appropriate to give him the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya. / 6. The same Shraman Nirgranth with a five-year dikshaparaya - if he is not skilled in conduct, restraint, preaching, knowledge, collection and support, and has a blemished character, a divided character, a weak character and a mixed conduct, is less-versed in scriptures and has knowledge of few scriptures, then it is not appropriate to give him the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya. 7. A Shraman Nirgranth with an eight-year dikshaparaya - if he is skilled in conduct, restraint, preaching, knowledge, collection and support, and has an unblemished character, an undivided character, a strong character and an unmixed conduct, is well-versed in scriptures and has knowledge of many scriptures, and has at least mastered the  Sthananga-Samavayanga Sutra, then it is appropriate to give him the position of Acharya, Upadhyaya and Ganavcchedak. 8. The same Shraman Nirgranth with an eight-year dikshaparaya - if he is not skilled in conduct, restraint, preaching, knowledge, collection and support, and has a blemished character, a divided character, a weak character and a mixed conduct, is less-versed in scriptures and has knowledge of few scriptures, then it is not appropriate to give him the position of Acharya, Upadhyaya and Ganavcchedak. Discussion - In a Gachchha where there are many Sadhus and Sadhvis, where many Sanghatakas (Sanghade) wander separately, or where there are newly initiated, young or adolescent Sadhus and Sadhvis, it is absolutely necessary to have many holders of positions, and it is absolutely essential to have at least two holders of positions, Acharya and Upadhyaya. But in a Gachchha where there are only 2-4 Sadhus or 2-4 Sadhvis, where only one or two Sanghatakas wander separately, and where there are no newly initiated, young or adolescent Sadhus and Sadhvis, then their management can be done by the elders based on their age or dikshaparaya without any holder of positions. Here, in the first two sutras, the eligibility for the position of Upadhyaya, in the second two sutras, the eligibility for the position of Acharya and Upadhyaya, and in the third two sutras, the eligibility for other positions has been stated based on dikshaparaya, study of scriptures and various qualities. In which, the minimum limit of dikshaparaya and study of scriptures has been stated to be higher for Acharya than Upadhyaya, and higher for Ganavcchedak than them. / Apart from this, these positions can also be given to anyone with a medium or excellent dikshaparaya and study of scriptures. The qualities of being skilled in conduct, etc., have been stated to be the same for all holders of positions. / Therefore, these qualities are essential in every monk who is eligible for a position. Dikshaparaya - The Bhashyakar has stated that according to dikshaparaya, experience, ability and competence develop, which enables the monk to fulfill the responsibilities of those positions. 

Page #133:
---------------------------
## Third Objective:

[313] The primary responsibility of the Upadhyaya is to impart education, which includes overseeing all aspects of the disciples' studies. Therefore, it is considered essential for this position to have a minimum of three years of *dokshaparyaya*. 

The Acharya is responsible for the entire management of the *gachchha*. They also deliver discourses on *artha* and *paramartha*. Therefore, considering their greater experience and capabilities, a minimum of five years of *dokshaparyaya* is considered necessary for them.

The *ganavachchedak* fulfills numerous duties related to the *gan* and relieves the Acharya of their concerns. The *ganavachchedak* is responsible for the service, movement, and atonement arrangements for the *gachchha* monks. 

Although the Acharya is fully responsible for discipline, the *ganavachchedak* has a greater responsibility for management and operations. Therefore, it is considered essential for them to have a minimum of one year of *dokshaparyaya*.

## Other Qualities:

These sutras mention ten qualities, including *prachar-kushlata*. Their explanation in the *bhashya* is as follows:

1. **Acharakushal:** One who is skilled in both *jnanaachar* and *vinayaachar* is called *pracharakushal*. For example, they stand up when the guru or others arrive, offer them a seat and a stool, greet them with respect in the morning, seek their blessings, remain close to them in thought or deed, inspire disciples and *praticchhakas* (those who come from other *gachchhas* to study) to respect the guru, follow the four types of *vinayapratipatti* (physical, verbal, mental, and financial) properly, act proactively, please the guru and others with appropriate worship, devotion, respect, and hospitality, avoid harsh words, have a simple and straightforward nature, maintain a stable demeanor free from distorted gestures of hands, feet, and mouth, avoid deceitful behavior with others, engage in timely transcription, *pratikraman*, and self-study, practice appropriate austerities, cultivate and purify knowledge, etc., are meditative, and always respect the guru. Such a virtuous monk is called "pracharakushal."

2. **Sanyamkushal:** (1) One who diligently practices restraint with respect to the five stationary, three partially mobile, and five mobile beings, uses inanimate objects judiciously only when necessary, carefully observes every movement, including walking and sitting, maintains indifference or neutrality towards those who indulge in unrestrained behavior, performs *pramarjan* (purification) appropriately and timely, fully adheres to the rules of the *paristhapana samiti*, and refrains from harmful thoughts, words, and actions. One who is proficient (skilled) in practicing these seventeen types of restraint is *sanyamkushal*. (2) Or, one who maintains a comfortable posture while holding or lifting objects, and in matters of *eshana* (desire), *shayya* (bed), *prasan* (seat), *upadhi* (clothing), and *aahar* (food), avoids uncomfortable postures. (3) One who controls the senses and passions, i.e., does not develop attachment or aversion towards pleasant or unpleasant objects, and prevents the arising of passions. One who completely eliminates the fetters of violence, etc., is *sanyamkushal*.

(1) The present third sutra lays down the rule for being an "Aachar Prakalp Dhari".
(2) The tenth Uddeshak lays down the rule for reciting the "Aachar Prakalp" study for the first time.

10. The **Vyavahar Sutra** (3) in the fifth **uddeshak** has a provision for **prāyaścitta** (penance) for young **sadhus** and **sadhvis** who forget the **prācārpraklap** study. Thus, the **Vyavahar Sutra** mentions **mācārpraklap** or **prācārpraklap-adhyayan** a total of sixteen times, namely - once each in **uddeshak** sutra 3, 10, 17, 21, 22, 23, twice each in 15, 16, 18, 17, 18. The **Nandi Sutra** lists the names of 71 **āgamas** in the **kālik** and **utkālik** sutras. None of them mention any sutra named **prācārpraklap** or **prācārpraklap-adhyayan**. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand and consider for which sutra this **prācārpraklap** is designated and how its name has changed due to the change in time. In this regard, the views of the **vyākhyākar** (commentators) and **pūrvaācāryas** (ancient teachers) are found as follows: (1) **Pañcavihe āyarappakappe paṇṇatte**, **taṁ jaha** - 1. **māsiē ugghaie**, 2. **māsiē aṇugdhaie**, 3. **cāumāsiē ugghaie**, 4. **cāumāsiē aṇugdhaie**, 5. **pārovana**. **Toka ācārasya prathamāṁgasya padavibhāgasamācārīlakṣaṇaprakṛṣṭakalpābhidhāyakatvāt praklapāḥ ācārpraklapāḥ niśīthādhyayanam / sa ca pañcavidhaḥ, pañcavidhaprāyaścittābhidhāyakatvāt. - **Ṭhāṇāṁga**. A. 5 (2) **Ācāraḥ prathamāṁgaḥ**, **tasya praklapāḥ adhyayanaviśeṣāḥ**, **niśītham iti aparābhidhānasya /** - **Samavāyāṁga**. 28 (3) **Aṣṭāviṁśatividhaḥ prācārpraklapāḥ niśīthādhyayanam ācārāṁgam ity arthaḥ / sa ca evaṁ (1) satyaparīṇṇā jāva (25) vimutti, (26) ugdhaie, (27) aṇugdhaie (28) prārōvaṇā tivihamo niśīhaṁ tu, iti aṭṭhāviśaviho pāyarappakappanaṁmo tti**. - **Rājendra Kośa Bhā**. 2, p. 349, "**āyarappakappa**" śabda / - **Praśnavyākaraṇa Sutra** A. 10. (4) **Ācāraḥ prācārāṁgam, praklapāḥ-niśīthādhyayanam, tasya eva pañcamaculā / ācāreṇa sahitaḥ praklapāḥ ācārpraklap, pañcaviṁśati adhyayanātmakatvāt pañcaviṁśatividhaḥ ācāraḥ, 1. ugdhatimaṁ, 2. anugdhatimaṁ 3. ārovana iti tridhā praklapōmilane aṣṭāviṁśatividhaḥ**. - **Abhi. Rā. Ko.** Bhāga 2 p. 350, '**pāyarappakappa**' śabda Here, the original text of **Samavāyāṁgasutra** and **Praśnavyākaraṇasutra** mentions twenty-eight types of **prācārpraklap**, which includes 25 studies of the entire **pācārāṁgasutra** and the **niśīthasutra**.

The third Uddeshak [317] mentions the sum of twenty-eight by including three divisions. The present Sutra mentions "Pracharprakalp" sixteen times and emphasizes its study. It seems appropriate to understand both the currently famous Sutras from it. Because if only the Pracharang Sutra is accepted, the word "Prakalp" becomes meaningless, and if only the Nishisth Sutra is understood, then studying the Nishisth Sutra without studying the Acharang would be considered inappropriate. The reason for this is that it is necessary to study the Prachar-vidhans before studying the Prayaschitt-vidhans. In the Samavayang and Prashnavyakaran Sutra, the Sutrakar has also counted twenty-eight studies by mentioning twenty-five studies related to Prachar along with the Prayaschitt form of study. At the time of the creation of the Nandistra, the twenty Uddeshak of the three divisions of Prayaschitt-vidhayak had completely separated from the Pracharang Sutra and were named "Nishisth Sutra". Due to this, no Sutra named "Prakalp" or "Acharprakalp" is mentioned in the Nandi Sutra, and in the Sutras written before the Nandi Sutra, "Pracharprakalp" is mentioned in many places, but the name "Nishisth Sutra" is not there. In the above-mentioned commentary of the Samavayang Sutra, the commentator has clarified that "Prachar means the first Ang-Yacharang Sutra and Prakalp means its special study, which is also known as the Nishisth Sutra". Thus, both the Sutras together constitute the complete Pracharprakalp Sutra. The alternative meanings of the word "Prachar-Prakalp" are as follows: 1. The Sutra that lays down the rules of Prachar and Prayaschitt, the Nishisth-Adhyayan-Yukta-Pracharang Sutra. 2. The Sutra that is the prototype of Prayaschitt for Achar-vidhans - Nishisth Sutra. 3. The study that mentions Prayaschitt related to Achar-vidhans after them - Pracharprakalp Adhyayan - Nishisth Adhyayan. 4. The Sutra or study that is a separate section or division from the Pracharang - Pracharprakalp Adhyayan - Nishisth Sutra. In the number-based Thanang and Samavayang Sutras, many forms have been made from many expectations. It is not appropriate to understand it from a single expectation. For example, the Nishisth Sutra has 20 Uddeshak, but they have been counted from different expectations (three or five). In the Thanang Sutra, three Anudghatik have also been mentioned, and five Anudghatik have also been mentioned. Similarly, five divisions of Pracharprakalp have also been mentioned, and twenty-eight divisions have also been mentioned. There are many such examples, therefore, instead of insisting on the statement of a small number, the larger number, i.e., twenty-eight, should be considered complete. In summary, the Nishisth Sutra available from a concise perspective has been called Acharprakalp in Agam and interpretations, and the Acharang and Nishisth Sutra available from a detailed and complete perspective have been called Acharprakalp together. Therefore, the conclusion is that these two are two divisions of the same Sutra.

[318] It is possible that the *Nishītha Sūtra* was separated from the *Vyavahāra Sūtra* and named *Nishītha* at the time of its composition. Prior to that, there is no evidence of the name *Nishītha* in any of the previous texts. It was only referred to as *Prācāra-prakalpa* or *Prācāra-prakalpa-adhyayana*. Due to the separation of the *Nishītha Sūtra*, there have been various opinions regarding its author, such as: 1. It was quoted from the *Pūrva* by Viśākhagaṇi. 2. Pāryaraksita composed it due to the need of the time. 3. The fourteenth *Pūrva* Bhadrabahu Svāmī quoted all four *Chheda Sūtras* from the *Pūrva*, etc. These are some of the speculations. The *Vyavahāra Sūtra* mentions *Prācāra-prakalpa-adhyayana* and states that both monks and nuns should memorize it. The *Vyavahāra Sūtra* is composed by the fourteenth *Pūrva* Bhadrabahu Svāmī. Therefore, it is clearly against the *Pūrva* to speculate that Viśākhagaṇi and Ārya Rakṣita, who came after Bhadrabahu Svāmī, composed *Prācāra-prakalpa*. If we accept that one of these two *Ācāryas* quoted from the *Pūrva*, then the *Nishītha Sūtra* would have to be considered a part of the *Pūrva*. However, the *Vyavahāra Sūtra* states that nuns should memorize it, and nuns are prohibited from studying the *Pūrva*. Therefore, the option of these two *Ācāryas* quoting from the *Pūrva* is also not true. However, it is certain that this *Prācāra-prakalpa* was available in a form different from the *Pūrva* even before these *Ācāryas*. Bhadrabahu Svāmī did not compose four *Chheda Sūtras*, but only three. This is clear from the first verse of the *Daśāśruta-skandha Sūtra* which states: "I bow to Bhadrabahu, the last of the wise, who has mastered all the good knowledge. He has separated the *Sūtra* into ten chapters, and also in the *Daśā-kṣapa-vyavahāra*." The composer of the *Daśāśruta-skandha*, the second Bhadrabahu Svāmī, has bowed to the first Bhadrabahu Svāmī, calling him the ancient Bhadrabahu, and has stated that he composed three *Sūtras*. If Bhadrabahu Svāmī had composed the *Nishītha Sūtra*, then instead of using the term *Prācāra-prakalpa* sixteen times in the *Vyavahāra Sūtra*, or mentioning it in the context of the order of study, he would have mentioned *Nishītha* somewhere. However, *Nishītha* is not mentioned in the order of study either. Only *Prācāra-prakalpa* and *Daśā-kṣapa-vyavahāra* are mentioned. Therefore, it is not evidence-based to say that Bhadrabahu composed the *Nishītha Sūtra*. All these considerations prove that it is not a composition by anyone, but rather a separation of the study of the *Ācārāṅga* for some purpose. We do not have any basis to know when and by whom it was separated, how long it was called *Prācāra-prakalpa*, and when it became *Nishītha*. However, it is certain that it was separated at the time of the composition of the *Nandisūtra*, and its name was also fixed as *Nishītha Sūtra*. The *Prācāra...

## Third Uddeshak [319]

No Sutra by the name of "Prakalpa Nama" was prevalent at that time, yet many rules under the name of "Prachar Prakalpa" are still available in the Agamas today. The first Sutra in the present Dwika lays down the rule for a Bhikshu eligible for the Upadhyaya position to study it and memorize it with its meaning. This is a necessary Jghanya Shruta for a Bhikshu eligible for the Upadhyaya position. If he does not memorize it, he is considered ineligible to be established in the Upadhyaya position.

In the second Sutra Dwika of the Dasha-Kapa-Vavahar-Dhara, while stating the eligibility and ineligibility for the Acharya position, it is said that it is necessary to memorize at least three Chhed Sutras after mentioning all the qualities from the five years of Diksha Paryaya and other Bahushruta. The word "Chhed Sutra" is not used in the original text, nor are they called Chhed Sutras in the Sutra list mentioned in the Nandi Sutra. The word "Chhed Sutra" is not used in other Agamas either. The word "Chhed Sutra" is found in commentaries like Bhashya, Chuni, etc. Therefore, these Sutras became known as "Chhed Sutras" during the time of the commentators after the composition of Nandi. In Nishith Sutra, U. 19, in the explanation of the instruction "Uttama Shruta", Drishti Vad or Chhed Sutras are considered "Uttama Shruta", where the Sutra states that there is a penance for teaching "Uttama Shruta" before teaching Prachar Shastra. Here, the word "Dasha" refers to Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, "Kapa" refers to Brihat Kalpa Sutra, and "Vavahar" refers to Vavahar Sutra. These three Sutras are undoubtedly composed by the first Bhadra Bahu Swami of the Chaudas Purvi (Niyundh). There is a specific style available in the Agamas, where the name of the same Sutra is given in the Sutra itself. For example, the name Nandi Sutra is given in Nandi Sutra, the name Samavayanga Sutra is given in Samavayanga Sutra. Similarly, in the present Vavahar Sutra, the instruction for studying Vavahar Sutra is given in two places: in the present Sutra 5 and in the study sequence of the tenth Uddeshak. In addition to this specific style, there may also be some historical reason behind it. The Bahushruta investigator should try to reveal some mystery by contemplating this subject.

In the third Sutra Dwika of the Thana-Samavay-Dhara, while stating the eligibility and ineligibility of a Bhikshu for the Ganavchhedak position, it is said that it is necessary to memorize at least the Thanaanga Sutra and Samavayanga Sutra after mentioning all the qualities from eight years of Diksha Paryaya and Bahushruta. Although the Ganavchhedak position is of special importance from the Acharya and Upadhyaya positions, the scope of the Ganavchhedak is vast in terms of work and Gan-Chita. Therefore, the minimum Diksha Paryaya and Jghanya Shruta have also been mentioned for them. In the Sutra, along with the Ganavchhedak, other positions have also been collected in many copies, the total number of which is also found to be 6 or 7 in some copies. In commentaries like Bhashya, etc., it is said that it is necessary to have five position holders in each large Gachchha. Otherwise, that Gachchha is considered to be of Sadhus...

---------------------------
##  Translation:

[320] The *Vyavahar Sutra* defines five *gachchas* (orders) as unfit, disorganized, and to be abandoned for staying in *samadhi*. These five orders are: (1) *Pracharya*, (2) *Upadhyaya*, (3) *Pravartaka*, (4) *Sthavira*, (5) *Ganavacchedaka*.  

The duties, rights, etc. of the holders of these four orders, except *Pravartaka*, are mentioned in many *Agamas*. For example: (1) It is forbidden for young *sant*s to stay without the guidance of *Pracharya* and *Upadhyaya*. (2) There are certain essential duties that are prescribed to be performed after consulting the *Sthavira*. (3) It is stated that acts like performing *prāyaścitta* (penance) or separating from the *gachcha* should be done according to the instructions of the *Ganavacchedaka*. 

*Bhāṣya* and other explanatory texts state that the duty of the *Pravartaka* is to guide *śramaṇa*s towards *samācārī* (right conduct). 

In addition to these five, the *Sutras* also mention the *Ganī* and *Ganadhara* positions. The *Ganadhara* is explained in the first *uddesaka* of this *uddesaka*, and the word *Ganī* is a synonym for *Pracharya*, meaning the one who holds the *gana-gachcha* is the *Ganī* or *Pracharya*.  (See *Thaṇā* 3, 8; *Uttara* 3; and *Vyavahar* 1/ *Abhidhānaratnakosa* 3, p. 823).

Alternatively, under the guidance of a prominent *Āchārya*, there are many other smaller *Āchāryas* (with a few disciples), who are called *Ganī*. 

The provisions of these two sections (7-8) are appropriate for *Ganavacchedaka* and *Sthavira*, but the eight-year *dīkṣā-paryāya* and memorization of the mentioned *śruta* may not be mandatory for *Ganī*, *Ganadhara*, and *Pravartaka*. Because their competence can be assessed after three or five years of *dīkṣā-paryāya*. 

The *Sthavira* can be included in the *Ganavacchedaka*, as *Ganavacchedaka*s are usually *Sthavira*s who have memorized the *śruta*. 

Therefore, this third *sutra* is related to the *Ganavacchedaka*. The collection of other positions at the end of the *sutra* may have been added later by someone. This is possible because the available copies contain these words in excess or deficiency and they are not contextually relevant. 

Although the three *sutra-dvayas* mention (1) *Pracharya-prakalpa*, (2) *Dasha-kappa-vyavahar*, (3) *Thaṇāṅga*, *Samvāyāṅga*, memorization and study of *jaghanya-śruta*, respectively, the provisions of the tenth *uddesaka* on the order of study and the *prāyaścitta* provisions and their explanation in the *Nīśītha* *uddesaka* 19 prove that:

(1) For *Upadhyaya*:  (1) *Śrāvaśyaka-sutra*, (2) *Dashavaikalika-sutra*, (3) *Uttara-adhyayana-sutra*, (4) *Āchārāṅga-sutra*, (5) *Nīśītha-sutra*, at least five *sutras* must be memorized.

(2) For *Pracharya*: (1) *Āvaśyaka*, (2) *Dashavaikalika*, (3) *Uttara-adhyayana*, (4) *Āchārāṅga*, (5) *Nīśītha*, (6) *Sutra-kṛtāṅga*, (7) *Daśa-śruta-skandha*, (8) *Bṛhat-kalpa*, (9) *Vyavahar-sutra*, at least nine *sutras* must be memorized.

(3) For *Ganavacchedaka*: The above nine *sutras* plus *Thaṇāṅga-sutra* and *Samvāyāṅga-sutra*, at least eleven *sutras* must be memorized. 

For specific explanations related to the study of *sutras*, see *Nīśītha* *uddesaka* 19.

[Third Objective] [321. The rule for giving the position to one with a short period of initiation] 9. If a Shraman Niggranth with a short period of initiation is ordained, he should be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya on that very day. Q - Why is that so, Bhagavan? A - There are many families of Theras who are well-disposed, steadfast, trustworthy, agreeable, joyful, approved and have a majority. From those well-disposed, steadfast, trustworthy, agreeable, joyful, approved and majority families, if a Shraman Niggranth with a short period of initiation is ordained, he should be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya on that very day. 10. If a Shraman Niggranth with a short period of initiation is ordained after the Acharya or Upadhyaya has attained Kal-Dharma (death), he should be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya. If he has some portion of the Acharya's teachings left to study and he resolves to complete it and does complete it, he should be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya. But if he does not complete it even after resolving to do so, he should not be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya. 9.

This pair of sutras mentions exceptions related to the period of initiation and the study of scriptures.

##  Translation:

[322] The **Vyavahar Sutra** method has been stated. That is, in the previous Sutras, it has been stated that a minimum of three years and five years of **dikshaparaya** are mandatory for **upaadhyaya** and **acharya** respectively. And in these Sutras, the **diksha** received on the same day, or the one with less than the mandatory years of **dikshaparaya**, or the one whose required **shruta** study is incomplete, such a monk is given the position of **acharya** or **upaadhyaya** due to circumstances. The meaning of these Sutras is that if someone has all the other qualities worthy of the position mentioned in the Sutras, then in a particular situation, the incompleteness of **shruta** holding or **dikshaparaya** can be considered negligible, because with all other qualities present, the lack of **shruta** and **dikshaparaya** can be fulfilled even after being given the position. In the ninth Sutra, while stating the giving of the position to the monk who received **diksha** on the same day, the highest level of religious devotion and nobility of his family is indicated, and at the end of the Sutra, the concluding statement is made about giving the position on the same day to the monk who received **diksha** from such a family with such qualities. In the tenth Sutra, the condition of completing the incomplete study of **shruta** is mentioned, that is, it is said that it is necessary to complete the remaining **shruta** either before or after giving the position. These Sutras have been stated keeping in mind two types of **ganasthiti** - (1) There is no one in the **gana** who is capable of handling the unanimous consent and discipline, at that time the **diksha** of a capable and talented person from a worthy family is indicated. (2) There is no one worthy of the position among the **sadhus** in the **gana** who have long **dikshaparaya** and are well-versed in **shruta**, but a monk with short **paraya** and incomplete **shruta** is worthy, in such circumstances, it is indicated to appoint him to the position. The family qualities of the newly ordained monk mentioned in the Sutras are: 1. A family influenced by **dharmabhavna** by **sthaviras** who are skilled in **tatharupa**. 2. **Pattiyani** - '**pritikarani, vainayikani kritani**' - a family with **vinaya**. 3. **Thejjani** - '**pritikarataya gachchitaayaam pramanabhutani**' - a family that is a proof in the work of the **gachch** due to their love for the **gachch**. 4. **Vesasiyani** - '**atmanam anyesham gachchvasina mayarahitani kritataya visvasasthanani**' - a family that is trustworthy and simple-natured, with no deceit towards all the **sadhus** of the **gachch**. 5. **Sammayani** - '**teshu teshu prayojneshu istani**' - a family that is desired in many tasks of the **sangha**. 6. **Sammuikrani** - '**bahuso vigrahesthu samutpannethu ganasy samuditam akarshith**' - a family that keeps the **gachch** happy by calming the troubles that arise in the **gachch**. 7. **Anamayani** - '**bahumayani**' - a family that is respected by all in the **gachch**, including children, the weak, and the elderly, and has words that are worthy of respect.

---------------------------
[Third Objective] 8. If a monk who is about to take initiation is from a family that is fully accepting (of Jainism), then he can be given the Acharya and Upadhyaya positions on the same day of his initiation. The commentary explains this sutra by saying that if a person who was forcibly taken home by his family due to attachment or selfishness, and later gets initiated again, then he can be given the position on the same day. However, this interpretation is not in line with the meaning of the sutra. Because the sutra does not mention any qualities or achievements related to his previous initiation, but rather describes the complete religious devotion of his family. It is not appropriate to imagine that such virtuous family members would forcibly abduct someone out of attachment or selfishness. Therefore, the newly initiated monk from such a virtuous family is the one who is intended by the term "niruddha-paryaya".

The commentary explains the tenth sutra by saying that a monk who has had his initiation period cut short due to committing some kind of fault in his restraint, and is therefore not eligible for the position, can be given the position. However, this interpretation of the subject of the sutra does not seem appropriate either. Because it is not right to give the position to someone whose conduct has been broken by such faults that make him eligible for the termination of initiation. The sutra also mentions the incompleteness of his Acharya-prakalpa study. This also proves that it is referring to someone who has a short initiation period from a young age. Because it would not be appropriate or progressive to give the position to a dull-witted monk who has completed a long initiation period but whose Acharya-prakalpa study is not complete, and who has received atonement for the termination of initiation. In fact, such a person is completely ineligible for all positions according to the previous sutras. There is no exception for him in the sutra.

Therefore, the word "niruddha" used in these sutras should not be interpreted as "restriction" or "termination" of previous initiation, but rather as "short initiation period" and "very short restraint period", meaning that the position should be given on the first day of initiation. The word "niruddha" has been used in the Agamas in the sense of "short" or "very short". For example: 1. Sanniruddhammi Aue - This human being with a very short lifespan, 2. Niruddhayu - Short lifespan, 3. Niruddhabhavpavache Samsarabhraman - Whose worldly wandering has become short, 4. Niruddhavas - One who has a short restraint period than the required years. Words have many meanings, some are etymological, some are idiomatic. Sometimes the idiomatic meaning is relevant, sometimes the etymological meaning is relevant, and sometimes both or many meanings are relevant depending on the context. Therefore, the meaning of the sutra and the words should be interpreted in such a way that it is in line with the meaning of the sutra and does not contradict other Agamic provisions.

---------------------------
[324] The *Vyavahar Sutra* is different from the *Sutras* and their meaning and the *Bhashya* in this regard. Although the *Bhashya* generally collects many possible meanings and indicates which meaning is primarily in line with the meaning of the *Sutras* using the word 'Suttanivato' in the *Gatha*, in some places, the explanation of a *Sutra* is completed in the *Bhashya* with only one meaning, which is not against the *Agamas*. Therefore, it was necessary to interpret the meaning differently from the *Bhashya* in the following places, such as: (1) *Nishith Sutra* U. 2, S. 1 'Padaponchan' (2) *Nishith Sutra* U. 2, S. 8 'Visuyavei' (3) *Nishith Sutra* U. 3, S. 73 'Golehaniasu' (4) *Nishith Sutra* U. 3, S. 80 'Anuggaesurie' (5-6) *Nishith Sutra* U. 19, S. 1 and 6 'Viyad' and 'Galei' (7) *Vyavahar* U. 2, S. 17 'Pratthajay' (8) *Vyavahar* U. 3, S. 1-2 'Ganadharana' (9) *Vyavahar* U. 9, S. 31 'Sodiyasala' (10) *Vyavahar* U. 10, S. 22 'Tivaspariyae' (11) *Vyavahar* U. 3, S. 10 'Palasgansi' (12-13) and in the present two *Sutras* 'Niruddhapariyae, Niruddhavaspariyae'. For detailed information on these topics, see the discussion of the indicated places.

It is forbidden for a *Nirgrantha* to remain without a *Nirgranthi* without the guidance of an *Acharya*. 11. If the *Pracharaya* and *Upadhyaya* of a newly initiated, child or young *Nirgrantha* die, it is not permissible for him to remain without a *Pracharaya* and *Upadhyaya*. He should first seek out an *Acharya* and then an *Upadhyaya*. 50. What do you say, *Bhanta*? A. A *Nirgrantha* who is in the company of two, such as: 1. *Pracharaya* and 2. *Upadhyaya*. 12. If the *Pracharaya* and *Upadhyaya* of a newly initiated, child or young *Nirgranthi* die, it is not permissible for him to remain without an *Acharya* and *Upadhyaya*. He should first seek out an *Acharya* and then an *Upadhyaya* and then a *Pavatti*. 50. What do you say, *Bhanta*? A. A *Nirgranthi* who is in the company of three, such as: 1. *Pracharaya*, 2. *Upadhyaya*, and 3. *Pavatti*. 11.

One less than seventy years, i.e., sixty-nine years, is called *madhyam* (adult). All those who are older than seventy years are called *sthavir*. - *Bhaashya* Ga. 220 and *tika*. In the *aagam*, a sixty-year-old is called *sthavir*. - *Vyav. U. 10.-Thaan* A. 3. *Bhaashya* Ga. 221 clarifies that whether the *navadishita* monk is a child or a young man, an adult or an elder, it is not permissible for him to stay or wander without the *nishra* of the *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya*. If a monk with more *diksha* *paryaaya* is less than forty years old, then it is not permissible for him to stay without the *nishra* of the *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya*. The implication is that whether the child or young man monk and the *navadishita* monk are one or many, it is necessary for them to stay under the *nishra* of the *aachaarya* and *upaadhyaaya*. / In the *gachch* where the *aachaarya* and *upaadhyaaya* have attained *kaladharma* or in the *gachch* where there is no *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya*, it is not permissible for the child-young man-*navadishita* monks to stay even for a moment without the *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya* or in a *gachch* without the *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya*. / They should first appoint their own *aachaarya* and then appoint an *upaadhyaaya*. / The *sutra* asks a question- "O Bhagavan! What is the intention of saying that one should not stay without the *aachaarya* and *upaadhyaaya*?"

##  Translation:

[326] [Vyavahar Sutra] It has been resolved that these aforementioned young ascetics (Niggrantha) who are not yet fully ordained, must always be accompanied by two leaders: 1. Acharya and 2. Upadhyaya. This means that under the guidance of the Acharya, they maintain their restraint and concentration, and under the guidance of the Upadhyaya, they study systematically according to the scriptures. 

The second Sutra states the same rule for the young, middle-aged, and senior Sadhvis (female ascetics). They too cannot live without the guidance of three: Acharya, Upadhyaya, and Pravartini. This Sutra also asks a question and answers that these aforementioned Sadhvis are always safe under the guidance of these three. 

The Sutra uses the terms "Niggranthass Nav-Dahar-Tarungass" and "Nigganthie Nav-Dahar-Tarunie," which are singular forms, not plural or collective. This indicates that this rule applies to each individual "Nav Dahar Tarun" ascetic. 

Therefore, in a Gachchha (community) where there are no Acharya and Upadhyaya, it is not permissible for the aforementioned young ascetics to reside. Similarly, if there is no Pravartini in addition to these two, it is not permissible for the aforementioned young Sadhvis to reside there. 

The implication is that every Gachchha with these ascetics must have two leaders: Acharya and Upadhyaya. If such a Gachchha establishes only one leader or appoints no leader at all, and relies solely on the guidance of the Ratnadhik (treasurer), then such a practice is against the scriptures. 

These Sutras clearly state that the presence of Acharya and Upadhyaya is essential, whether in a small or large Gachchha. This is the injunction of the Jinas. 

If a Gachchha has only 2-4 ascetics, and none of them are "Nav Dahar Tarun" (i.e., all are mature and senior), then they can wander without an Acharya or Upadhyaya. However, if there are "Nav Dahar Tarun" among them, they must reside under the guidance of the Acharya and Upadhyaya of any Gachchha. Otherwise, their conduct is against the scriptures. 

Similarly, if there are 5-10 Sadhvis who have no Acharya, Upadhyaya, or Pravartini, or if they have left the Gachchha due to some circumstance, and there are young Sadhvis among them, then they must also accept the guidance of an Acharya and Upadhyaya and appoint their own Pravartini. Otherwise, their conduct is also against the scriptures. 

These Sutras also clarify that according to the second aspiration of a monk mentioned in the Sthananga Sutra, Chapter 3, or according to any other vow taken by a monk, and according to the "Saparistithik Prashast Ekalvihar" (appropriate solitary wandering with circumstances) mentioned in Dasavaika Churnika, Chapter 2, Gatha 10; Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 32, Gatha 5; Prachchhanna Shruti, Chapter 1, Prashna 6, Uttara 2; and Suyagada Shruti, Chapter 1, Adhyaya 10, Gatha 11, even a monk who wanders alone is against the scriptures if he is "Nav Dahar" or "Tarun." 

Therefore, the aforementioned scripturally sanctioned solitary wandering can only be practiced by mature and senior monks who are not newly initiated. 

The implication is that it is not appropriate to engage in any form of solitary wandering or leaving the Gachchha before completing three years of initiation and reaching the age of forty. Such actions are against the scriptures.

---------------------------
[Third Objective] [327 A 20-year-old *diksha* eligible *paryaya sthavir* can, at the age of 29, take the *prachar* knowledge and practice solitary *sadhana*. However, he cannot practice solitary *sadhana* with *paristithik* or leave the *gachchha*. Even though such clear *sutras* and meanings are available, the following practices or traditions prevalent in society cannot be considered appropriate: (1) Running the *gachchha* only with the *prachar* position and not appointing an *upaadhyaay* position. (2) Running a large *gachchha* in a disorganized manner by insisting on not appointing any position. (3) Leaving the *gachchha* before the aforementioned age. Doing so is clearly a disregard for the aforementioned *pragam* provisions. The harms caused by this disregard are as follows: 1. The *gachchha* *sadhus* experience various defects such as disorder in *vinaya*, study, conduct, and *samyama* meditation. 2. The *sadhus* become independent and their *prachar* and thoughts differ, leading to the decline of the *gachchha* instead of its development. 3. Love and *samyama* meditation are lost among the *sadhus* and *kleshas* increase. 4. Ultimately, the *gachchha* also becomes fragmented. Therefore, it is necessary to appoint someone to both the *prachar* and *upaadhyaay* positions in every *gachchha*. If someone insists on keeping the *gachchha* without positions forever, considering the *prachar* and *upaadhyaay* positions to be ego-inducing and causing an increase in *kleshas*, and expresses their desire to be free of ego by doing so, then such a belief and action are completely inappropriate and also a disregard and disrespect of *jinaagya*. Because *jinaagya* is to appoint a *prachar* and *upaadhyaay*, and these two independent positions are also mentioned in the *namaskaaramantra*. Therefore, the aforementioned insistence reveals an ego that considers one's own understanding to be superior to the *sutra* provisions. If all those belonging to large *gachchhas* think that they can be free of ego and *kleshas* in the absence of the *prachar* and *upaadhyaay* positions, then the existence of the two positions in the *namaskaaramantra* will become meaningless. This will also render all the *aagam* provisions regarding position appointments insignificant. Therefore, instead of insisting on one's own thoughts or traditions, one should simply follow the *pragam* provisions. Summary: (1) Every newly ordained young *sadhu* should stay in a *gachchha* with two *padavīdhara*s, and every *sadhvi* should stay in a *gachchha* with three *padavīdhara*s. (2) One should not stay in a *gachchha* without these *padavīdhara*s. 

Page #148:
---------------------------
[328] (3) One should not wander independently before the age mentioned in the Sutras, even if it is a solitary journey or leaving the Gachchha. (4) If there is a special circumstance, one should wander under the protection of the Gachchha, along with other Acharya and Upadhyaya. (5) The Gachchha leaders should not leave their Gachchha vacant for two or three positions. 

**Rules regarding giving positions to those who have committed the act of Brahma-violation:**

13. If a Bhikkhu commits the act of Brahma-violation, he is not eligible for the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for three years, or until he is expelled from the Gachchha, or until he is reinstated.

14. If a Bhikkhu commits the act of Brahma-violation after being expelled from the Gachchha, he is not eligible for the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for his entire life, or until he is expelled from the Gachchha, or until he is reinstated.

15. If a Bhikkhu commits the act of Brahma-violation after being reinstated in the Gachchha, he is not eligible for the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for three years, or until he is expelled from the Gachchha, or until he is reinstated. After three years, he can be eligible for the positions of Thiya, Uvasanta, Uvaraya, Padiviraya, or Nivvagara.

16. If a Bhikkhu commits the act of Brahma-violation after being appointed as Acharya or Upadhyaya, he is not eligible for the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for his entire life, or until he is expelled from the Gachchha, or until he is reinstated.

17. If a Bhikkhu commits the act of Brahma-violation after being reinstated as Acharya or Upadhyaya, he is not eligible for the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya for three years, or until he is expelled from the Gachchha, or until he is reinstated. After three years, he can be eligible for the positions of Thiya, Uvasanta, Uvaraya, Padiviraya, or Nivvagara.

## Third Objective] [333 There can be many reasons for abandoning the vows of restraint, such as parosha or upsarga, etc. / It can also be a reason for the inability to observe the great vows like Brahmacharya, etc. If anyone abandons restraint for any reason and takes re-initiation, then he should also be understood as not being given the rank for three years or for life, as described in the previous Sutra Panchak, and the meaning of the words should also be understood in the same way. In many Agamas, abandoning restraint and accepting abandoned enjoyments has been clearly prohibited. In the first Chulika of the Dasha Vaikalika Sutra, many apaya (sorrows) that occur due to abandoning restraint have been mentioned, inspiring one to remain steadfast in restraint. That Chulika is also named "Rati Vakya", which means education-words that create interest in restraint / Therefore, by contemplating and meditating on that study, one should always keep the mind steady in restraint.

**Discussion:** These sutras lay down the *Prayaschitta* (penance) for not giving the position of *Aacharya* etc. to a *Bahushruta* *Bahuaagamjna* monk. Therefore, this *Prayaschitta* is not applicable to monks who are *Alpagyana* (less knowledgeable) and *Alpa-Shruta* (less learned), because they are not fully aware of the *Jinaagya* (Jain teachings) and the principles of *Sanyammarg* (path of self-control) in the form of *Utsarga* (liberation) and *Apavad* (exceptions). Therefore, they are unfit for positions due to their latent or immature nature, and it is also not possible for them to commit the faults mentioned in these sutras. If they happen to commit any partial fault, then their purification can be achieved through the *Tapprayaschitta* (penance) mentioned in the *Nishith Sutra*. 

Page #155:
---------------------------
[Third Objective] [335] Although all the ordained monks, including the Acharya, Upadhyaya, and others, are generally considered to be Bahushruta (well-versed in scriptures) and Bahuaagamajna (knowledgeable in many scriptures), the use of these terms for them is merely descriptive or may be due to a scribal error. For example, in the first objective, during the Palochana Sastra, these epithets are not attributed to the Acharya and Upadhyaya, but are applied to other monks. However, in many copies, there have been scribal errors regarding these epithets. The implication of these verses with epithets is that Bahushruta monks are responsible individuals for the Jain religion. Their indulgence in major transgressions leads to extreme disregard for the Jain religion, making their mistakes unforgivable. Therefore, a provision has been made to keep them permanently removed from the position of Dharma Shasana as a form of penance. Hence, Bahushruta monks, etc., who engage in the conduct mentioned in these verses, have no right to roam around as Acharya or even head of the Gan (group) for the rest of their lives. The verses use the terms "many times" and "many profound reasons." Therefore, if a monk commits the aforementioned conduct only once, the penance mentioned in the verses does not apply, and only a penance of Tapas (austerity) is given. If the monk commits these transgressions without many strong reasons, he receives the penance of Deeksha Chhed (expulsion from monastic life). In essence, this penance should be understood as applicable only when the transgressions are committed many times and for many profound reasons. The previous ten verses also contain provisions regarding penance, rules, and prohibitions related to the position of Acharya, etc., and these seven verses also describe the same. The difference is that the previous verses describe it in relation to the violation of celibacy or the abandonment of the monastic attire, while these verses describe it in relation to transgressions related to the first, second, or fifth Mahavratas (great vows). In other words, a monk who repeatedly indulges in lying, deceit, manipulation, cheating others, false accusations, etc., or who causes harm to others through tantra, mantra, etc., or who practices astrology, medicine, etc., is called a "Paapjeevi" (sinful) in the verses. Due to his polluted mind and corrupt conduct, he becomes completely unfit for any kind of prominence or position. The intention of these seven verses in establishing the penance is that whether it is one monk or many, or one ordained monk or many, if they collectively indulge in the transgressions mentioned in the verses, they all become subject to penance. For information about profound reasons, refer to the commentary. The essence of the third objective of verses 1-2 is that a wise, discerning monk who has completed three years of initiation and has memorized the Praacharaang Nishaath Sastra with its meaning can roam around as a leader. However, if he roams around without the permission of the Gachchha leader, Acharya, etc., he becomes eligible for penance in the form of Tapas or Chhed, as appropriate. 

Page #156:
---------------------------
[336] [Vyavahar Sutra Sutra 3.4 5-6 7-8] A monk who has completed at least three years of *dikshaparaya* and is virtuous, wise, discerning, well-versed in scriptures, proficient in the impact of *Jin-pravachan*, and has memorized at least the *Acharaang* and *Nishhoth Sutra* with their meanings, can be appointed to the position of *Upadhyaya*. A monk who has completed three years of *dikshaparaya* but does not possess these qualities cannot be appointed to the position of *Upadhyaya*.  

Besides the qualities required for an *Upadhyaya*, if a monk has completed five years of *dikshaparaya* and has memorized at least the *Acharaang*, *Sutrakritang*, and *Char Cheda Sutra* with their meanings, he can be appointed to the position of *Pracharaya*. They should also be well-versed in scriptures and other knowledge. A monk who has completed five years of *dikshaparaya* but does not possess these qualities cannot be appointed to the position of *Pracharaya*.

A monk who possesses the above qualities, has completed at least eight years of *dikshaparaya*, and has memorized the *Thanang-Samavayang Sutra* along with the aforementioned *Agamas*, can be appointed to the position of *Ganavchhedak*. A monk who has completed eight years of *dikshaparaya* but does not possess these qualities cannot be appointed to the position of *Ganavchhedak*.

In special circumstances, if a monk possesses other qualities and is deemed suitable, he can be appointed to the positions of *Pracharaya* or *Upadhyaya* even if he has not completed the required *dikshaparaya* or memorized the scriptures. This provision should be understood only when no other monk in the *Gachch* is suitable and it becomes absolutely necessary. This provision allows for a newly initiated monk to be appointed as *Acharya* on the same day.

Sadhus and Sadhvis who are less than 72 years old and have not completed at least three years of *dikshaparaya* are not allowed to wander or reside independently without the guidance of a *Pracharaya* or *Upadhyaya*. These Sadhus should not reside in a *Gachch* without a *Pracharaya* and *Upadhyaya*, and Sadhvis should not reside in a *Gachch* without a *Pracharaya*, *Upadhyaya*, and *Pratini*. If any of these individuals pass away, it is necessary to appoint someone else to their position.

If a monk appointed to the position of *Acharya* or any other position breaks the fourth vow, he is declared ineligible for all positions for life. If a monk breaks the fourth vow after relinquishing his position or if a regular monk breaks the fourth vow, he can be appointed to any position after three years if he becomes eligible. 9-10 11-12 13-17

**[Fourfold Purpose]**

6. During the rainy season, it is prescribed for an Acharya or an Upadhyaya to stay with two other Sadhus. 
7. During the rainy season, it is not prescribed for a Ganavacchedak to stay with two Sadhus. 
8. During the rainy season, it is prescribed for a Ganavacchedak to stay with three other Sadhus. 
9. During the Hemant and Grishma seasons, it is prescribed for many Acharyas or Upadhyayas to travel in a group, each with one Sadhu, and for many Ganavacchedaks to travel in a group, each with two Sadhus, in a village or even a capital city. 
10. During the rainy season, it is prescribed for many Acharyas or Upadhyayas to stay in a group, each with two Sadhus, and for many Ganavacchedaks to stay in a group, each with three Sadhus, in a village or even a capital city. 

**Discussion:**

These sutras lay down the rules regarding the travel and Chaturmas (four-month rainy season retreat) of Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Ganavacchedaks. There are no rules laid down here for Pravartak, Sthavir, or other holders of such positions, or for ordinary monks. 

Other Agamas do not have any such rules for them. Only for an unmanifested or immature monk is independent travel prohibited, and the negative consequences of independent travel are explained, and the rule of traveling in the presence of a Guru is laid down in Pracha. Shru. 1 A. 5 U. 4 and Suy. Shru. 1 A. 14 Ga. 3-4. 

There is no rule in the Agamas for a manifested, mature, and Gītārttha monk to stay alone, but there are rules for various types of Abhigṛha, Pratima, Jinkalpa, Sambhoga-pratyākhyāna, Sāhaya-pratyākhyāna, etc., and for staying alone for the sake of Samyamasamadhi or Chittasamadhi, as well as for the desire to travel alone in the second stage of a monk's aspirations. 

The mention of both Acharya and Upadhyaya together here and elsewhere implies that both are endowed with external and internal wealth in the Gachchha, and it is absolutely necessary for both these holders of positions to be present in every Gachchha, according to the Agamas. In other words, according to the Agamas, it is not appropriate for any Gachchha or community of Sadhus to travel without these two. 

The position of Ganavacchedak is also necessary in large Gachchhas, but it is not mandatory in every Gachchha like Acharya and Upadhyaya. Therefore, separate sutras are given here for them. 

According to the rules of these sutras, these three holders of positions cannot travel alone or observe Chaturmas alone, but it is necessary for them to have at least one or more Sadhus with them. The rules for the Sadhus who are to be kept with them are as follows: 

Acharya and Upadhyaya can travel with at least one Sadhu, i.e., in a group of two, during the Hemant and Grishma seasons, and can observe Chaturmas with two other Sadhus, i.e., in a group of three. This rule implies that they cannot travel alone and cannot observe Chaturmas with only one Sadhu, i.e., in a group of two. 

Page #160:
---------------------------
[340] The *Vyavahar Sutra* (ninth and tenth sutras) clearly states that even if there are many *pracharayas* and *upaadhyaayas* together during the *Hemant*, *Greeshma* seasons or *Chaturmas*, each *pracharaya* and *upaadhyaaya* must have the required number of *sants* in their respective *nishra* as mentioned in the sutras. This means that a *sadhu* who is under the *nishra* of one *pracharaya* or *upaadhyaaya* cannot stay with another *pracharaya* or *upaadhyaaya*. This implies that even if two or three *acharyas* or *upaadhyaayas* want to stay together without any other *sadhu*, they cannot do so. Similarly, they cannot stay together with fewer *sadhus* than the required number, as it would violate the rules mentioned in the sutras.

A *ganavachchedak* can travel with a minimum of two *sadhus* during the *Hemant* and *Greeshma* seasons, covering a total of three *thanas*. During *Chaturmas*, they can stay with three other *sadhus*, covering a total of four *thanas*. It is forbidden for a *ganavachchedak* to stay with fewer *sadhus*. Therefore, they cannot travel with two *thanas* or stay for *Chaturmas* with three *thanas*.

According to the ninth and tenth sutras, even if there are many *ganavachchedaks* together, they must still have the required number of *sants* in their respective *nishras* as mentioned above. They cannot count other *ganavachchedaks*, their accompanying *sants*, or themselves as part of their *nishra*.

If these three *padavidharas* want to travel independently, carrying images or possessions, or if they are forced to travel alone due to special circumstances, they must relinquish their positions as *pracharaya* or *upaadhyaaya* and appoint someone else to the position. *Pracharayas* and *upaadhyaayas* are esteemed *padavidharas* of the *sangh*. Their independent travel and *Chaturmas* with two *thanas* is not considered appropriate for the *sangh*.

Although the *ganavachchedak* is a working position under the leadership of the *acharya*, the number of *sadhus* accompanying them is mentioned as being greater than the *acharya*. This is because their area of work is larger. Having more *sadhus* for service, organization, and other tasks provides them with convenience.

The number of *sadhus* mentioned in the sutras should not be understood as a prohibition on having more *sadhus*. If it is convenient for *sannyam*, more *sants* can stay together. However, if staying with more *sants* leads to a loss of *sannyam*, such as a violation of *eshana samiti* or *paristhapanika samiti*, then it is better to travel with fewer *sants*.

When the leading *sadhu* passes away, the remaining *sadhus* have the following duty: 11. "If a monk who was previously staying in a particular place passes away, then the remaining monks should gather together. If there are others who are eligible to become *upasampanna*, then they should become *upasampanna*. If there are no others who are eligible to become *upasampanna*, then the remaining monks should stay in their own *k appa* according to their own *samatta*. They should travel in different directions, keeping a distance of eleven *padamas* between them. They should travel in different directions, keeping a distance of one *tana* between them."

## Fourth Uddeshak

[341] If it is not appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of traveling, then it is appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of the cause. If the cause is finished, then someone else should say, "Stay here, O Arya! for one or two nights." Then it is appropriate for him to stay for one or two nights. It is not appropriate for him to stay there for more than one or two nights. If someone stays there for more than one or two nights, then he is liable for the penance of Dikshached or Tap.

12. If a monk who has stayed for the Varshavas, is staying with someone as his leader, and that leader dies, then the remaining monks should choose a suitable monk as their leader. If there is no other suitable monk, and the monk himself has not completed the study of Nishita etc., then he should stay for one night at a time for rest on the way, and should go in the direction where other fellow-religionists are. It is not appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of traveling. It is appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of the cause. If the cause is finished, then someone else should say, "Stay here, O Arya! for one or two nights." Then it is appropriate for him to stay for one or two nights. It is not appropriate for him to stay there for more than one or two nights. If someone stays there for more than one or two nights, then he is liable for the penance of Dikshached or Tap.

11. If a monk is traveling from village to village, and he is staying with someone as his leader, and that leader dies, then the remaining monks should choose a suitable monk as their leader. If there is no other suitable monk, and the monk himself has not completed the study of Acharprakalp, then he should stay for one night at a time for rest on the way, and should go in the direction where other fellow-religionists are. It is not appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of traveling. It is appropriate for him to stay there for the sake of the cause. If the cause is finished, then someone else should say, "Stay here, O Arya! for one or two nights." Then it is appropriate for him to stay for one or two nights. It is not appropriate for him to stay there for more than one or two nights. If someone stays there for more than one or two nights, then he is liable for the penance of Dikshached or Tap. 

Page #162:
---------------------------
[342] It is not permissible for a monk to stay in a place with the intention of wandering in the path of the *Vyavahar Sutra*. If there is a reason like illness, then staying longer is permissible. After the illness is over, if someone says, "O Arya! Stay for one or two nights," then it is permissible for him to stay for one or two more nights. But it is not permissible to stay for more than one or two nights. A monk who stays for more than one or two nights is liable to *Deekshached* or *Taparoop* atonement due to violation of the rules. 

There must be a *Kalpak*, i.e., a leader of the *Sanghara*, among the monks who are wandering or observing *Chaturmas*. For this, the *Uddeshak* 3 Su. 1 has called him a *Gana Dharan* (one who holds the *Gana*), and it is said that he must be proficient in *Shruta* and *Deekshaparaya*. Therefore, only one who has completed three years of *Deekshaparaya* and has memorized the *Acharang Sutra* and *Nishita Sutra* can hold the *Gana*. The rest of the monks consider him as their leader and abide by his orders. 

Besides this leader, there may be one or more other monks in the *Sanghara* who are eligible to be *Sanghara* leaders, i.e., they may have completed more *Deekshaparaya* and have sufficient knowledge of *Shruta*. Sometimes, all the monks except the leader may be *Agitarth* or newly initiated. 

If the leader of the *Sanghara* who is wandering or observing *Chaturmas* attains *Kaladharma* (death), then the monk with the most *Ratna* (virtues) among the remaining monks should accept the leadership position. If he himself is not proficient in *Shruta*, then he should appoint another eligible monk to the leadership position. 

If there is not a single monk among the remaining monks who is eligible to be a leader, then it is not permissible for them to stay for *Chaturmas* or to wander. However, they should go to the vicinity of other eligible *Sarmic* monks in the direction where they are located. In such a situation, it becomes necessary to wander even during *Chaturmas*, and even if permission has been given to stay longer during the *Hemant* and *Greeshma* seasons, it becomes necessary to wander from there. Until they reach other *Sarmic* monks, it is not permissible for them to stay longer anywhere except for one day's rest on the way. If someone develops a physical ailment, they can stay for treatment. After the ailment is over, they can stay for another 1-2 days at the behest of the physician, etc. After recovering, staying for more than two days attracts appropriate atonement. 

The essence of the subject matter of these *Sutras* is that an eligible disciple should quickly memorize the necessary *Shruta* (like *Prachar Prakalp*, etc.) along with their meaning, because if it remains incomplete, he cannot become the leader of the *Gana* (Sanghara). And if the leader attains *Kaladharma*, then he must wander even during *Chaturmas*, and he cannot stay anywhere for even a single day with the intention of wandering or at someone's request. But if he has completed the aforementioned *Shruta*, then he can assume the leadership position mentioned in the *Sutras* at any time. He can also wander independently and observe *Chaturmas*.

## Fourth Objective [343]

Therefore, every monk and nun should consider the study of scriptures as their primary goal, following the order prescribed in the scriptures. The instruction for appointing a successor by a sick Acharya, etc., is as follows:

**13. "Arya! When I pass away, appoint such and such monk to my position."** If the monk designated by the Acharya is worthy of being appointed to that position, then he should be appointed. If he is not worthy of being appointed to that position, then he should not be appointed. If there is another monk in the Sangha who is worthy of that position, then he should be appointed. If there is no other monk in the Sangha who is worthy of that position, then the monk designated by the Acharya should be appointed to that position. After he is appointed to that position, if any Gītartha monk says, "Arya! You are unworthy of this position, therefore give up this position," (upon saying this) if he gives up that position, he is not liable for Diksha-Chheda or Tapa-rupa Prāyaścitta. If the Sārṁika monks do not ask him to give up the position of Acharya, etc., according to the Kalpa, then all those Sārṁika monks are liable for Diksha-Chheda or Tapa-rupa Prāyaścitta due to that reason.

**Discussion:** In the third objective, the qualities of a monk worthy of the position of Acharya-Upadhyaya were discussed in detail. Here, when a sick Acharya-Upadhyaya, knowing his end is near, designates a monk for the position of Acharya-Upadhyaya, the duty of the elders at that time is explained. 

Page #164:
---------------------------
[344] The [Vyavahar Sutra] instructs that the monk nominated by a sick Acharya to become the next Acharya may be qualified or unqualified. This means that their statement may be narrow-minded due to their illness or their emotional state. Therefore, the responsibility of deciding who should be given the position of Acharya or Upadhyaya rests with the remaining monks of the Gachchha after the Acharya's Kaladharma is attained. This means that if the monk nominated by the Acharya possesses all the qualifications mentioned in the third Uddeshak, then he should be appointed to the position, and no other option is necessary. If he is not qualified according to the scriptures and another monk is qualified, then the nominated monk should not be considered mandatory for the position, and the qualified monk should be appointed instead. If no one else is qualified, then the nominated monk, whether qualified or not, should be appointed to the Acharya position. If many other monks are also qualified for the position and are even more virtuous than the nominated monk, but the nominated monk is qualified, then he should be made Acharya. After appointing any qualified monk, whether nominated or not, or even a monk with limited qualifications due to circumstances, if it is observed that the Gachchha's administration is not functioning well, the monks' restraint and meditation are disturbed, the external environment is agitated, and other qualified monks have emerged in the Gachchha, then the senior monks or prominent Sadhus and Sadhvis of the Gachchha can request the Acharya to relinquish the position and appoint another qualified monk. In such a situation, if they do not want to relinquish the position or another Sadhu supports them and obstructs the process, then all of them are liable for atonement. This Sutra-based Agam-Prajna should be understood well, and actions like giving, taking, or requesting to relinquish the position should be performed with simplicity. All other Sadhus and Sadhvis should also support the prominent senior saints, but it is not appropriate to try to remove someone from the position or obtain it through deceit and cunning for the sake of proving one's own opinions. It is the duty of the previous Acharya who managed the Gachchha's responsibilities and the other prominent senior saints of the Gachchha to appoint a monk who possesses the qualities mentioned in the Agam with impartiality and a broad perspective, considering the welfare of the Gachchha and Jainism. Some monks themselves resolve to become Acharya, and they are the ones who sometimes create or cause unrest and distress. However, a monk who is engaged in the practice of liberation should remain pure like a lotus in water, immersed in the feeling of oneness, etc. Desiring any position or being eager for it is also a defilement of restraint. This desire involves the desire for external Siddhis, which falls under the sin of greed, and fulfilling that desire also involves resorting to various actions contrary to restraint, such as crooked policies, etc., which leads to the loss and contradiction of restraint. It also greatly strengthens the pride and ego. 

Page #165:
---------------------------
## Fourth Objective] Nishītha Uddesa. 17 states that one who exhibits the characteristics of a preceptor is eligible for atonement. Therefore, a virtuous monk immersed in the practice of restraint, if instructed or commanded by the preceptor or other senior monk of the Gachchha to take on the responsibility of the Gachchha, should consider his own capabilities and the opportunity and accept it. However, it is completely inappropriate to be determined to attain the position of Acharya oneself and to abandon the Gachchha if it is not obtained.  Thus, understanding all the information specified in this Sutra, the position should be conferred according to the method specified in the Sutra, and other ineligible and inappropriate paths should not be accepted.  _ This Sutra also clarifies that in the Vītarāgamārga, which follows the Syādvāda principle, there are also many-sided provisions in the conduct of Vinaya and obedience. In other words, Vinaya is not just a "command." For this reason, the right to consider the eligibility and ineligibility of a monk designated or not designated by the Acharya and to appoint him has been indicated. Even with such Āgama provisions, it is a path of all-round decline of the Gachchha and Jinaśāsana to act contrary to the Āgama due to the prejudice of tradition or to fulfill the saying "Bābāvākyam Pramāṇam" or to accept virtuous and skillful, all-jewel-like monks as heads of the Gachchha.  Therefore, having attained the Syādvāda path, one should not give prominence to tradition and decisions contrary to the Āgama, but should always give prominence to Jinājñā and Śāstrajñā. The instruction to confer the position by the Acharya, etc., who is leaving after abandoning restraint, is found in 14. Āriya-Uvajjhāe Ohayamāṇe Annayaram Vaejjā - "Ajjo! Mamasi Naṁ Pohāviyansi Samāṇasi Ayam Samukkasīyabbē / " Se Y Samukkasanaarihe Samukkasīyadhve, Se 4 No Samukkasanaarihe No Samukkasīyanve / Asthi Y Ittha Aṇṇe Keī Samukkasanaarihe Se Samukkasīyadhve / Taṁ Si Ca Naṁ Samukkiṭṭhasi Paro Vaejjā - "Dussamukkiḷaṁ Te Ajjo! Nivīkhavahi." Tassa Naṁ Nikkhivamāṇassa Natthi Keī Chhae Vā Parihāre Vā. Je Sāhammīyā Ahakappeṇam No Uḍāe Viharati / Savvesī Tesī Tappattiyam Chhae Vā Parihāre Vā. 14. If the Acharya or Upādhyāya who is leaving after abandoning restraint tells a prominent monk, "O Ārya, after I leave, you should establish such and such a monk in my position," then if the Acharya-designated monk is fit to be established in that position, he should be established. If he is not fit to be established in that position, he should not be established. If there is another monk in the Sangha who is fit for that position, he should be established. If there is no other monk in the Sangha who is fit for that position, then the Acharya-designated monk should be established in that position. After establishing him in that position, if the virtuous monk says, "O Ārya! You are unfit for this position, therefore abandon this position," (upon saying this) if... 

Page #166:
---------------------------
[346] If a *vyavaharsutra* abandons his position, he is not liable to *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance. If the *sarmic* monks do not ask him to leave the position of *acharya* etc. according to the *kalpa*, then all the *sarmic* monks are liable to *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance for that reason. 

**Discussion:** In the previous *sutra*, it was considered appropriate according to *agaman* to act with discretion if a sick or dying *acharya-upaadhyaya* had indicated to a monk to give him *acharya* etc. The same rule applies in this *sutra*. The difference is that here, the *acharya-upaadhyaya* who is willing to abandon *sanjaya* in terms of both substance and feeling is described. Due to ill health, a weakening of the feeling of *vairagya*, the strong emergence of *vedamohiya*, or other *parishah* afflictions, the intention to abandon *sanjaya* may arise. If this is not prevented, such a situation may arise for ordinary monks or those who have received degrees. The description of this situation and its discretion can be seen in *Udde. 3 Su. 28*. All other discussions should be understood according to *Purvasutra 13*.

**Presentation of the rule:**

15. If an *acharya* or *upaadhyaya* remembers, but does not present a monk eligible for *badiksha* for *badiksha* even after four or five nights, and at that time, if there is a delay in the *badiksha* of any venerable person of that newly initiated person, then he does not receive any *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance. If there is no venerable person worthy of *badiksha* for that newly initiated person, then he receives *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance for violating four or five nights.

16. If an *acharya* or *upaadhyaya* does not remember and does not present a monk eligible for *badiksha* for *badiksha* even after four or five nights, and at that time, if there is a delay in the *badiksha* of any venerable person of that newly initiated person, then he does not receive any *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance. If there is no venerable person worthy of *badiksha* for that newly initiated person, then he receives *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance for violating four or five nights.

17. If an *acharya* or *upaadhyaya* remembers or does not remember, but does not present a monk eligible for *badiksha* for *badiksha* even after ten nights, and at that time, if there is no venerable person worthy of *badiksha* for that newly initiated person, then he receives *dikshached* or *taparupa* penance for violating ten nights.

---------------------------
## Fourth Objective] [347 17.  

Even if the Acharya or Upadhyaya forgets or does not forget, they should not initiate a worthy Bhikṣu into the Great Initiation after ten days. If, at that time, there is a delay in the Great Initiation of any venerable person who is eligible for the Great Initiation, then they do not incur any Prāyaścitta (penance) in the form of Dīkṣāched (breaking of initiation) or Tapas (austerity). If there is no venerable person eligible for the Great Initiation for that newly initiated Bhikṣu, then they are not eligible to be appointed to the position of Acharya or Ganavacchedaka for one year due to the transgression of ten nights.

**Discussion:** In the reign of the first and last Tirthankaras, Bhikṣus are given the initiation of Samāyikcāritra (minor initiation) and then the Great Initiation of Chhedopasthāpanīyacāritra. Its minimum time limit is seven days and nights, meaning that in terms of time, the newly initiated Bhikṣu is called Kalpāka (eligible for the Great Initiation) after seven nights. In terms of qualities, they are called Kalpāka when they have memorized the necessary sūtras completely with their meaning and method, have acquired general knowledge of Jīvādi (living beings) and Samitis (assemblies), have memorized the meaning and recitation of the four studies of the Daśavakālika Sūtra, and have practiced some daily activities like writing, etc.

Thus, when the newly initiated Bhikṣu becomes Kalpāka (eligible for the Great Initiation) and other tests are completed, they are given the Great Initiation (Upasthāpana). According to Ni. U. 11 Sū. 84, Prāyaścitta is incurred if the Great Initiation is given before the eligibility. If the Acharya or Upadhyaya does not give the Great Initiation to the eligible Kalpāka Bhikṣu at the time mentioned in the sūtras, they incur Prāyaścitta. This Prāyaścitta rule makes it clear that the Acharya or Upadhyaya alone has the right to give new initiation or the Great Initiation, and they are the ones who incur Prāyaścitta if there is any error in it. Other Sadhus, Sadhvīs, or Pravartakas, Pravartiṇīs can also give initiation with the permission of the Acharya or Upadhyaya, but the main responsibility for determining their eligibility lies with the Acharya or Upadhyaya. Generally, according to the Āgamas, all Sadhus and Sadhvīs have the responsibility to guide others, but the instructions regarding the arrangements for the Chhedopasthāpanīyacāritra are within the authority of the Acharya or Upadhyaya. Therefore, they are the ones who are liable for Prāyaścitta if there is any misconduct in this regard.

Here, three options are mentioned in these three sūtras regarding the Great Initiation: (1) transgression of the limit due to forgetfulness, (2) transgression of the limit while remembering, (3) special transgression of the limit due to forgetfulness or non-forgetfulness.

When a Bhikṣu becomes Kalpāka in terms of time and qualities, they can be given the Great Initiation within four or five nights, meaning within four nights and by the fifth day. This is the meaning of the word "Chaurāya Pancharāyaṇo" in the sūtra. This allowance includes many reasons like travel, auspicious days, monthly periods, illness, etc. 

Page #168:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[340] Vyavahar Sutra:** Therefore, after seven days of initiation, the Great Initiation can be given on the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day, and there is no atonement for it. If the twelfth night is violated, then according to Sutras 15-16, atonement is received in the form of appropriate penance or termination of initiation, which is said to be five nights of minor atonement in the commentary. If the initiation's seven nights are violated, then in addition to the appropriate penance or termination of initiation, he is exempted from the Acharya-Upadhyaya position for one year as atonement.

Here, another concession is mentioned in the rules and atonement of the Great Initiation, which is that if the newly initiated monk's parents or any other honorable or benefactor are present, and there is a delay in their becoming Kalpaka, then for their sake, the Great Initiation can be delayed for up to six months, and there is no atonement for it. In the Thanangadi Agamas, seven nights are called the minor Shaikshakala. Therefore, even if eligible, the Great Initiation cannot be given before the completion of seven nights, because until then he is called Shaiksha and Akalpa. Six months are called the "excellent Shaikshakala." Therefore, even for honorable men, the Great Initiation should not be delayed beyond six months. In these Sutras, it is said that the atonement for violating the limit of 4-5 days due to memory or forgetfulness is the same. In the allowance of four to five days, in addition to auspicious days or travel, etc., the reason for non-study due to menstruation, etc., is also included, which can be easily resolved in the allowance of 4-5 days.

**18. The discernment of a monk who has gone to another gana:** If a monk leaves his own gana and accepts another gana to live, and if he meets a fellow monk at that time, and asks: "O Arya! Are you living under someone's guidance?" Then he should name the one who is the eldest in that gana in terms of initiation. 

Page #169:
---------------------------
## Fourth Objective [349 Question - If asked again, "O Venerable one! Under whose leadership are you residing?" Answer - Then, name the one who is the most learned in that order, and say, "I will abide by the instructions of those whose command I am under, and I will reside near them and follow their teachings." Discussion - It is essential for every order to have a learned Acharya-Upadhyaya. However, it is natural for there to be differences in the Upadhyayas' attainment of liberation and their teaching skills. / In a particular order, a disciple of a learned elder Acharya may be sharp-witted and well-versed in scriptures, fulfilling all the responsibilities of the Acharya. Or, the Guru or the Dikshit father of a learned Acharya, etc., may be of a good nature but less learned, and they may be a gem in the order. In such a case, one should understand the subject matter as mentioned in the sutras regarding a monk who goes to study in that order. A monk who is studying may have heard or known about the teaching skills of another monk from a different order and gone to study in that order. / While wandering there, he may encounter a monk from his previous order who is traveling for alms or other purposes. If he asks, "O Arya! Under whose guidance are you wandering?" Then, in response, he should name the Acharya, Guru, or Dikshit father of the learned one, etc., who are the gems in that order. / But, if the questioner is not satisfied, thinking that there are more knowledgeable saints in his own order, and wondering why he left his own order to come to this one, then, for accurate information, he should ask again, "O Bhagavan! Who is your Kalpak? In other words, under whose leadership are you wandering and studying, and who is skilled in teaching in this order?" In response, he should name the one who is the most learned there, i.e., the one who is the head among all the learned ones and the leader of the order. He should say, "All the monks in this order reside and study under their guidance, and I am also wandering and studying according to their instructions." 

## Regarding the rules for going on an "Abhinicharica" 19. If many Sarmic monks wish to go on an "Abhinicharica" together, it is not permissible for them to do so without asking the elder monks. But, if they ask the elder monks, then it is permissible for them to go on an "Abhinicharica" together. / If they are not separated from the elder monks, then it is permissible for them to go on an "Abhinicharica" together. If they are separated from the elder monks, then it is not permissible for them to go on an "Abhinicharica" together. / Those who go on an "Abhinicharica" without being separated from the elder monks should be either in a group or under the protection of someone. 

Page #170:
---------------------------
According to the Vyavahar Sutra, it is considered appropriate to perform 'Abhinicharika' if a Sthavir Sadhu gives permission. If a Sthavir Sadhu does not give permission, then it is not considered appropriate to perform 'Abhinicharika'. If one performs 'Abhinicharika' without obtaining permission from the Sthavirs, they are liable for Dikshached or Parihar Prayschitta.

**Explanation:**

The term 'Abhinicharika Gaman' refers to the practice of a Sadhu, who is weak, unable to perform austerities, and has a thin body due to austerities, going to a nearby village of cowherds to consume milk and other non-vegetarian food.

If any monk or group of monks needs to go to an area where such non-vegetarian food is easily available, it is necessary to obtain permission from the Gachchha-pramukh Acharya or Sthavir. They grant permission for 'Abhinicharika' only if they deem it necessary, otherwise, they may refuse.

In Sutra 4, it is stated that performing Prayschitta is necessary for consuming non-vegetarian food without the specific permission of the Acharya-Upadhyaya. Here, it is stated that performing Prayschitta is necessary for going to 'Vajika' without permission. Therefore, one should not go without permission.

The Bhashya explains that if the Acharya-Upadhyaya has a large number of Sadhus, many Pratichchak Sadhus from other Gachchhas have come for study, there is a lot of coming and going of guest Sadhus, or there are many compassionate Sadhus like Baddha, etc., then due to any of these reasons, if the monks do not get the necessary non-vegetarian food after studying or performing austerities or after performing Prayschitta, and their bodies become thin, then they are given permission to go to 'Vajika' for a fixed number of days, such as 5 days. The entire structure of the Sutra is based on this expectation.

The statement about obtaining permission for general wandering is found in Sutra 2 of Udde. 3.

**Duties of a Charya-Pravesht and Charya-Nivritt Bhikshu:**

20. A Charya-Pravesht Bhikshu should go to the Thera for four or five days, and should be truthful in his speech, truthful in his actions, and should be respectful to his elders. He should not be arrogant or proud.

21. A Charya-Pravesht Bhikshu should go to the Thera for four or five days, and should be respectful to him, should be truthful in his actions, and should be ready to accept any punishment or reprimand. He should be humble and respectful to his elders.

If he says, "Bante! I will always be respectful and humble, and I will always follow the rules," then he should be careful about his body.

## Fourth Objective

**[351 22.** A *charia-niyatta* monk, if he sees (meets) the *theras* within a period of four or five nights, the same *aloyana*, the same *padikkama*, and the same *avagraha* permission for staying until the *kalpa* remains for him. He is in *ahalandam* *avagraha*. **23.** A *charia-niyatta* monk, if he sees (meets) the *theras* after four or five nights, he should again do *aloyana-padikkama* and be present in the necessary *diksha-ched* or *tapa* form of *prayaschitta*. For the sake of *bhikkhu-bhava*, he should take permission for *avagraha* for the second time. He should request in this way - 'O *bhadant*! Give me permission to stay in *mitavagraha*, to do according to *kalpa*, for the fixed rules, that is, to do daily activities, and give me permission to come again.' Saying this, he should touch their feet. **20.** A monk who has entered *charia*, if he sees (meets) the *theras* within a period of four or five nights, the same *aloyana*, the same *padikkama*, and the same *avagraha* permission for staying until the *kalpa* remains for him. **21.** A monk who has entered *charia*, if he sees (meets) the *theras* after four or five nights, he should again do *aloyana-padikkama* and be present in the necessary *diksha-ched* or *tapa* form of *prayaschitta*.

Give me permission to stay in *mitavagraha*, to do according to *kalpa*, for the fixed rules, that is, to do daily activities, and give me permission to come again.' Saying this, he should touch their feet.

**Discussion:**

In this set of four sutras, the word 'charia' has been used with two meanings: (1) *vajika-gaman* as mentioned in the previous sutras, (2) going to a foreign country or a distant land. Here, two types of *charia* have been mentioned: (1) *pravist* - a monk who has stayed in *vajika* for the time for which he has received permission, or a monk who has been on a journey to a foreign country or a distant land. 

Page #172:
---------------------------
## 352] [Vyavahar Sutra (2) A monk who has returned from Nivritta-Jika-Vihar or a distant land, having returned from wandering, should again seek permission and wander in the vicinity. / These Sutras lay down the rules of Vinaya-Vyavahar for monks who have entered and returned from Charika, having obtained permission. / In which a limit of 4-5 days has been set. If the opportunity to meet the Guru, Acharya, etc. arises before these stipulated days, then wandering can be done only with the previous permission, but after these stipulated days, i.e., after 10-20 days or a few months, if the opportunity to meet arises, then permission should be obtained again according to the method mentioned in the Sutras.  Four to five days is a practical limit, as in the case of going to Gochari without knowing the location of the establishment and the king's palace, the dairy, etc., there is a provision for atonement in Nishi. U. 4 and U. 9. There also, a grace period of 4-5 nights has been given. In Sutra 15 of this Uddeshak, a grace period of 4-5 nights has also been given for the establishment. Therefore, even in the present case, it should be considered necessary to obtain permission again from the Guru, etc., after 4-5 days.  The conduct of Shaiksha and Ratnaadhik 24. Two monks wander together, one with a shorter period of initiation and the other with a longer period of initiation. If the one with a shorter period of initiation is learned and has disciples, and the one with a longer period of initiation is not learned and does not have disciples, then the one with a shorter period of initiation should still follow the rules of Vinaya Vyavahar for the one with a longer period of initiation, bring him food, stay near him, and give him disciples to wander with, etc. / 25. Two monks wander together, one with a shorter period of initiation and the other with a longer period of initiation. If the one with a longer period of initiation is learned and has disciples, and the one with a shorter period of initiation is not learned and does not have disciples, then the one with a longer period of initiation may, if he wishes, follow the rules of Vyavahar for the one with a shorter period of initiation, or he may not, if he wishes. / He may, if he wishes, bring him food, or he may not, if he wishes.

---------------------------
## Fourth Objective] [353 If there is a desire, keep it close, if there is no desire, do not keep it / If there is a desire, give a disciple to wander separately, if there is no desire, do not give. Discussion - These sutras state the optional and necessary duties of Ratnaadhikas and Shaiksh Sarmaikas. Here, the monk with a lesser period of initiation is called Shaiksh in comparison to Ratnaadhikas, therefore, from this perspective, even a monk with many years of initiation can be called Shaiksh. (1) If the Ratnaadhikas monk is endowed with disciples etc. and the Shaiksh monk is not endowed with disciples etc., then giving him a disciple to wander or arranging food etc. for him and doing other services is considered optional for the Ratnaadhikas, i.e. they can do so if they deem it appropriate or if they desire. (2) If the Shaiksh monk is endowed with disciples etc. and the Ratnaadhikas monk is not endowed with disciples etc. and he wants to wander or wants to get some service done, then it becomes the duty of the Shaiksh endowed with disciples etc. to honor the Ratnaadhikas and act according to their instructions. This statement is made here from the perspective of duty and right. But if there is a need for service, then it is also necessary for the Ratnaadhikas to serve or get the Shaiksh served as appropriate. If he does not do so, he is liable to atonement. Therefore, it should be understood that the ordinance mentioned in the sutras is in relation to the general situation. The ordinance of wandering with the Ratnaadhikas as the leader is 26. Two monks wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other, it is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink / 27. Two Ganavachcheiyas wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other, it is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink. 28. Two Ayariy-Uvajhaayas wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other / it is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink / 29. Many monks wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other. It is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink. 30. Many Ganavachcheiyas wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other / it is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink. 31. Many Ayariy-Uvajhaayas wander together, it is not appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other / it is appropriate for them to wander together being endowed with each other for food and drink /

[354] [Vyavahar Sutra 32. Many Bhikkhus, many Ganavacchedakas, many Ayariya-Uvajshas live together, they do not find it appropriate to live together after being ordained by each other. / It is appropriate for them to live together after being ordained by each other for the sake of Aharainiya. / 26. If two Bhikkhus live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. / 27. If two Ganavacchedakas live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. 28. If two Pracharayas or two Upadhyayas live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. 29. If many Bhikkhus live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. 30. If many Ganavacchedakas live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. 31. If many Pracharayas or Upadhyayas live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. 32. If many Bhikkhus, many Ganavacchedakas and many Pracharayas or Upadhyayas live together, it is not appropriate for them to live together accepting each other as equal. But it is appropriate to live together accepting the one with more Ratna as the leader. Discussion- If two or more Bhikkhus live together or wander together and do not consider anyone as superior, i.e. do not take Prajna, do not do Vandana, etc., do not follow any Vinaya and Samachari behavior, then it is not appropriate for them to live together in this way. But they should live together accepting the leadership of the Sadhu with more Ratna, following Vinaya-behavior with them and doing every work only after taking their permission. Even while living with the one with more Ratna, not following their Vinaya and obedience does not lead to the progress of knowledge, vision and character, but rather increases self-will, leading to the downfall of the soul and violation of restraint. When the common people come to know, it leads to the downfall of the Jina-shastra. Therefore, ...

---------------------------
It is the essential duty of a [355 Avamaratnik (Shaiksh) Bhikku] to remain with the [Ratnaadhik] accepting their leadership. Similarly, two or more [Pracharys], [Upadhyays], or [Ganavchhedaks] should remain or travel together, and in such a case, the senior [Prachary] etc. should be treated with due respect according to the [Deekshaparaya]. This rule is applicable to [Sam Bhogic Sadhus] who take [Mandalik Ahar], it should be understood. If, at any time, other [Sam Bhogic Sadhus], [Pracharys], [Upadhyays], or [Ganavchhedaks] happen to meet in the same [Upashray] in a village or elsewhere, and there is an occasion to stay together for some time, they can stay together with due respect and love, but the rule of accepting [Sutrokta Upsampada (leadership)] should not be understood here. If it is necessary to travel or observe [Chaturmas] with other [Sam Bhogic Sadhus], or to study, then their [Alpakalin Upsampada (leadership)] should also be accepted. The essence of the fourth [Uddeshak] of [Sutra 18 9-10] is that [Pracharys] and [Upadhyays] should not travel alone, and they should not observe [Chaumas] in two [Thananas], but they can travel in two [Thananas] and observe [Chaturmas] in three [Thananas]. [Ganavchhedaks] should not travel in two [Thananas] and should not observe [Chaturmas] in three [Thananas], but they can travel in three [Thananas] and observe [Chaturmas] in four [Thananas]. If many [Pracharys] etc. have to travel together, they should travel keeping the appropriate number of [Sadhus] in their respective [Nishra], and they should also stay in [Chaturmas] with the same discretion. If, during the time of travel or [Chaturmas], the [Bhikku] who was leading that [Singhade] attains [Kal-Dharma], then the remaining [Sadhus] should accept the leadership of the one who is qualified in [Shruta] and [Paryaya]. If no one is qualified, then [Chaturmas] or travel should be postponed and they should immediately reach the presence of qualified leading [Sadhus] or [Prachary]. When [Achary-Upadhyay] attains [Kal-Dharma] or leaves [Sanayam], the one whom they designate to be appointed to the position of [Achary-Upadhyay] should be established in that position. If that person is not qualified and another is qualified, then the [Bhikku] designated by the [Achary] should be appointed to the position.

##  Translation:

**[Vyavahar Sutra Sutra 15-17 15 20-23]**

A monk who has been given a position, or who has been given a position but is not suitable, can be removed and another suitable monk can be given the position. Those who support the wrong side are all subject to atonement. If a newly ordained monk becomes suitable soon, he should be given the great ordination before the 12th night. If this is violated, the Acharya-Upadhyaya incurs atonement in the form of tapas or chhed. If the 17th night is violated, in addition to tapas or chhed atonement, there is also atonement of being removed from the position for one year. If the violation of the time of the great ordination is due to the ordination of the parents or other revered persons of the newly ordained, then even if the ordination is delayed for six months, there is no atonement. A monk who has gone to another gana for study, etc., should, when asked by someone, first mention the name of the Sarvaratnaadhi. After that, if necessary, the name of the Sarvabahushruta should be mentioned. Before going to Vajika (Gopalak Basti) for the consumption of Vikriti, it is necessary to take the permission of the sthavira, i.e., the guru, etc. It is only permissible to go after obtaining permission. A monk who has entered or left the charika should, after obtaining permission, meet the guru, etc., within 4-5 days. He should then continue to wander or reside according to the previous permission. However, if he meets the guru, etc., after 4-5 days, i.e., after the time of obtaining permission, he should obtain permission again according to the sutra and then wander. It is optional for a Ratnaadhi monk to serve or assist an Avamarani monk, but it is necessary for an Avamarani monk to serve or assist a Ratnaadhi monk. If the Ratnaadhi monk does not want to be served or assisted, it is not necessary. If the Avamarani monk is ill, then the Ratnaadhi monk must also serve or assist him. If many monks, many Acharyas-Upadhyayas, and many Ganavachchedakas, etc., wander together, they should not remain equal to each other. Instead, they should accept the prominence of the one who is Ratnaadhi among them and live with proper vinaya and samacharivyaavahar.

## Fifth Objective

**[359 6.** It is prescribed for a Pravartini to stay with three other Sadhvis during the rainy season. **7.** It is not prescribed for a Ganavacchedini to stay with three other Sadhvis during the rainy season. **8.** It is prescribed for a Ganavacchedini to stay with four other Sadhvis during the rainy season. **9.** During the Hemant and Grishma seasons, it is prescribed for many Pratinis to travel in their own Nishra with two other Sadhvis each, and for many Ganavacchedinis to travel with three other Sadhvis each, in villages or up to the capital. **10.** During the rainy season, it is prescribed for many Pratinis to stay in their own Nishra with three other Sadhvis each, and for many Ganavacchedinis to stay with four other Sadhvis each, in villages or up to the capital.

**Discussion:** In the first ten sutras of the fourth objective, the number of Sadhus who stay together during the travels and Chaturmas of the Pracharaya, Upadhyaya, and Ganavacchedak is mentioned. Here, the number of Sadhvis who stay with the Pravartini and Ganavacchedini is prescribed. In Brihatkalpa Uhe. 5, it is forbidden for a Sadhvi to stay alone, and here it is forbidden for a Pratini to travel with only one other Sadhvi. Therefore, a Pratini should not travel with one Sadhvi, but should travel with two Sadhvis and stay with three Sadhvis during Chaturmas. The Ganavacchedini is the main assistant of the Pravartini. Her area of work is as vast as that of the Ganavacchedak, and she oversees all the work of the Sadhvis, such as their arrangement, service, and penance, under the orders of the Pravartini. Therefore, the Ganavacchedini should travel with three other Sadhvis and stay with four other Sadhvis during Chaturmas. From the prescriptions of Brihatkalpa Udde. 5 and the descriptions of these sutras, it becomes clear that a Sadhvi should not travel alone, but two Sadhvis can travel together or stay together during Chaturmas. Because there is no prohibition in any prescription of the Agam for them to travel with two. However, according to the prescriptions of the Sampradayik Samachariyas, it is considered forbidden for two Sadhvis to travel and stay together during Chaturmas. At the same time, going and coming with two Sadhvis for the purpose of service, etc., under the orders of the Pravartini, etc., is also considered Agam-sammat. Other necessary discussions should be understood in the same way as the ten sutras of the fourth objective.

**Duty of a Sadhvi when the leading Sadhvi is performing Kal:**

**11.** If a Nigganthi, who is a Duijjamani, travels in front of a village, she is also a Visubhejjya. If there is someone here who is eligible for Upasampada, she should be Upasampadit. If there is no one here who is eligible for Upasampada, then she should perform her own Kappan according to her ability. She should perform it in a way that is appropriate for a single person, and she should travel in all directions, seeing all the people, and she should travel in all directions, seeing all the people. 

Page #180:
---------------------------
360. If a *sadhvi* is not staying in a place for the purpose of *vihar* (travel), then it is permissible for her to stay there for the purpose of *karan* (reason). If the reason for staying is over, then someone should tell her, "O *Arye*, stay for one or two nights." If she stays for one or two nights, then it is permissible. But if she stays for more than one or two nights, then it is not permissible. If a *sadhvi* stays for more than one or two nights, then she is liable for *diksha-chhed* (loss of initiation) or *tap* (penance) as a *parihara* (atonement). 12. If a *sadhvi* who is leading a group of *sadhvis* during *vasa-vas* (rainy season retreat) dies, then the remaining *sadhvis* should choose a suitable *sadhvi* to lead them. If there is no other suitable *sadhvi* and the remaining *sadhvi* has not completed the study of *prachar-prakalp* (canonical texts), then she should travel in the direction where other *sadhvis* are traveling, staying one night at each place. It is not permissible for her to stay for the purpose of *vihar*. If there is a reason for staying, such as illness, then it is permissible. When the reason for staying is over, if someone tells her, "O *Arye*, stay for one or two nights," then it is permissible for her to stay for one or two nights. But it is not permissible for her to stay for more than one or two nights. If a *sadhvi* stays for more than one or two nights, then she is liable for *diksha-chhed* or *tap* as a *parihara*. 11. If a group of *sadhvis* are traveling from village to village and the *sadhvi* who is leading them dies, then the remaining *sadhvis* should choose a suitable *sadhvi* to lead them. If there is no other suitable *sadhvi* and the remaining *sadhvi* has not completed the study of *nisith* (canonical texts), then she should travel in the direction where other *sadhvis* are traveling, staying one night at each place. It is not permissible for her to stay for the purpose of *vihar*. If there is a reason for staying, such as illness, then it is permissible. When the reason for staying is over, if someone tells her, "O *Arye*, stay for one or two nights," then it is permissible for her to stay for one or two nights. But it is not permissible for her to stay for more than one or two nights. If a *sadhvi* stays for more than one or two nights, then she is liable for *diksha-chhed* or *tap* as a *parihara*. 

Page #181:
---------------------------
## Fifth Objective] [361 If it is necessary to stay due to illness or other reasons, it is permissible. If, after the illness or other reasons have subsided, someone says, "O Arya! Stay for one or two more nights," then it is permissible to stay for one or two more nights. But it is not permissible to stay for more than one or two nights. A Sadhvi who stays for more than one or two nights is liable to Dikshached or Tap रूप Prāyaścitta due to violation of the rules. Discussion - The eleventh and twelfth sutras of the fourth objective describe the attainment of Kaladharma by the leading Sadhu, and here the attainment of Kaladharma by the leading Sadhvi is described. The discussion of other Sadhvis becoming or being made the leading Sadhvi or going on Vihar should be understood in the same way as the fourth objective. In the sutra, "Tise Ya Appano Kappae" and "Vasahi Ajje" etc., the use of the singular is directed towards the leading Sadhvi, and because the description of becoming or being made the leading Sadhvi is present, the presence of many Sadhvis is also clear from the sutra. The instruction to give the position by Pratino is 13. Pavattini Ya Gilayamani Annyar Vaejja - "Mae Nan Ajje! Kalagyae Samanie Iyam Samukkasivava." Sa Ya Samukkasinaritha Samukkasivva, Sa Ya No Samukkasinaritha No Samukkasianya / Asthi Ya Itth Anna Kai Samukkasinaritha Sa Samukkasianva / Nasthi Ya Itth Anna Kai Samukkasinaritha Sa Chev Samukkasivva / Tae Chan Nan Samukkitthae Para Vaejja "Dussamukkitth Te Ajje / Nikkhivahi" Tae Nan Nivakhamanaae Nasthi Kei Chhae Va Parihaare Va / Jamo Sahammineo Ahakkappam No Utthae Viharanti Savvassi Tasi Tappattiyam Chhae Va Parihaare Va. 14, Pavattini Ya Ohayamani Annyaram Vaejja "Mae Nan Ajje!

## व्यवहारसूत्र

**13.** If a *pravartini* (leader) who is about to die tells a prominent *sadhvi* (nun), "O *Arye*! When I pass away, please appoint *[name of sadhvi]* to my position." If the *sadhvi* designated by the *pravartini* is qualified for the position, she should be appointed. If she is not qualified, she should not be appointed. If there is another *sadhvi* in the community who is qualified, she should be appointed. If there is no other qualified *sadhvi* in the community, the *sadhvi* designated by the *pravartini* should be appointed. After she is appointed, if a *geetarth* *sadhvi* (nun who sings devotional songs) says, "O *Arye*! You are not qualified for this position, therefore, please relinquish it," and she relinquishes the position, she is not liable for *dikshached* (loss of initiation) or *tap* (penance). If the *svadharmini* *sadhvis* (nuns who follow their own dharma) do not ask her to relinquish the position of *pravartini* or other positions according to the *kalp* (duty), then all the *svadharmini* *sadhvis* are liable for *dikshached* or *tap* for this reason.

**14.** If a *pravartini* who is about to abandon *sanjam* (self-restraint) tells a prominent *sadhvi*, "O *Prarthe*! When I leave, please appoint *[name of sadhvi]* to my position." If she is qualified for the position, she should be appointed. If she is not qualified, she should not be appointed. If there is another *sadhvi* in the community who is qualified, she should be appointed. If there is no other qualified *sadhvi* in the community, the *sadhvi* designated by the *pravartini* should be appointed. After she is appointed, if a *geetarth* *sadhvi* says, "O *Prarthe*! You are not qualified for this position, therefore, please relinquish it," and she relinquishes the position, she is not liable for *dikshached* or *tap*. If the *svadharmini* *sadhvis* do not ask her to relinquish the position of *pravartini* according to the *kalp*, then all the *svadharmini* *sadhvis* are liable for *dikshached* or *tap* for this reason.

**Discussion:** The *acharya* (spiritual leader) is the religious leader of all the *sadhus* and *sadhvis* of their *gachch* (lineage). Therefore, their specific decisions must be accepted by all the *sadhvis*, meaning they must follow their instructions. 

Page #183:
---------------------------
A Sadhvi can be appointed to the Pravartiini position, but according to the Sutras, Sadhvis or Pravartiinis can also appoint other qualified Sadhvis to the Pravartiini position, unlike the general rules. This is clear from these Sutras. Other discussions should be understood in the same way as Sutras 13-14 of the fourth Uddeshak. 

**15. If a newly initiated, young, or adolescent Nirgrantha forgets the Acharaprakalp (Acharanga-Nishīthasūtra), he should be asked, "O Arya! For what reason have you forgotten the study of the Acharaprakalp? Did you forget due to some reason or due to negligence?"**

[364] [Vyavahar Sutra] If he says that he has forgotten due to carelessness and not for any reason, then he is not eligible to be given or hold the position of Acharya or Ganavcchedak for life. If he says, "I have forgotten due to such and such reason, not due to carelessness, and I will now memorize the Pracharprakalp again," and memorizes it, then he is eligible to be given or hold the position of Acharya or Ganavcchedak. If he says that he will memorize the Pracharprakalp again but does not memorize it, then he is not eligible to be given or hold the position of Acharya or Ganavcchedak. 16. If a newly initiated, young, or adolescent Nirgranthi forgets the study of Pracharprakalp, then he should be asked, "O dear! Why have you forgotten the study of Pracharprakalp? Have you forgotten due to any reason or due to carelessness?" If he says, "I have forgotten due to carelessness and not for any reason," then he is not eligible to be given or hold the position of Pravartini or Ganavcchedini for life. If he says, "I have forgotten due to such and such reason, not due to carelessness, and I will now memorize the Pracharprakalp again," and memorizes it, then he is eligible to be given or hold the position of Pravartini or Ganavcchedini. If he says that he will memorize the Pracharprakalp again but does not memorize it, then he is not eligible to be given or hold the position of Pravartini or Ganavcchedini. / Discussion - In the third Sutra of the third Uddeshak, a Shraman who has completed three years of Dikshaparaya is asked to memorize the "Pracharprakalp." These Sutras state that it is necessary for every Shraman and Shramani to memorize the Acharprakalp and keep it memorized. It is also stated that it is the duty of the leading Shramans of the Gachchha to check from time to time whether any Shraman has forgotten the Acharprakalp. If he has forgotten, then the reason should be ascertained. The Sutra also states that if a Shraman or Shramani who has forgotten the Acharprakalp is newly initiated, young, or adolescent, then he or she receives the prescribed atonement. There are two types of atonement, namely (1) If he forgets due to a reason, then he cannot hold any position until he memorizes it again, and he cannot wander around as a (Singhadarapramukh). (2) If he forgets due to carelessness, then he cannot hold any position for life, and he cannot wander around as a (Singhadarapramukh). "Pracharprakalp" here refers to Acharang and Nishisth Sutra. Detailed explanation regarding this should be known from the discussion of Uddeshak 3 Sutra 3.

[Fifth Objective] _ In these sutra-statements of three and five, the importance of the _Pracharprakalpa_ is explained. Keeping this in mind and considering it, if a decision is made about its creation, it is easily decided that the author of this _Vyavaharsutra_, _Sthavir_ Bhadrabahu Swami, or some _Sthavir_ after him, did not create the 'Pracharprakalpa', but it is _Ganadhar_ created and from the beginning, it is a scripture that all the _sadhu-sadhvi_ of the _Jinshasan_ have to study.  /  Currently, this scripture is indicative of both _Acharang_ + _Nishit_ sutras. The _niyuktikar_ of _Dashashrutskandh_ has, in the first verse of the _niyukti_, honored _Sthavir_ Shri Pratham Bhadrabahu Swami, saluting him and calling him 'the creator of the three _chedasutras_ ( _Dashashrutskandh_, _Brihatkalp_ and _Vyavaharsutra_)'. And Shri Bhadrabahu Swami, in this _Vyavaharsutra_ composed by him ( _nirydh_), has directed the _Pracharprakalpa_ sixteen times, making many kinds of provisions. Even though this is so clear, due to historical misconceptions, present-day historians present their doubtful views about the author of this sutra and his time, which is a matter of great regret. The provisions of the _Vyavaharsutra_ related to _Pracharprakalpa_ make it clear that it is absolutely essential for every _sadhu-sadhvi_ to memorize the _Acharang-Nishit_ sutra with its meaning and purpose, and it is also necessary to keep it memorized through _swadhyay_ etc.  /  Any _shraman_ or _shramani_ who is not capable of studying it, or does not study it, or after studying it, forgets it by not doing _swadhyay_, they are the _shraman_ or _shramani_ who are ineligible to take any position in the _Jinshasan_ or to hold a previously held position, i.e. they cannot be given any position and if they are already in a position, they are removed from the position. They do not have the right to wander even as _singhadarapramukh_, and they cannot do any kind of _ganavyutsarg_ sadhana, i.e. _ekalvihar_, _sanbhog-pratyakhyan_ etc. sadhanas.  The monk who holds the _Pracharprakalpa_ is called _jghanya geetarth_ or _jghanya bahushrat_. He alone is worthy of independent wandering or _gochari_. The use of materials obtained from the investigation of _abahu-shrut_ or _agi-tath_ is also prohibited in _bhap_ and _prayashchit_ is said. Currently, it is _agam_ -compliant to believe that the knowledge of the _purva_ is broken, but it cannot be said that the other sutras are broken.  /  Therefore, it is completely inappropriate to believe that the conduct of these _Vyavaharsutra_ -stated provisions is broken based on the area or time.  /  Because if the many young _shraman-shramani_ who are being initiated today get qualified teachers, they can definitely memorize this much study in three years. But it is with great regret that I have to say that due to indifference in the field of study, out of the approximately ten thousand (10,000) Jain _sadhu-sadhvi_ currently present, not even ten _sadhu-sadhvi_ are holding this _Pracharprakalpa_ memorized with its meaning. Still, there are many _prachar_ , _upaadhyay_ in society, and many are eager to get positions. There are also many _sadhu-sadhvi_ who wander as _singhadarapramukh_, and they also consider themselves to be wandering according to _pagman_.  /  But according to _agam_, how is the arrangement of study, wandering and positions of the _gachch_ 

Page #186:
---------------------------
[366] Those who do not make an effort to understand and follow the *Vyavahar Sutra* through the examination of these *Chhed Sutras* are simply neglecting the *Agam* teachings. Therefore, the current *Padavihars* and *Gachchhapramuks* must pay attention to this and maintain the study system of the *Agam* uninterrupted. That is, every newly initiated young *Sant-Sati* should be made fully competent in *Agam* study and self-aware *Samyam* observance for at least three to five or ten years with proper arrangements. This is the paramount duty of every *Padavihars*, *Gachchhapramuks* and *Guru*. Only by doing so can they benefit their disciples. In *Dasha. Da. 4*, similar duties towards the disciple are mentioned for the *Prachar* etc., and it is said that they should be freed from their debt by fulfilling these duties. See the discussion there. Are the many *Padavihars* who do not do this today aware of their duties? And are they grateful to *Jinshasan*? Or are they satisfied with gaining prestige through positions? After deep reflection on this matter, those who are self-interested seekers dedicated to *Jinshasan* should make arrangements for the study, teaching and bestowing of positions according to the *Agam*, and strive to make the distorted tradition conform to the *Agam*. Currently, there is also a belief that if one has heard the recitation of the *Pracharang* and *Nishith Sutra* once from a *Guru*, then one can become a *Praमुख* and wander or hold a position, and by doing so, one is following the *Sutra* teachings. However, upon deeply understanding the provisions made in these two *Sutras*, the above belief is proven to be merely a self-imagined fantasy. Because these *Sutras* clearly state that every *Sadhu-Sadhvi* should memorize the *Prachar Prakalp* due to the provisions regarding forgetting it, etc. Many *Prachar* also believe that "the study and teaching of the *Nishith Sutra* is prohibited for *Sadhvi* by *Arya Rakshit*". This is also a contrary imagination to the *Agam*. Because the present sixteenth *Sutra* clearly states that *Sadhvi* should memorize the *Prachar Prakalp*. No *Prachar* has the right to establish a tradition by giving teachings contrary to the *Agam* teachings, and *Sadhe Navpurvi Arya Rakshit Swami* could not have given such an order. Nevertheless, many such incongruous fantasies become prevalent in the name of history. Therefore, one should be wary of imagined fantasies and give prominence to the *Sutra* teachings. The provision for the *Sthavir* to repeat the *Achar Prakalp* is as follows: 17. *Theranang Therabhumipattanang Ayarpakappe Nama Ajzhayane Paribhatte Sia, Kappai Tessi Santhavettang Va, Asanthavettang Va Prayariyattan Va Jav Ganavachcheiyattan Va Uddisittae Va Dharettae Va*. 18. *Theranang Therabhumipattanang Ayarpakappe Nama Ajzhayane Parismathe Sia, Kappai Tessi   

Page #187:
---------------------------
[Fifth Objective] [367] The name *Ayarappakka* is given to the study of the *Sanniṣaṇṇāṇa*, *Santuyāṇa*, *Uttāṇayāṇa*, or *Pāsillāyāṇa* whether it is remembered or not, whether it is questioned or not. 17. If a *sthavira* (elder) who has attained *sthaviratva* (old age) forgets the study of the *ācāra-prakalpa* (rules of conduct), they are still eligible to be given or to hold the position of *ācārya* or *gaṇāvacchedaka*. 18. If a *sthavira* who has attained *sthaviratva* forgets the study of the *ācāra-prakalpa*, they are still eligible to remember and repeat the study of the *ācāra-prakalpa* two or three times while sitting, lying down, sleeping in the *uttānāsana* position, or lying on their side. / _Discussion_ - The subject matter of the previous two sūtras is being stated here with respect to *sthavira* monks and nuns. In the commentary, a person between forty and sixty-seven years of age is called *prauḍha* (mature), and a person over sixty-seven years of age is called *sthavira*. However, in the *Ṭhānāṅgasūtra* and the *Vyavahārasūtra* (Objective 10, etc.), a person sixty years of age is called *sthavira*. Therefore, a person between forty and sixty-nine years of age should be considered *prauḍha*. The present two sūtras make an exception for *sthavira* monks, which cannot be understood for *prauḍha*. Therefore, the inclusion of *prauḍha* in the previous two sūtras should be understood by implication or by the *pariseṣa-nyāya* (rule of residue). Because, until that age, the ability to retain the scriptures in memory does not decline much. It is more likely that memory will decline after the age of sixty. Therefore, it should be understood that the atonement for forgetting the *ācāra-prakalpa* by *prauḍha* monks and nuns is also implied in the previous two sūtras. The seventeenth sūtra states that if a *sthavira* monk forgets the *ācāra-prakalpa* and is able to recall it or not, they can be given any position and can also hold the position previously given to them. / The intention of these sūtras is that a *sthavira* monk should still try to recall the *ācāra-prakalpa*, but if they are unable to recall it, they do not incur any atonement. The eighteenth sūtra also clarifies that they can listen to the sūtras from other monks while lying down or sitting, or they can ask if they have forgotten any part of it. / Thus, this sūtra indicates that even in old age, a monk should be fond of studying. The use of the phrase "therāṇam therabhūmipattāṇam" in the sūtra indicates that this exception should be understood with respect to those who are *sthavira* in age but who have reached old age, i.e., whose physical strength and sensory abilities have declined.

[368] [On the Conduct Sutra, Mutual Criticism, Methods and Prohibitions 19. If a monk and a nun are in a Saambhogika relationship, they should not criticize each other in each other's presence. If there is someone worthy of criticism on their own side, then it is permissible to criticize in their presence. If there is no one worthy of criticism on their own side, then it is permissible for the monk and nun to criticize each other. 19. If a monk and a nun are in a Saambhogika relationship, they should not criticize each other in each other's presence. If there is someone worthy of criticism on their own side, then it is permissible to criticize in their presence. If there is no one worthy of criticism on their own side, then it is permissible for the monk and nun to criticize each other. Discussion - The Brihatkalpa Sutra, in its fourth Uddesaka, describes twelve Saambhogika behaviors, and states that, according to the Utsargika method, six Saambhogika behaviors should be maintained with nuns. Accordingly, there is no behavior of a Maandalik Pahaar with nuns, and there is also no exchange of food, etc., with them without a strong reason, yet they are still considered Saambhogika because they are under the command of a single Acharya and belong to the same Gachchha. Even for such Saambhogika monks and nuns, it is forbidden to engage in mutual criticism, repentance, atonement, etc. That is, the monk should only criticize his faults, perform atonement, etc., in the presence of the Acharya, Upadhyaya, Stavira, etc., and the nun should only criticize her faults, perform atonement, etc., in the presence of the Pravartini, Stavira, etc., worthy Shramanis. This is the Vidhimarg or Utsargmarg. According to the Apavadmarg, if there is no one worthy of criticism or atonement in a particular gana, then, due to circumstances, the monk can criticize, repent, and atone in the presence of a nun of his own Gachchha, and the nun can criticize, etc., in the presence of a monk of her own Gachchha. This rule makes it clear that, in general, even monks and nuns of the same Gachchha should not criticize or atone for each other. In the commentary, explaining the negative consequences of mutual criticism, it is stated that if a monk or nun has to criticize someone regarding a violation of the fourth vow, and the monk or nun listening to the criticism is also overcome by lust, then on such an occasion, he or she may get an opportunity to express his or her feelings and may say, "You have to perform atonement anyway, so fulfill my desire once, then we can perform atonement together." Thus, there is a possibility of further downfall of each other due to mutual criticism. Even when criticizing other faults, there is a possibility of such faults arising due to repeated contact between the monk and nun in seclusion. 

Page #189:
---------------------------
## Fifth Objective:

For the same reasons, apart from self-study or reading, all types of contact between sadhus and sadhvis is prohibited. Therefore, they should not visit each other's shelters for general conversation, mere darshan, or for the sake of tradition. Visiting for service, as specified in the Sthananga Sutra, or in other such circumstances, is permissible according to the Agamas. A detailed description of the prohibition of mutual contact between sadhus and sadhvis can be found in the discussion of Brihatkalpa Sutra 3, Sutra 1. This Sutra prohibits many activities, including sitting, standing, etc., in each other's shelters. The rules regarding mutual service are as follows:

**20. "Jao sadhu aaro sadhviya sambhogika hai, unhe paraspar ek dusre ki vaiyaavrutya karna nahin kalpata hai. Yadi swapksh mein koi vaiyaavrutya karne wala ho to usi se vaiyaavrutya karana kalpata hai. Yadi swapksh mein vaiyaavrutya karne wala koi nahin ho to sadhu-sadhvi ko paraspar vaiyaavrutya karna kalpata hai."**

**20. "If a sadhu and a sadhvi are sambhogika, they should not perform vaiyaavrutya for each other. If there is someone in their own group who can perform vaiyaavrutya, then they should perform it with that person. If there is no one in their own group who can perform vaiyaavrutya, then the sadhu and sadhvi can perform vaiyaavrutya for each other."**

**Discussion:** The previous Sutra prohibited mutual criticism between sadhus and sadhvis, and this Sutra prohibits performing each other's tasks. For the sake of their samayam, sadhus and sadhvis should first try to perform all necessary tasks related to their bodies and equipment themselves. If they are unable to do so, they can ask other sadhus or sadhvis for help. This is the proper way. If, due to illness or other reasons, they are unable to perform a necessary task, they can, with discretion, ask another sadhu or sadhvi for help. This is an exception. Therefore, without a specific reason, sadhus and sadhvis should not perform any tasks for each other.

The main reason for prohibiting these mutual interactions is that they can lead to excessive contact, increase attachment, and ultimately cause a lapse in brahmacharya. Additionally, seeing such unnecessary mutual contact can create various doubts in the minds of the general public. Therefore, sadhus and sadhvis should conduct themselves according to the rules laid out in the Sutras.

**Examples of service that can be performed mutually:**

1. Bringing and receiving food and water, or inviting each other.
2. Requesting and providing clothing, utensils, or other equipment.

---------------------------
## 370] [Vyavahar Sutra (3) The work of tools - sewing, joining, applying medicine, etc. (4) Washing clothes, cleaning, etc. (5) Making and giving tools for cleaning, etc. (6) Doing transcription, etc. /  Many such tasks should be understood as much as possible. It is not appropriate for Sadhus and Sadhvis to do or have these tasks done without proper circumstances, and doing or having them done results in Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. Even those with the title of Acharya, etc., cannot perform services like transcription, etc., for Sadhvis, except to show devotion / If Acharya, etc., have their work done without reason, they are also subject to Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. The implication is that Sadhus who live together and can do service work should not have it done by Sadhvis, similarly, Sadhvis should not have any work done by Sadhus unless other Sadhvis are available to do it. 

**Rules and prohibitions regarding snakebite treatment**

21. If a Niggranth or Niggranthi is bitten by a snake at night or in the evening (twilight), and at that time a woman Niggranth treats the snakebite of a man Niggranthi, or a man Niggranthi treats the snakebite of a woman Niggranth, then this type of treatment is permissible for them / This type of treatment does not affect their Niggranth status, and they are not subject to Pratikraman / This is the conduct of Sthavirkalpi Sadhus. It is not permissible for Jinkalpi Sadhus to receive this type of treatment, and if they do, they lose their Jinkalp status and are subject to Pratikraman. This is the conduct of Jinkalpi Sadhus.

**Discussion**

The Brihatkalpasutra mentions 6 types of Kalpasthiti in its 6th Uddeshak, meaning 6 types of conduct. There, the conduct of Sthavirkalpi and Jinkalpi is described differently / An example of this difference in conduct is explained in this Sutra. The main difference between the two is that Sthavirkalpi can follow the path of exception, as per the situation, in matters of bodily care, medical treatment, and circumstances, but Jinkalpi strictly follow the path of Utsarga. They do not engage in any kind of medical treatment, bodily care, etc. 

Page #191:
---------------------------
[371 Fifth Uddeshak] They cannot protect their bodies, etc., and they also follow many other types of specific Samachari. The present Sutra states that if a Sthavirakalpi Bhikshu is bitten by a snake, he can have the snake's poison removed by a Mantravadi. He can also get treatment for snakebite at night, and a Sadhvi can get treatment for snakebite from a man at night, and a Sadhu can get treatment from a woman at night. If any Sthavirakalpi is strong-willed and does not want to get treatment, it is up to him, i.e., the dispensation given in the Sutras or the dispensation implied by the Sutras is always optional for the Sthavirakalpi. There is no choice of free will in the Sadhana of a Jinakalpi. He has to follow the vows taken without attachment to the body throughout his life. Even the consumption of Nirvady Apavad breaks their Jinakalp, for which they are liable to atonement. The Sthavirakalpi does not have to atone for the consumption of Nirvady Apavad due to circumstances, and in some circumstances, the consumption of Savad Apavad also requires very little atonement. But they also have to undergo special atonement for violating the limits without reason. The specific Samachari followed by a Jinakalpi are: 1. Going out for Gochari only in the third Prahar and also going out for Vihar only in the third Prahar. 2. Eating only rough and uncoated food, going out for Gochari with Abhigha, and taking food, etc., from one of the last five Pindeshana. 3. Taking clothes, utensils, etc., only from the third or fourth Vastraishana-Patraishana (Padima). 4. Not keeping any auxiliary title, therefore not keeping a Sanstarakpatta or an Asana. 5. Mostly doing Kayotsarga or spending time in Utkuta Asana except for the third Prahar. 6. Using only a Pat, Sanstarak or Prithvishila that is laid down. 7. Staying in a place suitable for observing restraint for the whole month and not going out for Vihar in Chaturmas for any reason. 8. Following two Samachari out of ten types of Samachari. 9. Parthana only on land that is free from the 10 defects of Sthandila, otherwise not Parthana. 10. Not cleaning the house, covering or closing holes, not opening or closing doors. 11. Not taking anything without the wish of the householder or not behaving in a way that is unpleasant to them. 12. Not staying in a house if someone asks, "How many Sadhus are you, how long will you stay?" with such intentions.

If someone forgets the Sutra due to illness, they can be given the [Sutra] again after memorizing it upon recovery. For a senior monk, forgetting the memorized Sutra due to old age is forgivable, and there is no penance even if they cannot remember it again. An elderly monk can recite, listen to, or ask about the Sutra while lying down or sitting. Without special circumstances, monks and nuns should not criticize or perform penance for each other. Monks and nuns should not perform any service for each other. They can serve each other in special circumstances as mentioned in the Agamas. If a snake bites, it is permissible for a monk following the [Sthavira] tradition to seek mantra treatment, but it is not permissible for a monk following the [Jina] tradition to seek or provide treatment. There is no penance for a monk following the [Sthavira] tradition for seeking such treatment. A monk following the [Jina] tradition incurs penance for doing so.

## Sixth Uddeshak: Rules and Prohibitions for Visiting Relatives and Home

1. If a _bhikkhu_ desires to visit their relatives' home, it is not permissible to do so without asking the _theras_. It is permissible to visit their relatives' home after asking the _theras_. If the _theras_ give permission, it is permissible to visit their relatives' home. If the _theras_ do not give permission, it is not permissible to visit their relatives' home. If someone goes to their relatives' home without the _theras_' permission, they are subject to _dikshachhed_ or _tapas_ as atonement.

It is not permissible for an _alpaśruta_ and _alpaāgamna_ _bhikkhu_ or _bhikkhuni_ to visit their relatives' home alone. However, it is permissible to visit their relatives' home with a _bahuśruta_ and _bahuāgamna_ _bhikkhu_ in the community.

If someone goes to their relatives' home, they should offer _puva_ (food) first and then _chāulodaṇa_ (rice). They should offer _bhilingsūva_ (clothes) after _chāulodaṇa_. It is not permissible to offer _bhilingsūva_ before _chāulodaṇa_. If someone goes to their relatives' home, they should offer _bhilingsūva_ first and then _chāulodaṇa_. It is permissible to offer _bhilingsūva_ before _chāulodaṇa_, but not _chāulodaṇa_ before _bhilingsūva_.

If someone goes to their relatives' home, they should offer two _puva_ and two _bhilingsūva_. If someone goes to their relatives' home, they should not offer two _bhilingsūva_ after offering two _puva_. If someone goes to their relatives' home and offers _puva_ first, it is permissible to offer _bhilingsūva_. If someone goes to their relatives' home and offers _chāulodaṇa_ first, it is not permissible to offer _bhilingsūva_.

## Sixth Uddeshak [375]

If rice is cooked before the arrival of the Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis at the house of a relative, and lentils are cooked afterwards, then it is permissible to take rice, but not lentils. If lentils are cooked before the arrival, and rice is cooked afterwards, then it is permissible to take lentils, but not rice. If both lentils and rice are cooked before the arrival, then it is permissible to take both. If both are cooked afterwards, then it is not permissible to take either. Thus, it is permissible to take food that has been kept away from fire, etc., before the arrival of the monk at the house of a relative. It is not permissible to take food that has been kept away from fire after the arrival.

**Discussion:** Just as the general guidance of the Guru is taken for taking food, so also, according to Nishita U. 4, it is necessary to take specific guidance from the Acharya, etc., for taking food that is not suitable. Similarly, in this sutra, in addition to receiving general permission for begging, it is stipulated that specific permission must be obtained to go to the homes of one's family members. A monk who is Bahushruta can go to the homes of his relatives for begging on his own initiative after receiving permission. But a monk who is Abahushruta and has been ordained for less than three years cannot go on his own initiative even after receiving permission, but can only go to the homes of his relatives with a Bahushruta monk.

The word "Nayavihi" is used in the sutra. It encompasses all purposes for going to the homes of relatives. Therefore, it is necessary to follow the method described in this sutra for going for any purpose, such as going for a visit. If this method is violated, the monk is liable to perform the appropriate penance or Chhed-rupa Praayaschitta.

The latter part of the sutra contains reflections on begging. This type of reflection is not mentioned in the 42 faults of investigation, nor in the Pindeshana study of the Acharanga Sutra and the Dashavaikalika Sutra. However, along with the rules for visiting the homes of relatives, this detailed rule is presented in this sutra and in Dasha. Da. 6 and Dasha Da. 8. Therefore, this is not a fault of Eshana, but a fault related to the homes of relatives.

The meaning of this sutra here is that there is a lot of devotion or affection in the homes of relatives. For this reason, Pracha. Shra. 2 A. 1 U. 9 also prohibits going to these homes a second time if the time for visiting is not appropriate, and Nishita U. 2 mentions penance for going to the homes of relatives a second time. However, there is no prohibition or penance for going to other homes a second time, because this rule is not included in the general rules of Eshana. 

Page #196:
---------------------------
In addition to this, it is essential to understand that this discretion should also be exercised in homes where there is great devotion and affection. Because there is always a possibility of such faults occurring there as well. This section of the sutra explains that after entering a family home for a gochari, one should not accept any food that has been prepared or removed from the stove, such as rice, lentils, bread, milk, etc. Whether the sadhu is the cause of the removal of that food or not, such food is unacceptable in a known family. One should only accept food that has been prepared or removed from the stove before entering the home. There is no prohibition in the sutra against accepting such food in unfamiliar or slightly familiar homes. The reason for this is that devotees, relatives, etc., may sometimes act in a way that violates the agnikaya due to their devotion to the sadhu, but this fault is not likely in slightly familiar or less devoted homes. Therefore, this rule is not applicable in those families. That is why this rule is only associated with the families of relatives in the scriptures. There are five atiśayas of the ācārya and upādhyāya in the gana, as follows: 1. The ācārya and upādhyāya, while inside the upāśraya, may wipe or clean their feet, which are covered in dust, with a cloth, without violating the maryaada (jina-ājñā).

## Sixth Objective] [377 2. If an Acharya or Upadhyaya discards waste like excreta and urine inside the Upashraya, it does not violate the code of conduct. 3. If a strong Acharya or Upadhyaya desires to perform service, they may do so, and if they do not desire, they may not do so, still, it does not violate the code of conduct. 4. If an Acharya or Upadhyaya stays alone for one or two nights inside the Upashraya due to a special reason, it does not violate the code of conduct. 5. If an Acharya or Upadhyaya stays alone for one or two nights outside the Upashraya due to a special reason, it does not violate the code of conduct. 3. Two Atiśaya (extraordinary privileges) are mentioned for the Ganavacchedaka in the Gan, namely: 1. If the Ganavacchedaka stays alone for one or two nights inside the Upashraya (due to a special reason), it does not violate the code of conduct. 2. If the Ganavacchedaka stays alone for one or two nights outside the Upashraya (due to a special reason), it does not violate the code of conduct. Some special features of the Vivecanacarakalpa are indicated here by the word "Atiśaya". In the fifth and seventh studies of the Thananga Sutra, five and seven Atiśaya of the Acharya-Upadhyaya are also mentioned. There, the five Atiśaya are similar to the present Sutra, and two special ones are mentioned, namely (1) Upakaranatiśaya and (2) Bhaktapanatiśaya. In the Bhashya, five special Atiśaya are mentioned in place of these two, namely: Bhatte, Pane, Dhuvane, Pasansana Hatthapaysoe Ya. Payarie Atiśesa, Pranatiśesa Anayarie // 229 // The Bhashya Gatha from 230 to 246 discusses this, its summary is as follows: (1) Giving the Acharya food free from all defects, suitable for the region and time, (2) Giving the Acharya pure water free from bitter, pungent, sour, etc. tastes, (3) Giving them clothes, etc. that are pleasing to the Acharya's mind, body, and senses, and cleaning their equipment as needed when they become soiled. (4) Praising them for the qualities they possess, such as profound, gentle, forgiving, etc. qualities, possessing many virtues of restraint, learned, grateful, giver, born of a noble family, free from disturbances, peaceful, well-versed, ascetic, etc. (5) Keeping their hands, feet, mouth, and eyes clean by washing them. The Bhashya Gatha from 238 to 246 explains with examples that if the Acharya has a strong body, is naturally pure, is brilliant and glorious, then they should not be served with the above-mentioned Atiśaya practices. 

Page #198:
---------------------------
[378] [Vyavahar Sutra] Other sadhus should make a living from ordinary food, etc., but due to reasons like illness, even an ordinary bhikṣu can accept these practices. The meaning of the five atiśayas mentioned in the sutra is: - (1) Ācārya, etc., can purify themselves by washing their feet even within the upāśraya. (2) Even when there is a pure and suitable place outside the village, etc., they can defecate in a place adjacent to the upāśraya. (3) They can perform many collective tasks like going to the pasture, etc., or service tasks like washing clothes, etc., if they wish, otherwise, even if they have the strength, they can have it done by others.  /  (4-5) For the repetition of vidyā mantras, etc., or for any other reason, they can stay alone for one or two days in a secluded part of the upāśraya or outside the upāśraya. The use of these vidyā mantras is prohibited in the Āgama for householders, but sadhus and sādhvīs can use them at any time. The practical meaning of these atiśayas is that an ordinary bhikṣu should behave in the following way in these matters: (1) When entering the upāśraya, if necessary, wash your feet outside the upāśraya. (2) If a suitable place is available and there is physical suitability, do not defecate in the upāśraya.  /  (3) In the presence of the guru-prajña or even without being told, they should always strive to perform service tasks. They should engage in svādhyāya, etc., only in the remaining time.  /  (4-5) They should always sleep and eat near the ratnādhika guru or in a place where they can see them.  /  However, a gītartha-bahuśruta bhikṣu can behave according to suitability and according to instructions.  /  The bhāṣya elaborates on these topics, mentioning many virtues and vices, as well as losses and gains.  /  Interested readers should refer to it. The sutra mentions five atiśayas for both the ācārya and the upādhyāya, and the last two atiśayas of the ganavacchedaka are mentioned separately in the second sutra.  /  This means that the first three atiśayas are not necessary for the ganavacchedaka, because the ganavacchedaka position is not a position of wealth but a position of service. Therefore, the last two atiśayas are sufficient for them.  /  In special circumstances, any sadhu or ganavacchedaka can practice all the atiśaya practices. Generally, the ācārya and upādhyāya are prohibited from staying alone in udd. 4. Here, it is a rule rather than an atiśaya.

## Sixth Uddeshak [379 Agitārthas]

**4.** It is not appropriate for many *Agadsuyas* (those who have not memorized the *Achārāṅga* and *Nīśītha* sūtras with their meanings) to reside together in a single-walled, single-gated, single-entrance-exit *upaśraya* (monastery) in a village, town, or capital (or in a *sannīveśa*). If there is a *Prācārāprakalpadhara* (one who has received the *Prācārāprakalpa* vows) among them, they are not subject to *dīkṣāched* (loss of ordination) or *tapa* (penance) as a consequence. If there is no *Prācārāprakalpadhara* among them, they are subject to *dīkṣāched* or *tapa* as a consequence of violating this rule.

**5.** It is not appropriate for many *Agadsuyas* to reside together in a multi-walled, multi-gated, multi-entrance-exit *upaśraya* in a village, town, or capital (or in a *sannīveśa*). If a *Prācārāprakalpadhara* stays with them for three days, they are not subject to *dīkṣāched* or *tapa*. If a *Prācārāprakalpadhara* does not stay with them for three days, all of them are subject to *tapa* or *ched* as a consequence of violating this rule.

**Discussion:** In these sūtras, *Agadsuyas* are referred to as those who have not memorized the *Achārāṅga* and *Nīśītha* sūtras with their meanings. In other words, a *bhikṣu* who has not studied and memorized the necessary texts (such as *Uttara-adhyayana*, *Daśavaikālika*, *Achārāṅga*, and *Nīśītha* sūtras) to become qualified to lead others is called an *Agadsuya*. It is forbidden for one or more such *bhikṣus* to wander about, as stated in the first sūtra of the third *Uddeshak*.

##  Translation:

[380] The Sutra of Conduct has been stated. This Sutra explains that a multi-learned monk should not reside in a village or similar place if there are monks who are not well-versed in the Sutras.  The Sutra clarifies this point by considering the different possibilities of the location of the monastery. If the monastery has only one entrance and exit, then it is not permissible for a "Agadsuyo" (one who is not well-versed in the Sutras) to stay there even for a single day. If the monastery has multiple entrances and exits, then it is permissible for a "Agadsuyo" to stay for one or two days. Staying for a third day would incur penance. The implication is that every eligible monk should study the Sutras worthy of being learned, memorize them, and become fully qualified so that they can wander and participate in assemblies as needed. Because these Sutras explicitly prohibit staying and wandering with those who are not well-versed in the Sutras, and those who violate this rule are considered liable for penance. Therefore, it is the essential duty of every newly ordained eligible monk, as well as their assembly leaders, teachers, and preceptors, to prioritize the study and teaching of the Agamas, not giving precedence to other interests and tendencies. They should focus on becoming and making others proficient in the rules of restraint. No monk should wander alone or engage in other activities without being proficient in the teachings and well-versed in the Sutras.  Detailed information regarding the study of the Sutras, as per the ancient scriptures, is provided in the discussions of Nisitha Udde. 19 and Vyav. Udde. 3 and Udde. 5.  One should carefully study and contemplate this information and make it a primary goal to study and teach the Sutras according to the Agamas. Only by doing so can one truly follow the teachings of the Jinas, and the development of the seeker souls and the Jain religion can be all-encompassing.

**The rules regarding a monk staying alone are as follows:**

6. In a village, city, or assembly with multiple entrances, exits, and pathways, it is not permissible for a multi-learned and well-versed in the Agamas monk to stay alone. How can it be permissible for a monk who is not well-versed in the Sutras and Agamas to stay alone?  It is not permissible.

7. In a village, city, or assembly with a single entrance, exit, and pathway, it is permissible for a multi-learned and well-versed in the Agamas monk to stay alone, for a period of two days, as long as he is mindful of his monkhood. 

Page #201:
---------------------------
[Sixth Objective] [381 7. It is appropriate for a solitary, multi-learned and multi-knowledgeable monk to reside in an *upaśraya* with one *vagḍā*, one door, and one entrance-exit in a village or capital (assembly), while maintaining awareness of restraint at both times. In the previous *sūtradvaya*, a statement was made regarding the residence of *akṛtasūtrī-agītāṛtha* monks, and in the present *sūtradvaya*, a regulation is made for a solitary, multi-learned and multi-knowledgeable monk regarding what kind of *upaśraya* to reside in, in a village or elsewhere, and how to reside. In the *bhāṣya*, while explaining the *sūtras* related to *agītāṛtha* and these solitary monks, they are called *niśrāgat* of the *gaccha*, and a detailed discussion is made by relating the adjectives "one *vagḍā*" etc. to the *upaśrayas*. However, it appears that the word " *uvasśaya* " is missing due to a scribal error in the available copies. Therefore, the meaning and discussion have been done here by including the word " *uvasśaya* ". From the present *sūtradvaya*, it is inferred that: 1. A solitary, multi-learned monk who wanders should not reside in an *upaśraya* with many doors and many paths. 2. However, a multi-learned monk can reside in an *upaśraya* with one door and one path. 3. A solitary monk should reside with the growth of religious sentiment through religious awakening, which strengthens the qualities of detachment and restraint at both times (while sleeping and waking up, or during the day and night). 4. An *alpaśruta* (less learned), *alpa-prāgamjña* (less knowledgeable), *agītāṛtha* monk should not reside alone in any kind of *upaśraya*. It is clear from this *sūtra* or other *bhāgam-vidhāna* that a multi-learned and multi-knowledgeable monk should reside alone, however, the intention of these *sūtras* is to regulate which *upaśraya* to reside in or not, or how to be aware. To understand what kind of faults are likely to occur when a multi-learned and multi-knowledgeable monk resides alone in different types of *upaśrayas*, or when many *agītāṛthas* reside together, the inquisitive should observe the *bhāṣya*. The *prāgamkara* himself has explained some of the same intention in the later *sūtras*. In the *vyavahāra bhāṣya*, the essence of this objective is given in Gujarati language, in which the meaning of these four *sūtras* is also related to the *upaśraya*. It is not appropriate to interpret the meaning related to the village etc., because it is impossible to follow such a regulation in the wandering of those who practice solitary meditation like *pratimādhārī jina-kalpī* etc., and those who practice solitary meditation due to circumstances. Therefore, it is appropriate and in accordance with the *āgama* to interpret the meaning related to the *upaśraya* by considering the meaning explained by the *bhāṣyakāra* as authentic.

## Sixth Objective] [383 To avoid the resolutions of the contaminated tendencies, the monk should also take the following precautions: (1) Not consuming nutritious substances like milk, curd, ghee, sweets, mawa, etc., and also abstaining from nuts like almonds, pistachios, etc. If absolutely necessary, consume these substances in small quantities and avoid continuous consumption for many days. (2) Perform at least four days of Ayambil or fasting penance in a month. (3) Always practice Unodari, i.e., not consuming a full meal at any time. (4) Avoid or minimize food intake in the evening. (5) If health permits, do not consume more than one meal or a maximum of two meals. (6) Minimize the quantity of ingredients in a single meal. (7) Minimize the intake of chili and spices in food, avoid pickles, and other condiments. (8) Avoid fried food. (9) Avoid powdered or sour substances. (10) Avoid chemical medicines or heat-generating medicines. Possibly avoid other medicines as well. (11) Practice Porisi for at least 10-15 days in a month and consume rough or normal food for at least 15 days, i.e., abstain from Vigaya. (12) If food and beverages are extremely hot, cool them down before consuming. Avoid tea and coffee. (13) Avoid close contact with women and refrain from showing interest in their limbs and appearance. (14) Do not sleep during the day. (15) Do not bend over or sleep after meals. (16) Engage in physical activities like walking, begging, etc., or practice penance or standing. (17) Regularly study, read, and contemplate the Uttaradhyayanasutra, Praacharaangasutra, Suyagadangasutra, and Dashavaalikasutra. (18) Regularly perform Bhaktaamarastrot or devotion to the Lord and Pranayama. (19) Engage in self-reflection for a while before sleeping and after waking up. 

Page #204:
---------------------------
## 384] [Vyavahar Sutra (20) When the occasion of anger arises, practice remaining silent and not speaking in a heated manner. (21) Practice self-study, meditation, and Kayotsarga as needed. The Prashnavyakaran Sutra also provides the following information on this subject: A man who follows Brahmacharya should abandon these actions: 

* **Activities that increase attachment to objects, attachment to loved ones, hatred, and delusion:** carelessness, laxity in conduct, massaging oneself with oil, bathing with oil, repeatedly washing the armpits, head, hands, feet, and face, massaging, pressing the feet, etc., foot massage, rubbing, massaging the whole body, applying oil, perfuming the body with fragrant powders, offering incense, adorning the body, making it beautiful, engaging in frivolous activities, grooming nails, hair, and clothes, laughing and joking, speaking in a way that is full of vices, listening to songs and musical instruments, watching the performances of actors, dancers, rope walkers, and wrestlers, and other similar activities that partially or completely destroy austerity, self-restraint, and Brahmacharya. A Brahmachari should abandon all such activities forever.

* **Activities that affect the inner self:** not bathing, not brushing teeth, wearing dirt or other impurities, observing silence, combing hair, forgiveness, control of senses, being naked or wearing minimal clothing, enduring hunger and thirst, having few possessions, enduring cold and heat, sleeping on a wooden bed or on the ground, going to the houses of householders for alms, and accepting or rejecting alms with equanimity, enduring honor, dishonor, and slander, and enduring the pain of bites and stings, acquiring wealth, etc., and affecting the inner self through austerity, fundamental virtues, and humility, which makes the vow of Brahmacharya very strong.

* **All young monks, whether they live in a community or alone, should be very careful about these things.** By living a life guided by these precautions, the possibility of the aforementioned negative situations arising is almost eliminated. The negative tendencies mentioned in the sutras corrupt the health and self-restraint of the monk, and their merit diminishes, leading to a life full of suffering. Therefore, one should practice pure Brahmacharya with all the precautions mentioned.

* **Prohibition of admitting someone from another group into the group:** 10. No Kappi Nigganthaanaa va Nigganthii naa va Niggathi annaganaao aagayam khuyaayaaram, sabalaayaaram, bhinnaayaaram, sankiliththaayaaram tassa thaanas sa analoyaa vetaa apadddikkamaa vetaa, anidaa vetaa, agarahaa vetaa, aviuuttaa vetaa, avisohaa vetaa, akarnaae anabhuttaa vetaa, aharinham paayachchhittam.

[Sixth Uddesaka] [385] It is not permissible for a Nirgrantha or Nirgranthis to reinstate, engage in sexual relations with, or keep company with a Nirgrantha who has come from another gana with a broken, weak, fragmented, or corrupted conduct, until they have been criticized for their transgressions, performed pratikramna, been censured, been subjected to gardha, been expelled, and have been purified, and have made a vow not to repeat the transgression in the future and have accepted the appropriate atonement. It is also not permissible to give them directions or to keep them for a short period of time. 11. It is not permissible for a Nirgrantha or Nirgranthis to reinstate, engage in sexual relations with, or keep company with a Nirgrantha who has come from another gana with a broken, weak, fragmented, or corrupted conduct, until they have been criticized for their transgressions, and have accepted the appropriate atonement. It is also not permissible to give them directions or to keep them for a short period of time. 

Discussion: If a monk or nun leaves their own gana due to a transgression like sexual misconduct, or if they are expelled from their gana, the rules regarding whether or not they can be kept are presented in these sutras. The meaning of terms like "kshata-prachar" is explained in the third Uddesaka. The sutras state that a monk or nun with corrupted conduct should be reinstated, and it is also necessary to purify them through criticism and atonement. Only after they have been purified and reinstated can they be allowed to share food, live together, etc., and only then can they be given instructions by a pracharaya, upadhyaya, or guru. The sutras use the words "disam va anudisam va uddisittae va dhareettae va" to refer to giving instructions from a pracharaya, upadhyaya, or guru. It is not appropriate to interpret these words as meaning that a monk with corrupted conduct can be given the position of pracharaya, etc. because the Agamas state that only a monk with unblemished conduct is worthy of such positions. Therefore, the meaning of giving directions or keeping them for a short period of time should be understood as informing them who their pracharaya, upadhyaya, or pravartiini is. The commentator has also interpreted these words in the same way. 

Page #206:
---------------------------
[386] Due to scribal errors and other reasons, there are variations in the original texts of different manuscripts in place of the two sutras presented in the Vyavahar Sutra. In some places, there are two sutras for Sadhvi, while in others, there are four sutras for Sadhu and Sadhvi. However, based on the commentary, the first sutra is attributed to Sadhvi and the second to Sadhu. The summary of the sixth Uddeshak is as follows:

Sutra 1: One should obtain specific knowledge from the Acharya, etc., before entering the homes of relatives. An Agitārtha or Abahushru Bhikshu should not go alone, but should go with a Gitārtha Bhikshu. Upon reaching the house, one should only take what has been prepared beforehand, but not what has been prepared later. There are five atiśaya (special qualities) related to the conduct of the Acharya-Upadhyaya, and two atiśaya for the Ganavachchedak. An Akrit Sutra (Agitārtha) is not eligible to reside in many places, but due to circumstances, they can stay for one or two nights in an Upashraya. Staying for longer than that makes them liable for Prāyaścitta. A solitary Bhikshu should not stay in an Upashraya with many vagad, doors, or paths, and even in an Upashraya with one vagad, door, or path, they should practice Dharmajagarana at both times. A Bhikshu who engages in sexual intercourse with a woman, even without ejaculation, or who ejaculates due to the effects of hand-job or Kushila-sevan, incurs a Prāyaścitta of Guru-māsik or Guru-chaumāsi respectively.

[10-11] A Sadhu or Sadhvi who has come from another Gachchha and is suffering from Kshata-pāchāra can be accommodated after being fully examined and made to perform Prāyaścitta. One can share food or residence with them, and their Acharya, Upadhyaya, Guru, etc., can be informed.

Conclusion: This Uddeshak discusses the entry into the homes of relatives, the atiśaya of the Acharya, etc., the residence of Gitārtha and Agitārtha Bhikshus, the residence of a solitary Bhikshu, the Prāyaścitta for ejaculation, the accommodation of Sadhus and Sadhvis who have come from another Gachchha and are suffering from Kshata-pāchāra, etc.

## Seventh Uddeshak: Regarding Keeping a Sadhvi from Another Gan

1. **If a Niggantha and Nigganthi are in Sambhoga, it is not permissible for the Nigganthi to keep a Nigganthi from another Gan who has broken or is in a state of broken conduct, without asking the Niggantha, and without criticizing her previous conduct or making her accept the appropriate Prāyaścitta. It is also not permissible to ask her questions, give her Vaachana, re-establish her in the Charitra, eat with her, or keep her company. It is also not permissible to give her directions for a short time, or to hold her.**

2. **If a Nigganthi from another Gan who has broken or is in a state of broken conduct comes to a Niggantha, it is permissible for the Niggantha to ask the Nigganthis, or even without asking, to criticize her previous conduct or make her accept the appropriate Prāyaścitta. It is also permissible to ask her questions, give her Vaachana, re-establish her in the Charitra, allow her to eat with them, and keep her company. It is also permissible to give her directions for a short time, or to hold her. However, if the Nigganthis do not wish to keep her, she should return to her own Gan.**

**Discussion:** The previous Uddeshak dealt with the rules for criticizing and making a Niggantha or Nigganthi with broken conduct accept Prāyaścitta when they come from another Gan. These two Sutras deal specifically with the rules for asking a Sambhogik Shraman or Shramani when a Sadhvi comes from another Gan. If such a Sadhvi comes to a Nigganthi, she can only keep her, give her Vaachana, re-establish her in the Charitra, or eat and sit with her after asking her Sambhogik Sadhus, such as the Acharya and Upadhyaya, and receiving their permission. However, it is not permissible to do any of these things without asking or consulting. 

Page #208:
---------------------------
388] It is not appropriate to give a definitive answer or a व्यवहारसूत्र. If the Acharya etc. are elsewhere, one should wait until their permission is obtained. _ If a Sadhvi comes to the Nirgranthi, i.e., to the Acharya etc., they can make a decision for her by asking the Sadhvis, i.e., the Pravartini, or sometimes they can make a decision without asking and entrust her to the Pratini, and they can also instruct the Acharya, Upadhyaya or Pravartini to take care of her quickly. If, after that, the Pratini is unable to keep her due to some reason like an adverse nature etc., she should be released so that she can go back to her former place on her own. _ It is necessary for the Nirgranthi to ask the Acharya etc. because they can know about her deceit and tricks or the obstacles that may come, and they can also know about her future from her characteristics. If the Pratini does not keep the Sadhvi who has been placed by the Acharya etc., the reason for this could be that she has a friendship or enmity with the former Pravartini, or she may be afraid of some harm from that Sadhvi, etc. Many reasons are explained in detail in the commentary. Generally, one should keep the Sadhvi only after consulting the Pravartini etc. 
3. If a Nirgranthi and a Nirgranthi are Saambhogik, it is not appropriate for the Nirgranthi to stop the Saambhogik behaviour in Paroksha and make her Visambhogik, but it is appropriate to stop the Saambhogik behaviour in Pratyaksha and make her Visambhogik. 

Page #209:
---------------------------
## Seventh Uddeshak [389]

When meeting each other, one should say, "O Prary, I am ending the Sambhogik behavior with you due to such and such reason, and making you Visambhogi." If the other person repents afterwards, it is not permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with them directly and make them Visambhogi. If they do not repent, then it is permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with them directly and make them Visambhogi.

4. For Nirgranthi Nirgranthis who are Sambhogik, it is not permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with the Nirgranthi directly and make them Visambhogi. However, it is permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with them indirectly and make them Visambhogi. When they reach their Acharya or Upadhyaya for service, they should say, "O Bhanta, I want to end the Sambhogik behavior with such and such Arya indirectly due to such and such reason, and make them Visambhogi." If the Nirgranthi repents (of their service-related fault) in the presence of the Acharya-Upadhyaya, then it is not permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with them indirectly and make them Visambhogi. If they do not repent, then it is permissible to end the Sambhogik behavior with them indirectly and make them Visambhogi.

**Discussion:** These two sutras explain the method of ending Sambhogik behavior. If a Bhikshu wants to end their behavior with another Bhikshu, they can tell them to end the behavior by clearly stating the faults. The word "Bhikshu" used in the sutra should be understood as "Acharya" here. Because the Acharya is the disciplinarian of the Gachchha. It is not appropriate to end the behavior with any Sadhu without informing the Acharya. Sadhvis must make a request in the presence of a Sadhu, i.e., in the presence of the Acharya, etc. However, the Acharya, etc., can make any Sadhu-Sadhvi Asambhogik without consulting the Sadhu-Sadhvis. Bhikshus should tell the Acharya, etc., in the presence of the Sadhus who are to be made Visambhogi, and Sadhvis should tell the Acharya, etc., in the absence of the Sadhvis who are to be made Visambhogi. Then they should inquire from them. This is the meaning of the direct and indirect Visambhog mentioned in both sutras. After such a request, if the faulty Sadhu or Sadhvi repents of their faults and adopts simplicity and humility, then they can be given Prāyaścitta and their relationship can be maintained. If they do not repent, then the relationship is severed. The reasons for ending Sambhog are mentioned in the Thananga Sutra, Chapter 3 and Chapter 9, and many such reasons are also mentioned in the Bhashya. Their essence is that: 1. Neglecting the Mahavrata, Samiti, Gupti, and Samachari, and the fourth... 

Page #210:
---------------------------
[390] A *Nigganthi* (Jain monk) is to be disassociated from a *Sadhu* or *Sadhvi* (Jain ascetic) if they: 1. repeatedly accuse them, 2. repeatedly associate with them in a way that is inappropriate for their stage of spiritual development, or 3. show opposition towards their *Guru* (spiritual teacher) or other respected figures.

**Regarding the rules for initiating someone into the order:**

5. It is not permissible for a *Nigganthi* to initiate another *Nigganthi* into the order for their own benefit, by: ordaining them, shaving their head, educating them, re-establishing them in their vows, living with them, sharing meals with them, giving them directions for a long period of time, or giving them directions for a short period of time in the direction of the wind or against the direction of the wind.

6. It is permissible for a *Nigganthi* to initiate another *Nigganthi* into the order for the benefit of another, by: ordaining them, up to and including sharing meals with them, giving them directions for a long period of time, or giving them directions for a short period of time in the direction of the wind or against the direction of the wind.

7. It is not permissible for a *Nigganthi* to initiate another *Nigganthi* into the order for their own benefit, by: ordaining them, up to and including sharing meals with them, giving them directions for a long period of time, or giving them directions for a short period of time in the direction of the wind or against the direction of the wind.

8. It is permissible for a *Nigganthi* to initiate another *Nigganthi* into the order for the benefit of another, by: ordaining them, up to and including sharing meals with them, giving them directions for a long period of time, or giving them directions for a short period of time in the direction of the wind or against the direction of the wind.

**Discussion:**

Generally, the initiation of a *Sadhu* is performed by a *Pracharaya* (head of a monastic order) or *Upadhyaya* (teacher), and the initiation of a *Sadhvi* is performed by a *Pracharaya*, *Upadhyaya*, or *Pravarti* (female teacher). However, a *Geetarth* *Sadhu* (a *Sadhu* who has attained a high level of spiritual understanding) can initiate any *Sadhu* or *Sadhvi*.

Any Sadhvi can initiate any Sadhu or Sadhvi into the order, but they must take the permission of the Acharya. If a Sadhu is to be initiated, it can be done by the Acharya, Upadhyaya, or Pravarti. If a Sadhvi is to be initiated, it can be done by the Acharya, Upadhyaya, or Pravarti. However, a Sadhu cannot initiate a Sadhvi for themselves, and a Sadhvi cannot initiate a Sadhu for themselves.

The commentary explains that initiating each other in this way can lead to various doubts among the general public, which can harm the Sadhu, Sadhvi, or even the Jain religion.

**Difficult words:**

* **Pavvavetae:** To initiate
* **Mundavetae:** To shave the head

* **Uvadavetae:** To give the great initiation
* **Sambu Jittae:** To give food and other necessities
* **Sanvasittae:** To keep company
* **Itteriyan:** Short-term
* **Disan:** Acharya
* **Anudisam:** Upadhyaya and Pravarti
* **Uddisittae:** To give instructions for the Nishra

**Regarding the instructions of a Guru who is in a distant area:**

* **9. No Kappi Nigganthinam Viikittiyam Disam Va Anuvisam Va Uddisittae Va Dharettae Va:** It is not permissible for a Niggantha to accept instructions from a distant Pravarti or Guru.
* **10. Kappi Nigganthanam Viikittiyam Disam Va Anuvisam Va Uddisittae Va Dharettae Va:** It is permissible for a Niggantha to accept instructions from a distant Acharya or Guru.

**Discussion:**

The previous Sutra discussed the rules for initiating others, and this Sutra provides some specific rules on the same topic. 

Page #212:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

[392] It is not permissible for a Sadhvi to be initiated by a Guru who resides very far away, even if she is instructed to do so by someone from that area. This is because she cannot travel alone, and due to the long distance, no one can accompany her. There is a possibility of many doubts, anxieties, and afflictions arising during the long journey, especially if her Guru falls ill or passes away. For these reasons, it is forbidden for a Sadhvi to be initiated by a Guru who resides very far away. Similarly, it is not permissible for a common monk to be initiated by an Acharya or Guru who resides far away. This is because the same potential problems that apply to a Sadhvi can also arise for a monk. However, the second Sutra provides an exception, which is explained in the Bhashya. It states that if the monk to be initiated is completely healthy, knowledgeable, and committed to the Dharma, and his Acharya is also similarly committed, then he can be initiated by someone in a distant area. The Bhashya states that such a monk, even if he travels alone, will not be susceptible to the aforementioned vices like Mithyatva (false belief), etc. Therefore, he can be initiated by a distant Acharya or Upadhyaya. Here, the meaning of "Disam-Anudisam" is misinterpreted to refer to travel. This should be understood as a misinterpretation.

**Methods for Resolving Disputes**

11. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas to reconcile or apologize while they are in separate locations.

12. It is permissible for Nirgranthas to reconcile or apologize even while they are in separate locations.

**Discussion:**

The Brihatkalpa (U. 4) prohibits Sadhus and Sadhvis from engaging in activities like traveling without first apologizing for any conflict. However, if one of them leaves for a distant land due to unresolved conflict, and later, either spontaneously or through someone's influence, the feeling of apologizing arises in their mind, then the Sadhvi should be allowed to apologize even if she is in a very distant location. 

Page #213:
---------------------------
[Seventh Uddeshak] [393 One should not go but should send a message of apology with another monk who is going, but the monk should go to the place and apologize. / The reason for this separate rule should be understood as stated in the previous sutra, that the Sadhvi's going is dependent on others and the Sadhu's going alone is also possible. If the area is nearby, the Sadhvi should also go there with other Sadhvis and apologize. / The rule stated in the sutra is with respect to a distant area. It is explained in the commentary that if there is a war of kings, famine, etc. in the middle areas, then the monk should also apologize if he is staying in a very distant area. Apology is so important in religious life that if one does not feel apologetic and dies in such a state, then he becomes a Viradhak. / It is of two types, based on substance and feeling - (1) If there is a feeling of anger or resentment towards someone, then say directly to him - "I forgive you and I am happy with you." If someone is angry due to someone's mistake, then say to him - 'I made a mistake, please forgive me, I will not behave like this again'. (2) From feeling - make the heart completely pure with peace, simplicity and humility. Apologizing and asking for forgiveness with such behavior and with purity of feelings and purity of heart is the complete process of apology. / If it is not possible due to circumstances, then according to Brih. U. 1 Su. 34, one can also achieve worship by calming oneself completely, but if there is no peace and purity in the heart, then even after external rituals like Sanlekhana, 15 days of Santhara and apology, worship cannot be achieved, this is clear from the description of Abhicikumar in Bhagavati Sutra. The law of study for Nirgranth-Nirgranthis in difficult times 13. No Kappa Nigganthanam Viigithe Kale Sajjhayam Karetae. 14. Kappae Nigganthoonam Viigithe Kale Sajjhayam Karetae Nigganthnisaae / 13. It is not appropriate for Nirgranths to study (the study of Kalik Agam in the study period of Utkalik Agam) in difficult times. 14. It is appropriate for Nirgranths to study in difficult times under the protection of a Nirgranth. / Discussion - The time in which the study of Agams is prohibited is called Vyatikrisht Kal for those Agams. Sadhu-Sadhvi should not recite the original text of Agam at such a time! Those times are mentioned in many ways in Nisith Uddeshak 19. 

Page #214:
---------------------------
In the present chapter of the Vyavahar Sutra, only the second and third praharas of the day and night should be understood as the Vyatikrushta Kala, meaning that the study of the Kalik Sutra is prohibited during these four praharas. The Nandi Sutra states that the number of Kalik Sutras is 12 + 30 = 42, and the number of Utkalik Sutras is 29. The Anuyogadwar Sutra refers to the Aavashyak Sutra as Utkalik. Thus, a total of 42 + 30 = 72 Agam Shrutajnana are mentioned. The study of the available Kalik Sutras in the Utkal is prohibited in the first Sutra, but the second Sutra provides an exception for Sadhvis to study near Nirgranthas. The reason for this is that sometimes, it becomes necessary for Pravartinis or Sadhvis to listen to the original text from Upadhyayas, etc., so that the tradition of the original text remains consistent among other Sadhus and Sadhvis. The time for mutual study and recitation of Agams by Sadhus and Sadhvis is suitable only in the second and third praharas, hence this concession is given, it should be understood. The study of Utkalik Sutras in the four Sandhyakalas is also prohibited, therefore, the study of Dashakalik or Nandi Sutra cannot be done in the Sandhyakalas or at noon. In some traditions, the study of fifty gathas of the Nandi Sutra and two chulikas of the Dashavaikalik is done even during the time of Asvadhyay. Regarding this, it is believed that these compositions are not original. They have been added by someone other than the author. But this belief is erroneous and inappropriate, because the author of the Nandi Sutra is Devvachak Shri Devadhiggani Kshamasraman, this is undisputed. Devvachak is his epithet. The charnikar and tikaakar of the Nandi Sutra have accepted Devvachak or Devadhiggani as the author of the Nandi Sutra. Even in the 50 gathas of Nandi, at the end, Dushyagani is praised by bowing to him. Therefore, Devvachak Shri Devadhiggani, the disciple of Dushyagani, is the author of the Sutra. In the last verse of the last verse, it is said, "Naanas paruvaan vochch" = Now I will describe the form of knowledge. This also makes it clear that the author of Nandi is also the author of the 50 gathas. Therefore, it is not evidence-based to consider the 50 gathas as being added by someone other than the author of the Sutra, and it is completely inappropriate to study or recite the 50 gathas of the Nandi Sutra in the Sandhyakalas or during the time of Asvadhyay. Regarding the chulikas of the Dashavaikalik Sutra, there is a fictional story or legend that "these chulikas were brought by the sister of Sthuli Bhadra from the Mahavideha region." But the authenticity of this story is also doubtful. Because some texts mention the bringing of two chulikas, while others mention the bringing of four chulikas. -~-Parishista Parva, Parva 9, Aav. Chu. Page 188 

Page #215:
---------------------------
[Seventh Uddeshak] [395 From these texts, the Churni of the Dasha Vaikalik Sutra is also ancient / Its author, Shri Agastya Singh Suri, while explaining the Chulika, has clearly stated that "Now, further, the Sutrakar Shri Shayambhavacharya says thus." The Churnikar Shri Agastya Singh Suri has fully explained both the Chulikaas and has affirmed that they were composed by Shayambhavacharya. But he has not made any statement about their being brought from Mahavideha. For proof, see Chulika. 2 Ga. 14-15 Churni p. 265 / Therefore, this legend has been propagated by someone after the Churnikar for some reason. It has been written in later texts / Therefore, it is completely inappropriate to consider these two Chulikaas as connected by anyone and to study them during Sandhyasamaya or Asvadhyaya time / Doing so will also lead to Prāyaścitta according to Nishītha U. 19. The method of studying Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis is as follows: 15. No Kappi Nigganthaan va Nigganthoon va Asajjhaie Sajjhaayam Karettae / 16. Kappi Nigganthaan va Nigganthiin va Sajmaie Sajjhaayam Karettae / 15. It is not appropriate for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to study during Asvadhyaya time / 16. It is appropriate for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to study during Svādhyāya time. Asvadhyaya related to discussion time 12, Asvadhyaya related to Praudarik 10 and Asvadhyaya related to Akash 10, thus a total of 32 Asvadhyayas are prohibited from studying in the present Sutra and in the previous Sutra, studying during the time of Utkal (second and third Prahar) of Kalik Sutras is prohibited / For detailed discussion on Asvadhyaya, one should study Nishītha Uddeshak, 19. In the other Sutra, it is stated that if there is no Asvadhyaya of any kind, then Sadhusadhvis should study. From the description of the excesses of knowledge and from the Prāyaścitta provision of Nishītha Uddeshak. 19 Sutra 13 and from the third chapter of Shraman Sutra, it becomes clear that Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis must study during Svādhyāya time. To fulfill this Svādhyāya provision, in some tradition, the study of seventeen verses of Dasha Vaikalik is done along with Pratikraman, this tradition is inappropriate. Because the time of Pratikraman is Asvadhyaya, therefore, studying along with it is also against Shraagam and it is also necessary to study many Kalik Vagams like Acharang Nishītha Sutra etc. which are memorized. 

Page #216:
---------------------------
##  396] [Vyavahar Sutra] Therefore, after the completion of the evening Pratikraman, one should engage in Swadhyay for the entire Prahar after transcribing the time (sky). Similarly, it should be understood that the Agam Vidhan is to engage in Swadhyay in the fourth Prahar of the night before taking the permission for the morning Pratikraman. However, it is an inappropriate tradition to be satisfied by engaging in Swadhyay only of those 17 Gathas of the Dasavai during the time of Aswadhyay. Not engaging in Swadhyay in all four Prahar is an excess of knowledge and is a place for the Laghu Chaumasi Pratikshepa. Knowing this, if Swadhyay is not done at any time, one should accept its Pratikshepa. However, if time has been spent in service or Guru Prajna, then there is no Pratikshepa even if Swadhyay is not done in all four Prahar. Similarly, other exceptional reasons such as illness should be understood. Spending time in Vikathas while expecting Swadhyay without reason is contrary to the conduct of Samyam Maryada and is the consumption of excess knowledge.

**17. No Kappi Nigganthan Va Nigganthiin Va Appano Asajjhaie Sajshayam Karetae / Kappian Annam Annass Vaayan Dalitae / 17. It is not appropriate for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to engage in Swadhyay when they have Aswadhyay related to their own body, but it is appropriate to give each other Vaachana.**

**Discussion:** The general prohibition of engaging in Swadhyay during the ten Audarik Aswadhyay is mentioned in Sutra 16. However, the reason for prohibiting it again here is that the Aswadhyay related to menstruation or other wounds continues, and it is not appropriate to stop or interrupt any ongoing Vaachana of the Sutra during that time. If there is a collective Vaachana of many Sadhus and Sadhvis, then the reason for Aswadhyay may be for one person at one time and for another person at another time. In this way, many days can pass and it can lead to disorder in the Vaachana of the Sutras. Therefore, this Sutra makes an exceptional provision in the case of the aforementioned Aswadhyay related to menstruation and other wounds, stating that Sadhus and Sadhvis can exchange Vaachana with each other after properly considering the blood, pus, etc. In this way, clear permission is given here to give and receive Vaachana during the Aswadhyay of menstruation. However, engaging in self-Swadhyay or listening to it is prohibited by the previous part of the Sutra. The Bhashyakar and Tikakar, while explaining this Sutra, have explained in detail the method of giving and receiving Vaachana during the time of menstruation and in the case of wounds, etc. They have also mentioned the Pratikshepa for engaging in Swadhyay and for giving and receiving Vaachana according to the method. For more information, see the discussion of Sutra 15 in Nisheeth Udde. 19. Although the Sutra states the provision of giving Vaachana during one's own Aswadhyay, it should be understood that both giving and receiving Vaachana are included. Because the disorder that is possible in not giving Vaachana is even greater...

---------------------------
[Seventh Uddeshak] [397] It is more difficult to pronounce than to listen in one's own asvadhyaya, and there is a lack of order in not taking the recitation. Therefore, taking the recitation is self-evident in the permission to give the recitation. Nevertheless, one should definitely pay attention to following the method of purifying the blood, etc., of the speaker and applying the cloth patch. The need for the appointment of an Acharya-Upadhyaya for a Nirgranthi 18. Thirty years of Shramanaparyaya Nirgranthi should accept a three-year Shramanaparyaya Nirgranthi as Upadhyaya. 19. Sixty years of Shramanaparyaya Nirgranthi should accept a five-year Shramanaparyaya Nirgranthi as Acharya or Upadhyaya. Discussion-Uddeshak 3 Sutra 11-12 states that it is necessary for Sadhvis to stay under the protection of these three: Acharya, Upadhyaya and Pravartini, and it is necessary for Sadhus to stay under the protection of these two: Acharya, Upadhyaya. This provision is made for Sadhus and Sadhvis who are up to forty years old and have three years of Dikshaparaya. In the present Sutra, it is said that a Sadhvi with thirty years of Dikshaparaya should be appointed as Upadhyaya and a Sadhvi with sixty years of Dikshaparaya should be appointed as Acharya. This means that it is not permissible for Sadhvis with up to thirty years of Dikshaparaya to remain without Upadhyaya and Pravartini, and it is not permissible for Sadhvis with up to sixty years of Dikshaparaya to remain without Acharya. In the Bhashya and Tika, it is explained that by adding ten years before Diksha to the above number of years, Sadhvis up to forty years of age should not remain without the protection of Upadhyaya and Pravartini, and Sadhvis up to seventy years of age should not remain without the protection of Acharya. After the above number of years, if the degree holder attains Kaladharma or becomes a lax practitioner by leaving the Gachchha, then it is not necessary to appoint Acharya etc. for such Sadhvis. In the Bhashya, Sadhvis are compared to 'Lata' i.e. just as Lata remains only with the support of trees, similarly, it is necessary for Sadhvis to remain under the Acharya for the protection of Samyamsamadhi. 

Page #218:
---------------------------
[398] In the *Vyavahar Sutra Brihatkalpa Uddesa 1*, it is stated that when staying in a village or any other place, they should only stay with the assurance of protection and assistance from the householder, etc. From the perspective of the *Agamas*, it is not necessary for the *Sadhvis* to have a *Pracharya* after 60 years of *diksha* or an *Upadhyaya* after 30 years of *diksha*. The detailed description of the appointment of a *Bhikshu* with three years of *diksha* to the position of *Upadhyaya* and a *Bhikshu* with five years of *diksha* to the position of *Pracharya* should be known from the third *Uddesaka*. The method of disposing of the dead body of a *Shraman* and accepting their equipment is as follows:

**20.** If a *Bhikshu* dies while traveling from village to village and another *Bhikshu* sees his body and knows that there are no householders nearby, then it is appropriate to dispose of the body of the deceased *Shraman* in a secluded, lifeless place after performing the rituals of *pratilekhan* and *pramardjan*. If any of the deceased *Shraman's* equipment is usable, then it is appropriate to accept them as *sagarkrit* and use them again after obtaining the permission of the *Acharya*, etc.

**Discussion:** In the *Brihatkalpa Uddesaka 4*, the method of disposing of a *Sadhu* who has attained *kaladharma* in an *upashraya* is mentioned. In the present *sutra*, the method of disposing of the body of a *Bhikshu* who has attained *kaladharma* while traveling is described. If a *Bhikshu* traveling alone attains *kaladharma* and one or more *Sarmic* *Sadhus* see his body, then they should take it to a secluded place and dispose of it according to the proper procedure. "**Ma Sagariy**" - The *Bhikshu* should know that there are no householders nearby who would perform the funeral rites. In this situation, the *Sadhus* should take the body to a secluded, lifeless place and dispose of it. If the deceased *Bhikshu* has any usable equipment, then they can accept it after obtaining the permission of the *Pracharya*. They can then keep and use the equipment that the *Pracharya* allows them to keep. If one or more *Bhikshus* leave the body of the deceased *Bhikshu* on the road for any reason, then they are all liable for the *Guruchaumasi* atonement.

**Regarding the decision of avoiding a Shayyaatar:**

21. If the Shayyaatar (landlord) rents out the dwelling and tells the tenant, "Shraman Nirgranth are staying in this place," then the landlord is a Sagarik (Shayyaatar) and therefore, it is not appropriate to take food etc. from his house. If the Shayyaatar does not say anything, but the tenant says so, then he is a Shayyaatar and therefore, should be avoided. If both the landlord and the tenant say so, then both are Shayyaatar and therefore, both should be avoided.

22. If the Shayyaatar sells the dwelling and tells the buyer, "Shraman Nirgranth are staying in this place," then he is a Shayyaatar and therefore, should be avoided. If the seller does not say anything, but the buyer says so, then he is a Sagarik and therefore, should be avoided. If both the seller and the buyer say so, then both are Sagarik and therefore, both should be avoided.

**Discussion:** This sutra clarifies who is considered a Shayyaatar when a monk stays in a house that is either rented or sold. If the buyer or the tenant allows the monk to stay in their house willingly, then they are considered a Shayyaatar. If they are indifferent towards the monk staying there and do not give permission, but the previous owner of the house allows the monk to stay, then... 

Page #220:
---------------------------
[400] The *Vyavahar Sutra* explains that "the monk will stay for a certain time, after which that place will also become yours." In such a situation, the former *shayyadata* remains the *shayyatar*. The meaning of the *shayyatar* decision is that the food, etc., of the house of the one who will be the *shayyatar* will be called *shayyatarpind*. If the former *shayyadata* also says, "I have the authority," and the new *swami* also says, "I also have the authority," then both should be considered *shayyatar*. If they understand upon explanation, then it is appropriate to follow the authority of only one. Because in *Brihatkalpa* U. 2 Su. 13, the rule of taking the authority of one *swami* in a house with many *swamis* is given. For specific information regarding *shayyatar* and *shayyatarpind*, see the discussion in *Nishith* U. 2 Su. 46. In the *sutra*, the word *upashraya* is used for the house of the householder. The reason for this is that both the houses where the monk is staying or where he is to stay are called *upashraya* by the *Agam* scriptures. Therefore, in *Brihatkalpa* Udd. 2 Su. 1-10, the house of the householder where water pots, *sura* or *sauvira* pots, and grains and food items are kept is also called *upashraya*. Due to the same method, here also the house of the householder is called *upashraya* because the monk is already staying there. In the present social *upashraya*, it is not possible to sell or rent a place where a *sadhu* is staying. Therefore, here the word *upashraya* should be understood as the house of the householder. The method of taking authority: 23. *Vihavadhūyā nāyakulavāsinī sā vi yāvi progghaṁ aṇunnaveyyamvā, kimang puṇ piyā vā, bhāyā vā, putte vā, se vi yā vi ogghahe progevvhiagve* / 24. *Pahevi progghaṁ aṇunnaveyyavve* / 23. The authority of a widowed girl living in her father's house can also be taken, then what to say of the father, brother, son, i.e., their authority can also be taken. 24. If one has to stay on the way, then the authority of that place should also be taken. Discussion: The subject matter of the first *sutra* is which members of the household can be taken authority from, and the subject matter of the second *sutra* is that one should sit only after taking authority at any place. The first *sutra* states that the authority of the father, son, brother can also be taken, i.e., any sensible member of the joint family, whether male or female, can be taken authority from. Authority cannot be taken from a married girl. But the girl who, for any reason, always stays with her father...

## Seventh Uddeshak

[401] If you are staying in the same house, you can take permission from the owner. Similarly, if there is a wise and responsible servant, you can take permission from them. If you are sitting in an open space outside the house (veranda, etc.) and the owner has locked the house and gone somewhere, you can take permission from a passerby or a neighbor. According to the second Sutra, if a monk has to stay on the way or under a tree while wandering, they should also take permission for that place. A monk cannot sit there without permission. At that time, if any traveler is passing by or any person is sitting there, their permission can be taken. If there is no one to give permission, the monk can stay there by saying, "This is the permission of Shakendra." But in no way should one stay anywhere without taking permission, this is the meaning of the second Sutra. If one forgets to take permission, they should do Pratikraman for that. In the manuscripts, there are two types of words "Phae Vi" and "Pahiye Vi". But according to the Bhashya, the reading "Phae Vi" is correct here, which means that if you have to sit on the path, i.e., on the way, you should also take permission. The use of "Pahiye Vi" should be considered a scribal error.

The rule for taking permission in the case of a change of government is as follows:

25. If a new king is crowned after the death of the king, but the kingdom remains undivided and unattacked by enemies, the royal lineage remains unbroken, and the administration remains the same, then the previous permission remains valid for the monks and nuns.

26. If a new king is crowned after the death of the king, and at that time the kingdom is divided or attacked by enemies, the royal lineage is broken, or the administration changes, then the monks and nuns should take permission again for the sake of their monkhood, i.e., (the limits of restraint).

**Discussion:** The monks should take permission from the owner of the kingdom, i.e., the king, etc., where they want to wander. After taking permission, if the king changes, there are two situations: 

Page #222:
---------------------------
##  402] [Vyavahar Sutra (1) If the prince or descendant of the former king becomes the king, or only the person changes, but there is no change in the other royal authority, system, and laws, then one can wander with the previous permission, there is no need to seek permission again. (2) If a completely new king is made, and the state system has changed, then it becomes necessary to seek permission again to wander there. If the royal permission for wandering of all the Sadhus and Sadhvis of all the Jain Sanghas is obtained by one prominent person, then there is no need for any individual Sant-Sati to seek permission separately. Sutra 1-2 3-4 The summary of the seventh Uddeshak is that a Nirgranthi with contaminated practices from another Gachchha cannot be kept by Pravartini etc. Sadhvis without asking the Acharya etc. and without purifying her faults, but the Acharya etc. can keep her in the Gachchha even without asking the Pravartini etc. Sadhvis after purifying her faults. If a Sadhu-Sadhvi repeatedly commits the fault of Eshanadosha more than three times by neglecting, or breaks the rules, then the food relationship with that Sadhu-Sadhvi can be abandoned. Sadhvis cannot directly talk about this, but Sadhus can talk directly. A Sadhu can sometimes give Diksha to a Sadhvi, and a Sadhvi can sometimes give Diksha to a Sadhu, but they can do it under the protection of Acharya etc., not under their own protection. A Sadhvi should not accept Diksha under the protection of a very distant Acharya or Pravartini, but should accept the protection of a nearby Acharya or Pravartini. A Sadhu can accept Diksha even under the protection of a distant Acharya. Another Sadhvi can apologize to a Sadhvi who has gone very far, but a Sadhu needs to meet directly to apologize. / In the Bhashya, it is said that a Sadhu should also apologize from a distance in certain circumstances. One should not study the Kalik Sutra in the Utkal (second or third watch), but a Sadhvi can sometimes recite the study to the Upadhyaya etc. One should not study when there are thirty-two types of Asvadhyaya times, but one should definitely study when there is no Asvadhyaya. / One should not study in one's own physical Asvadhyaya, but Sadhus and Sadhvis can recite the Sutra-artha to each other. 9-10 11-12 13-14 15-16 

Page #223:
---------------------------
## Seventh Uddeshak

**18-19, 20** [403] Sadhvis with a dikshaparaya of 30 years or less should not stay without an Upadhyaya Pravartini, and Sadhvis with a dikshaparaya of 60 years or less should not stay without an Acharya. If a dead body of a Sadhu is found on the path while traveling, it should be disposed of properly and in a suitable place. If they have useful equipment, they can be taken and used with the permission of the Pracharaya. If they want to sell or rent the Shayyatar house, they can take the permission of the new Swami, the previous Swami, or both. They can also stay with the permission of a family member or a responsible servant. The permission of a married daughter who always stays at her father's house can also be taken. If they want to sit on the path, they should also sit with permission. If the king or the state system changes, it is necessary to take permission again to travel in that state. If the prince or other descendants of the same king become king, they can travel with the previous permission.

**21-22, 23, 24, 25-26**

**Upasangar Sutra 1-2, 5-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-17, 18-19, 20, 21-24, 25-26**

This Uddeshak describes the following topics: accepting a Sadhvi from another Gachchha into the Gachchha, mutual Sambhogavichched, mutual Diksha, taking Nishra from a distant Pracharaya, etc., seeking forgiveness from a distant person or not, doing Swadhyaya or not, accepting Pracharaya and Upadhyaya by a Sadhvi, disposing of the dead body of a Sadhu, taking permission for places to stay, taking new permission to travel in a state, etc.

---------------------------
The eighth objective is the method of accepting a sleeping place. 1. The verse says, "Whatever bed or bedding is available, let it be mine." If the Thera (senior monk) permits, then it is acceptable. If the Thera does not permit, then it is not acceptable. Thus, the acceptance of a bed or bedding is dependent on the Thera's permission. 1. If one has stayed in a house during the winter or summer, then one should accept whatever suitable place or bedding is available in that house. If such a resolution is made, and the Thera gives permission for that place, then it is acceptable to use the bed or bedding. If the Thera does not give permission, then it is not acceptable to use the bed or bedding. If the Thera does not give permission, then it is acceptable to accept the bed or bedding in the order of seniority (from the highest to the lowest) according to the order of initiation. Discussion: When staying in a house or shelter, one should decide on the place to sit or sleep with the permission of the Guru or the head. This ensures proper order and discipline. The Acharanga Sutra (2.2.3) states the method of accepting a sleeping place (bedding) by saying that "after giving suitable places to the Acharya, Upadhyaya, and other holders of such positions, as well as to the young, old, sick, newly initiated, and guests (visitors), the remaining monks should accept sleeping places in the order of their discipline." The commentary elaborates on the proper order of the Acharya, etc., and the conditions of the bed, such as even-uneven, with or without a pillow. The Pracharya Sutra (2.2.3) instructs on remaining equanimous in various types of suitable and unsuitable beds. The Uttaradhyayanasutra (2.2) states that a monk should consider what will happen in one night and bear that situation with equanimity. The Brihadkatha (3) also prescribes the acceptance of bed and bedding in the order of seniority, which is a rule of renunciation, as it is not necessary to follow it in cases of illness, etc.

## Eighth Objective

**(1) Gāha -** House, dwelling, residence. 
**(2) Uū -** Hemant (winter) and Grishma (summer) seasons.
**(3) Pajjosavie -** A monk who has arrived or stayed in a house or residence.
**(4) Tāe Gāhāe -** In that house.
**(5) Tāe Paesāe -** In a particular section or room of that house.
**(6) Tāe Uvāsantarāe -** In a specific limited space within that room or section.

**Method of Bringing Bedding:**

**2.** A monk should seek bedding that is as light as possible, so light that it can be carried in one hand. Such bedding can be sought from the same village for one, two, or three days, with the intention that it will be used during the Hemant or Grishma seasons.

**3.** A monk should seek bedding that is as light as possible, so light that it can be carried in one hand. Such bedding can be sought from the same village or a nearby village for one, two, or three days, with the intention that it will be used during the Varshavas (rainy season).

**4.** A monk should seek bedding that is as light as possible, so light that it can be carried in one hand. Such bedding can be sought from the same village or a distant village for one, two, three, four, or five days, with the intention that it will be used during the Buddhavās (old age).

**Discussion:**

The previous sutra discussed the method of taking possession of a place using the term "bedding," while these sutras describe the method of obtaining things like cloth. 

Page #226:
---------------------------
[406] The Pat and other things are accepted only as a matter of convenience and only when needed, because it is not a general requirement for a Sadhu. The commentary mentions the atonement for accepting Pat etc. during the Hemant season due to unnecessary circumstances and calls the one who does not accept it during the rainy season as deserving of atonement. These commentary provisions show the main expectation of life preservation and physical peace. Therefore, the monk should decide to accept or not accept Pat etc. wisely, keeping those expectations in mind. These sutras state that whatever Pat etc. is brought should be so light that it can be lifted with one hand. The search for the necessary Pat etc. for the Hemant-summer season can be done in the same village for three days, for the rainy season it can be done in the same village or in another nearby village for three days, and for the permanent residence, the search for Pat etc. can be done in the same village for five days or even in a distant village. This is clearly stated in these three separate sutras. The first sutra does not have the word "addhanam", the second sutra has "pradhanam" and the third sutra has the word "duram avi pradhanam", which is why there is some difference in the meaning of the three sutras. See Ni. U. 2 and Uddeshak 5 for further discussion of the bed-cover. See 5. Theranam Therabhumipattanam Kappi Dandaye Va, Bhandaye Va, Chhataye Va, Mattae Va, Latthia Va, Bhishe Va, Chele Va, Chelchilimili Ba, Chamme Va, Chammakose Va, Chammapalichcheyane Va Avirahiye Ovase Thavetta Gahavaikulam Pindavayapdiaye Pavisittae Va, Nikkhamittae Va / Kappi Nan Sanniyattacharinan Dochchampi Uggaham Anunnavetta Pariharittae / 5. It is permissible for a monk who has attained the status of a monk (alone) to go to a householder's house for food, keeping his staff, vessel, umbrella, mat, stick, wooden seat, cloth, cloth-chilimili, leather, leather bag and leather cover in a place where there is no one to take care of them. It is permissible to take them again after returning from begging, with the permission of the person who was looking after them. This sutra describes a monk who wanders alone, who is a solitary dweller as described in Pracha. Shru. 1 A. 6 U. 2, Suy. Shru. 1 A. 10, Uttara. A. 32 Ga. 5 and Dashavan. Chu. 2 Ga. 10. He is also old or approaching old age, a monk who is eligible for the status of a monk, a general monk, and due to karmic association, he is living alone even in old age, observing restraint as much as possible.

## Eighth Objective [407]

Due to physical reasons, he has to keep many auxiliary instruments. He cannot go for begging or other activities carrying all those instruments. If he finds an unsafe place to stay, leaving those instruments there, children or dogs might break them or take them away, or thieves might steal them. Due to such reasons, the sutra states that the elderly monk should appoint someone to protect his instruments or inform someone sitting nearby before leaving and inform them again upon returning, saying "I have arrived." Only then should he take his instruments.

The exceptions stated in this sutra for an elderly monk who is physically compelled to be alone, clearly show the extremely liberal and anekanta vision of the sutra author or Jainism. The elderly monk mentioned in the sutra carries a staff or stick for support while walking, an umbrella for protection from heat, etc., and keeps many containers due to ailments like stool, urine, phlegm, etc. He also keeps earthen pots and other vessels, extra clothes and utensils, a mosquito net, a straw or wooden seat for support while sitting, leather pieces, leather bags (upanaha, shoes, etc.) or leather cutters, i.e., he keeps any instrument that is necessary for his use.

The sutra states this rule for those instruments that are not needed while going for begging. Padma-dhari or Jina-kalpi monks who have specific practices do not use auxiliary instruments, and such a situation mentioned in the sutra is not possible for a Gachchhagat monk. Because there are many people in the Gachchha who perform various activities. Therefore, it is clear from this sutra that even a common Bahushruta monk, due to circumstances, can live alone for life and follow the rules of restraint as much as possible.

The rule of taking permission again for the bed-maker is as follows:

6. It is not permissible for a monk, a nun, a Padhariya, a Sagariya, or a bed-maker to take any instrument without informing them.

7. It is permissible for a monk, a nun, a Padhariya, a Sagariya, or a bed-maker to take any instrument after informing them.

8. It is not permissible for a monk, a nun, a Padhariya, a Sagariya, or a bed-maker to take any instrument without informing them, even if it is small.

9. It is permissible for a monk, a nun, a Padhariya, a Sagariya, or a bed-maker to take any instrument after informing them, even if it is small.

##  Translation:

**408]** 

**6.** It is not proper to take a *pratiharic* bed-spread or bed-spread of a non-Jain householder, brought from outside, to another place without seeking permission a second time. 

**7.** It is proper to take a *pratiharic* bed-spread or bed-spread of a non-Jain householder, brought from outside, to another place only after seeking permission a second time.

**8.** It is not proper to use a *pratiharic* bed-spread or bed-spread of a non-Jain householder, brought from outside, after it has been completely handed over, without seeking permission a second time.

**9.** It is proper to use a *pratiharic* bed-spread or bed-spread of a non-Jain householder, brought from outside, after it has been completely handed over, only after seeking permission a second time.

**Discussion:** If it becomes necessary to take any *pratiharic* equipment, such as a bed-spread or other household items, from the house where it was received to another house, it is necessary to obtain permission from its owner or inform him. For more information, see the discussion of *Ni. U. 2 Su. 53*. If any equipment, such as a *paṭa* (cloth), has been brought, it can be left in the *upaśraya* (shelter) under one's own care if it is not needed for a short period of time. However, if it becomes necessary to take it back again, it is necessary to seek permission again. This is the meaning of the second *sūtra*. For more information, see the discussion of *Ni. U. 5 Su. 23*.

**Method of receiving a bed-spread:**

**10.** It is not proper to first receive the bed-spread from the *nirgrantha* or *nirgranthi* and then seek their permission.

**11.** It is proper to first seek permission from the *nirgrantha* or *nirgranthi* and then receive the bed-spread.

**12.** However, one should know this: If it is difficult to obtain a *pratiharic* bed-spread from the *nirgrantha* or *nirgranthi*, then it is proper to first receive the bed-spread and then seek their permission. "May it be well, sir! Please give it." This should be said in a respectful and polite manner.

---------------------------
[Seventh Uddeshak] [409 12. If it is known that a Nirgrantha-Nirgranthi does not have a suitable bed-spread available here, then it is permissible to first take a place or bed-spread and then seek permission later. (But if there is any kind of conflict between the Sannyasins and the owner of the bed-spread, then the Acharya should tell them - 'O Aryas! On the one hand, you have taken residence here, on the other hand, you are speaking harsh words to them') "O Aryas! You should not behave in such a double-faulting manner with them." In this way, the Acharya should appease the owner of the residence with kind words. Discussion - If one has to sit or stay at any place, then the monk should first seek permission, and only then should he stay there. Similarly, if one has to take any material like cloth or grass, then one should first seek permission, and only then should one take it or use it. Taking anything without seeking permission first and then seeking permission is against the rules / This violates the third Mahavrata. However, in the sutra, keeping in mind the scarcity of houses, an exception has been given to take it in this way in certain circumstances. This exception should not be overused or misused except in special circumstances, and it should also be kept in mind that the decision of the exceptional situation can only be made by the Geetaarth (Bahushruta) monk. If an Alpgyan Abahushruta-Ageetartha monk does this, then this is his unauthorized act. However, they can perform this exception under the guidance of Geetaarth-Bahushruta. In the explanation of the last sentence of this sutra, it is said that - "In a village where there is a rare bed, some Sadhagas go there and stay in a suitable house without seeking permission, and the owner of the house becomes angry and starts arguing. Then, other monks or the Acharya arrive from behind and say to that Sadhu with anger that "Oh Arya! Why are you committing this double crime / You are staying in their house, and you are also arguing with them. Be quiet, keep quiet / " In this way, scolding him, then appease the house owner and politely talk to him and get permission. For more discussion, see Dasha. D. 2 / Request for a spoiled or forgotten tool 13. Nigganthassam Gahavaikulam Pindavaaya Padiyaaye Anupavitthassam Annayare Ahalahusae Uvagaranjaaye Paribhathe Sia.

## 13. If a Niggrantha householder enters a house for food and drops a small item, and a Sarmic Shraman sees it, he should take it with the intention of returning it to its owner. When he encounters another Shraman, he should ask, "Arya, do you recognize this item?" If the Shraman replies, "Yes, I recognize it," then he should return the item. If the Shraman replies, "I don't recognize it," then the Niggrantha should neither use it himself nor give it to anyone else, but should leave it on a secluded, lifeless ground.

## 14. If a Niggrantha drops a small item while going to or from the Vyavahara-bhoomi or the Vihar-bhoomi, and a Sarmic Shraman sees it, he should take it with the intention of returning it to its owner. When he encounters another Shraman, he should ask, "Arya, do you recognize this item?" If the Shraman replies, "Yes, I recognize it," then he should return the item. If the Shraman replies, "I don't recognize it," then the Niggrantha should neither use it himself nor give it to anyone else, but should leave it on a secluded, lifeless ground.

## Eighth Precept:

**[411 15. If a non-Jain's equipment falls while traveling from village to village, and a Sārmika Śramaṇa sees it and thinks, "I will give it to its owner," he should carry it even a long distance. When he sees another Śramaṇa, he should ask, "Ārya, do you recognize this equipment?" If the other Śramaṇa says, "Yes, I recognize it," he should give it to him. If he says, "I don't recognize it," he should neither use it himself nor give it to anyone else, but should leave it on a secluded, suitable ground. **

**Discussion:** If a monk's small equipment, such as clothing, falls while going for contemplation, walking, etc., and another monk sees it on the same path, he should pick it up and think, "Whose equipment is this?" Then he should show the equipment to those monks and ask, and give it to the owner. If none of the nearby monks claim it, he should leave it if it is small or not very useful. If it is a large equipment, such as a broom, he should carry it with him for some distance while walking, etc., and ask other monks when he meets them. If the owner of the equipment cannot be found, and it is useful and needed, he can use it after taking permission from the Guru and other householders. However, he should not use it before inquiring, investigating, or seeking permission. If it is known to be a monk's clothing, etc., but it could also belong to a householder, it is necessary to seek permission from the householder again. Generally, one should not use such equipment of unknown ownership. Because there is a possibility of distress, etc., being caused by its owner later. Or, if someone has deliberately enchanted the equipment and left it on the path, it could also be harmful to use. If the found equipment is in good condition, it should not be broken and left. But it should be left intact in a suitable place or with a suitable person, with an explanation.

**Additional Rule for Bringing Extra Utensils:** **16. If a monk or a non-Jain has an extra utensil for the benefit of another, even if it is far away, and he thinks, "He will carry it, or I will carry it, or someone else will carry it," he should not give it to another without asking or informing. He should give it to another only after asking and informing.**

## 412 //  [Vyavahar Sutra 16. It is not proper to take the extra Patra meant for Nirgranth-Nirgranthis for oneself or to give it to someone else. / 'He will take it, I will keep it, or if someone else needs it, I will give it to them.' Thus, it is not proper to give or invite someone else to take the Patra meant for someone else without asking them or inviting them. / It is proper to give or invite someone else after asking or inviting them. / The quantity and measure of each Upadhi of a Vivechan-Bhikshu is fixed. If the quantity of any Upadhi is not available in the Agam, then its quantity is determined according to the Gan-Samachari. The number of Patra is not clearly stated in the Agam. In the Niyukti Bhashya etc., one Patra or two Patra including a unit is determined, but since keeping many Patra is proven by the Agam, according to the current Gan-Samachari, there are different traditions of keeping 4-6 or more. The rule here is to take Patra in excess of the limit of the Gan, or to order extra Patra from where it is available. When taking such Patra, the Acharya-Upadhyaya or the particular person whose instruction is given to the householder should be given first and invited. Later, it can be given to someone else. / In Nishita U. 14 Sutra 5, there is a description of taking Patra for the purpose and purpose of the Gani, and there, in Sutra 6-7, there is a provision for giving extra Patra only to the incapable. Therefore, allowing to take extra Patra is the subject of the authority of the Acharya etc. Gitas. For a special description, see the discussion of Nishita U. 14. The quantity of Unodari of food is 17. 1. Eating food with one Kavala equal to the size of one's mouth is called Alpahar. 2. Eating food with twelve Kavala equal to the size of one's mouth is called Ardho-Unodarika. 


Page #233:
---------------------------
## Eighth Objective [413]

3. Eating sixteen kavals of food according to one's mouth-measure is called **dvibhaga-prapta aahar** (two-part obtained food) and **ardha-unodari** (half-unodari).

4. Eating twenty-four kavals of food according to one's mouth-measure is called **tribhaga-prapta aahar** (three-part obtained food) and **eka-bhaga-unodarika** (one-part unodarika).

5. Eating thirty-three kavals of food according to one's mouth-measure is called **kinchit-unodarika** (slightly unodarika).

6. Eating thirty-two kavals of food according to one's mouth-measure is called **pramana-prapta aahar** (measure-obtained food). A Shraman who eats even one kaval less than this is not called **nirgrantha prakama-bhoji** (a liberated one who eats according to the rules).

**Discussion:**

The Bhagavati Sutra, Shatak 7 and Shatak 25, as well as the Uvvaiya Sutra, also mention similar statements regarding the **unodari** penance. Along with the nature of **aahar-dravya-unodari** (food-substance unodari), they also explain the distinctions of **upakarana-unodari** (instrument unodari) etc.

The Uttara Adhyayana 30, in its description of penance, only mentions **aahar-unodari**. It does not discuss the distinctions of **upakarana-unodari** etc. It mentions five types of **aahar-unodari**: (1) **dravya** (substance), (2) **kshetra** (field), (3) **kal** (time), (4) **bhav** (feeling), and (5) **paryaya** (alternative).

(1) **Dravya** - Eating less than one's full quota of food.

(2) **Kshetra** - Acquiring things related to a village or other area, or acquiring things like a begging bowl in six shapes while wandering for alms.

(3) **Kal** - Acquiring things in the form of the time of bringing and eating food, like a watch or an hour.

(4) **Bhav** - Acquiring things from the house, or acquiring things based on the caste, clothes, or feelings of men and women.

(5) **Paryaya** - Acquiring one thing from each of the above four types of **dravya** etc. is included in those respective distinctions. Acquiring many things from these four types together is called **paryaya-unodari**.

The present Sutra describes the first type, **dravya-unodari**, through the following five distinctions:

(1) **Alpa-aahar** (less food) - Eating one kaval, two kavals, or up to the prescribed kaval measure is called **alpa-aahar-unodari**.

(2) **Aparadh-unodari** (less than half unodari) - Eating nine to twelve kavals or fifteen kavals is considered eating less than half the quota. This is called **aparadh-unodari**. This is the first type of **unodari** called **alpa-aahar**, and the second type is called **unodari** because it is less than half the quota.

(3) **Dvibhaga-prapta-unodari** (two-part obtained unodari) - Eating sixteen kavals is considered eating half the quota. When the full quota is divided into four parts, this is two parts. Therefore, the Sutra calls it **dvibhaga-prapta-unodari**. Since it is two parts of the unodari, it can also be called **ardha-unodari**.

(4) **Tribhaga-prapta-anshika-unodari** (three-part obtained unodari) - Eating twenty-four kavals (twenty-seven to thirty kavals) is considered three-part food and one-part unodari. The Sutra uses the term **anshika-unodari** for this. In this, three parts of the four parts of food are eaten, so it is **tribhaga-prapta-aahar-rupa-unodari**. Or it can also be called **pav-unodari**. 

Page #234:
---------------------------
[414] The Vyavahar Sutra can be cited. Due to scribal errors, there are variations in the text of the manuscripts at this place, therefore the text has been corrected from other Agamas. / In the manuscripts, readings like 'promoyarie' and 'pattomoyarie' are available. (5) On examining the evidence of the Kicchit-Unodari-31 Kaval, it is found that there is only one Kaval of Unodari, which is called 'Kicchit Unodari' because it is less than the 32 Kaval diet. / The last part of the Sutra clarifies that a monk who performs any of these five types of Unodari is not a Prakamabhoji (one who eats to his fill). One who consumes a full diet of 32 Kavals is called a Pramanapraptabhoji. / He does not even have a Kicchit Unodari. It is essential for a monk to always perform Unodari tapas for sensory restraint and Brahmacharya Samadhi, i.e., he should never eat to his fill. In Aacha. Shru. 1 A. 9 U. 4, while describing the diet and conduct of Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, it is said that even in a healthy state, Bhagwan always consumed food with Unodari tapas. / As it is said, "Promoyariam chaei apuche vi Bhagavam rogehin". / In Ga. 1 Niti, it is also said, "Sant Sati ne Surama, Chauthi Vidhava Nar. Aita to Bhookha Bhala Dhaya Kare Utpat". // In the Sutra, the term 'Kukkuttiandakpraman' has been used to clarify the Kavalpraman. In this regard, the following explanations have been given in the commentary texts: (1) Nijakasyaharasy sada yo dvatrimshattamo bhago tat kukkutipramane - the thirty-second part of one's own diet is always called the Kukkuttiandakpraman, i.e., the Kaval of that day. (2) Kutsita kuti-kukkutii sharirmityarthaha. Tasyah sharirrupaayaah kukkutayah andakamiv andakam mukha asuchi may - this body itself is the Kukkutti, its mouth is called the egg of the Kukkutti. (3) Yavatpramanamaatrena kavalena mukhe prakshipyamanena mukha na vikritam bhavat tatstala kukkutaandak-pramanam - one should understand a Kaval of such a size that when placed in the mouth, the mouth does not appear distorted. / The inner shape of the mouth that is formed for the inclusion of that Kaval should be understood as the Kukkuttiandakpraman. / (4) Ayamanayah vikalpah kukkuta andakopame kavale athava kukudi ke ande ke praman jitna kaval, yah bhi arth ka ek vikalpah hai. - 'Unoryaria' - Abhi. Ra. Kosh Bha. 2, p. 1182. Considering the above-mentioned explanations, it is known that even without the word 'Kukkuttiandang', the meaning of the Sutra becomes clear, and this word is also misleading, therefore this word should never be used. 

Page #235:
---------------------------
## Eighth Objective] 415 This has been projected by someone and the commentators have tried to harmonize it by understanding it as the original text. The commentary also states that one who takes a full meal once a day is a 'Prakambhoji', one who takes a full meal for many days is a 'Nikambhoji' and one who eats more than 32 kavals is an 'Atibhoji'. Here a question arises: is the complete measure mentioned for 32 kavals of food in relation to each meal or in relation to multiple meals? And how are milk, buttermilk, and other beverages included in these 32 kavals? Solution - From the observation of the Praachara Shastras, it becomes clear that eating once a day is the pure Utsarga Praachara of a monk. The rules for eating at other times mentioned in the Agamas should be understood as exceptions. Accepting exceptional conduct as a permanent tendency is laxity in conduct. Therefore, eating multiple times due to a reason or eating in the morning and evening is an exceptional path. The Utsargamarga is to eat only once. Therefore, this rule is in relation to the Prautsargik food taken once a day as mentioned earlier. The complete quantity, which fills the stomach completely, provides full satisfaction, or which does not leave a desire to eat more or to remain hungry, should be divided into 32 kavals. Milk, bread, fruits, etc., should all be included in this. The number of kavals that can be consumed without feeling hungry should be considered as the Unodari. Generally, the monk's food on the Utsargamarga is free from impurities, therefore, it becomes easier to understand 32 kavals in relation to bread, etc. Based on this, it is concluded that the total amount of food taken multiple times due to a reason should be 32 kavals. Therefore, if one has to eat multiple times, then 32 kavals should be divided and understood accordingly. By eating a normal, impurity-free meal once a day for many days, the total amount of food can be measured in terms of the number of breads. Sutra 1 2-4 _ Summary of the Eighth Objective: To accept the Shayanasanabhoomi with the permission of the Sthavir Guru, etc. The Pat, etc., should be brought easily, such that it can be lifted with one hand. Its investigation can be done for three days, and the investigation of the Pat according to the Sthavirvas can be done for five days and can also be brought from a longer distance. If an Eklavichari old monk has many types of Propagrahic equipment, then he should leave them in the care of someone while going for alms, etc., and inform them upon returning and then take them. 

Page #236:
---------------------------
[416] [Vyavahar Sutra Sutra 6.9] If a householder needs to take a bed, bedding, or other shelter (house) from another householder, then they should ask for their permission again. If they have left a mat or other shelter for a short time, then they should ask for permission again to take it, but they should not take it without permission. Because it has been left for a short time under their protection. 10-12 _ It is necessary to ask for permission for a house, mat, etc. before taking it. _ In the case of a rare bed, it can be taken first with discretion and then permission can be sought. _ 13-15 If a monk's equipment falls on the road while traveling and another monk finds it, they should inquire and give it to the owner. _ If no one claims it, they should leave it. If it is a large piece of equipment like a dustpan, etc., then they should take it further and inquire. If additional utensils have been taken under the instructions of the Acharya, etc., then they should be given to them or entrusted to them. _ They should not give it to anyone they wish to give it to. _ If the name of the person to whom it is to be given has been instructed, then they should give it to them first after taking permission from the Acharya. They should always practice some form of Unodari tapas. One who practices Unodari is not called a Prakamabhoji. Conclusion: In this Uddeshak, Sutras 1-4, 6-12 discuss the taking of a bed, seat, mat, etc., the solitary elder, 13-15 the lost equipment, 16 the bringing and giving of additional utensils, the Unodari of food, etc. // Eighth Uddeshak ends //

Discussion: The previous sutras have laid down the rules for accepting and not accepting from the houses of Shayatarapindas. These sutras lay down the rules for accepting and not accepting food or other articles from shops. The meaning of these sutras is that if a Shayatar's ownership is not involved in any divided goods in a collective shop of Shayatar and Ashayatar (other householders), or if any article is independently owned by another householder, then there is no fault of Shayatarapinda in accepting it. Therefore, such articles from the shops mentioned in the sutras can be accepted with discretion when invited by a householder or when necessary. The articles from the shops mentioned in the sutras are as follows: (1) oil etc., (2) jaggery etc., (3) any un-chitt articles of grains and groceries, (4) clothes, (5) thread, (6) cotton, (7) fragrant oils and perfumes (as medicine for illness), (8) sweets, (9) food items, (10) mangoes and other un-chitt fruits (boiled or without kernels). 

These sutras make it clear that Sadhus and Sadhvis can accept Kalpyavastu from shops besides houses. In Dashav. A. 5 U. 1 Ga. 72, it is also forbidden to accept food items containing Raj from shops, i.e., they can be accepted if they are Raj-free. Here, the commentator has clarified that one must definitely be mindful of the environment, time, person, and general public. Otherwise, accepting articles from shops can harm the Sadhu or even the Jain religion. "Sodiyasala -"Sukhado" Tiprsidhmisthannavicrayasala Kandavikapan Ityarthah" - A shop of Kandoi. - Ni. Bhashya (Ghasi.) 

Page #244:
---------------------------
[424] The term "madhyashala" has been interpreted in the Vyavahar Sutra Bhashya, but Sadhus and Sadhvis have no contact with alcohol or meat, because these substances are mentioned in the Agam as causes of hell. Therefore, the above interpretation is appropriate. For more information on this topic, see the discussion in Nishita U. 19 Su. 1. 

37. The Sapta-Saptamika (seven-seven-day) Bhikshu-Pratima is observed for ninety days with one hundred sixty-nine Bhikshadattis, according to the Sutra and the Jina's command. 
38. The Atta-Attamika (eight-eight-day) Bhikshu-Pratima is observed for sixty-four days with two hundred eighty-eight Bhikshadattis, according to the Sutra and the Jina's command. 
39. The Nava-Navamika (nine-nine-day) Bhikshu-Pratima is observed for ninety-one days with four hundred five Bhikshadattis, according to the Sutra and the Jina's command. 
40. The Das-Dasamika (ten-ten-day) Bhikshu-Pratima is observed for one hundred days with five hundred fifty Bhikshadattis, according to the Sutra and the Jina's command. 

Discussion: These Sutras describe four Pratimas, which both Sadhus and Sadhvis can observe. The eighth chapter of the Antagad Sutra describes the observance of these Bhikshu-Pratimas by Sukrushna Prarya. In these Pratimas, Sadhvis also bring their own Gochari, in which the prescribed limits of Bhikshadatti are observed for the specified days. In these Pratimas, less than the prescribed number of Dattis can be accepted, or Anashan Tapasya can also be performed. However, for any reason, more than the prescribed number of Dattis cannot be accepted.

## Ninth Uddeshak

[425 In these models, it is not necessary to perform austerities like fasting, etc., naturally, Unodari Tapa often happens by itself / The Sapta-Saptathika Bhiksha-Pratima - for the first seven days, one Datti each, for the next seven days, two Dattis each, and so on, in the seventh Saptak, seven Dattis each are taken / In this way, there are 49 days in seven Saptaks and the total maximum number of Bhiksha-Dattis is 196 / These Dattis are in relation to Pahar / It should be understood that the same number of Dattis are also in relation to water. Similarly, the Ashta-Ashtamika Bhiksha-Pratima - text is completed in 64 days from Ashtak / In which, on the first day, one Datti of food and one Datti of water are taken / Increasing in this way, in the eighth Ashtak, eight Dattis of food and eight Dattis of water can be taken daily. In this way, there are a total of 64 days and 288 Bhiksha-Dattis. Similarly, the "Nava-Navamika" and Dasava-Samika Pratima - should also be understood according to the number of days and Dattis mentioned in the Sutra. In Brihatkalpa U. 5, a Sadhvi is also prohibited from going to Gochari alone / Therefore, in these models, it is necessary to keep other Sadhvis with the Sadhvi who brings independent Gochari, but she herself performs Gochari. These Pratimas are also indicated by the word "Bhikshu-Pratima" in the Sutra / Still, to observe them, there is no need for knowledge of the previous twelve Bhikshu-Pratimas or specific endurance.

## The *Vyavahar Sutra* on *Prasravan* Practices:

**Two *Prasravan* Practices are mentioned:**

1. **Small *Prasravan* Practice:** This practice is undertaken in the beginning of autumn or at the end of summer, outside the village or capital, in a forest, forest fortress, on a mountain, or in a mountain fortress. The *anagari* (non-householder) should undertake this practice. If the *anagari* eats food on the day they begin the practice, they should complete it with six fasts. If they begin the practice without eating, they should complete it with seven fasts. 

**Rules for the *Prasravan* Practice:**

* The *bhiksu* (monk) should drink their urine whenever it comes. They should drink it during the day, but not at night.
* They should not drink urine that contains worms, but they should drink urine that is free of worms.
* They should drink urine that contains semen, but they should not drink urine that is free of semen.
* They should not drink urine that contains oil, but they should drink urine that is free of oil.
* They should not drink urine that contains blood, but they should drink urine that is free of blood.
* They should drink all the urine that comes, whether it is little or much.

This small *Prasravan* practice should be followed according to the *sutra* and the knowledge of the *Jina*.

2. **Large *Prasravan* Practice:** This practice is undertaken in the beginning of autumn or at the end of summer, outside the village or capital, in a forest, forest fortress, on a mountain, or in a mountain fortress. The *anagari* should undertake this practice. If the *anagari* eats food on the day they begin the practice, they should complete it with seven fasts. If they begin the practice without eating, they should complete it with eight fasts. 

**Rules for the *Prasravan* Practice:**

* The *bhiksu* should drink their urine whenever it comes. They should drink it during the day, but not at night.

This large *Prasravan* practice should be followed according to the *sutra* and the knowledge of the *Jina*.

**Discussion:**

This *sutra* describes two *bhiksu* practices. Only *nirgrantha* (those who have renounced all worldly possessions) can undertake these practices. *Nirgranthi* women cannot undertake these practices. These practices are undertaken in isolation, outside the village, in the forest or mountains, for seven to eight days. 

The *bhasya* (commentary) states that only those who have completed three *sanhanan* (stages of spiritual development) and are *purvadhari* (those who have renounced all worldly possessions) can undertake these practices. These practices are undertaken in the months of *Prashtadha* (July-August) or *Mrigashirsha* (November-December).

One of the two *Prasravan* practices involves seven nights of *kayotsarga* (a practice of complete relaxation and stillness), and is called the small *Prasravan* practice. The other practice involves eight nights of *kayotsarga*, and is called the large *Prasravan* practice.

Both practices can be started with a fast on the first day, or by eating food on the first day. Those who eat food on the first day have one less day of fasting, but the duration of *kayotsarga* is the same for everyone.

## Ninth Uddeshak [427]

After holding these images, all four types of food are abandoned, only drinking one's own urine remains open, meaning that on those days, whenever and however much urine comes, it is drunk following the prescribed rules. / The rules are as follows: (1) Drink during the day, not at night. (2) If it is mixed with worms, semen, menstrual fluid, or oil, it should not be drunk. / If it is pure, it should be drunk. / The commentator has stated that the aforementioned blood, oiliness, etc., of the image-holding monk may be due to some disease or due to austerity and the heat of the sun. / Sometimes this happens for the purification of the body's disorders by drinking urine alone. / Although this image-holder practices austerity and remains in Vyutsargatap throughout the day and night, yet when there is an obstruction of urine, he abandons Kayotsarg, abandons the flow in Matrak, transcribes it and drinks it. / Then he becomes stable again in Kayotsarg. / This is the method of this image. / The one who follows this image worships the path of liberation. / Along with that, his physical diseases are removed and he gets a strong body with the color of gold. After the image-paradhan, he returns to the Upashraya. / The commentary describes the gradual method of taking food and water for 49 days during his parana. In common practice, urine is considered secluded, impure, and unclean, but in medical texts it is called Sarvoshadhi, Shivaambu, etc., and in Jain Agamas, the monk is called "Moyasmayare" and the householder is called "Shuchisamachari". In the Abhidhana Ratnakosha, the word "Nishakalpa" is described as being useful for the sadhu to use it for Achaman in place of water at night. / Drinking one's own urine according to the prescribed method and applying it to the skin of the body removes many incurable diseases. It is a successful medicine for skin diseases or any kind of injury, wound, etc. / Therefore, in the Agamas, urine is not considered secluded, impure, or unclean, but is considered drinkable and impure according to the situation. The commentator has also stated that the general public is cleanliness-oriented and considers urine to be secluded and impure, therefore the image-holding monk should drink urine with such discretion that no one sees him transcribing it around. / Accordingly, other monks should also have the discretion to do any activity related to excretion in a way that is unseen and unknown to the general public. / In the present time, the importance of urine therapy has increased a lot, independent books on this subject have also been published, which also mention the relief of incurable diseases like cancer, TB, etc. Datti-Pramannirupan 43. Sankhadatt's monk, who holds the image (Gahavaakulan Pindavai-Padiae, Anupavitu) goes on and on, whatever images he has taken, he should give them to Datti, that is the truth. 

Page #248:
---------------------------
[428] If the food is offered to the bowl by one, two or many, all of it should be considered as one *datti*. If many people offer food to the bowl, all of it should be considered as one *datti*. 44. If a *karpaatra-bhoji* *nirgrantha* householder enters a house for food, and the householder offers food to the *bhikkhu's* hand, then the number of times the householder offers food should be counted as the number of *dattis*. If the householder offers food to the *bhikkhu's* hand using a ladle, cloth or sieve without stopping, then all of it should be considered as one *datti*. If many householders offer food to the *bhikkhu's* hand, all of it should be considered as one *datti*. 43. If a *paatra-dhari* *nirgrantha* householder enters a house for food, and the householder offers food to the bowl, then the number of times the householder offers food should be counted as the number of *dattis*. If the householder offers food to the bowl using a ladle, cloth or sieve without stopping, then all of it should be considered as one *datti*. If many householders offer food to the bowl, all of it should be considered as one *datti*.  /  Discussion - The *Sapta-Saptathika* and other *bhikkhu* images describe the number of *dattis* for receiving food. This *sutra* explains the nature of *datti*. 

Page #249:
---------------------------
## Ninth Uddeshak [429]

A 'datti' is the amount of food or water given to a sadhu in one go, without breaking the flow of the offering. It doesn't matter if the datti is given by hand, from a vessel, or from a soup bowl, etc. It doesn't matter if it is given in small amounts or in large amounts without stopping. All of this is considered a single datti. If food is kept in multiple vessels or in the hands of multiple people, and it is collected into one vessel or one hand and given to the sadhu, it is still considered a single datti. For a kar-patri bhikku (who does not carry a vessel), the amount of food given in one go, using the methods described above, is considered a datti.

## Three Types of Food [45]

There are three types of food:

1. **Falitopharit:** Food that is mixed with various ingredients, such as sweets, savory dishes, etc.
2. **Shuddhopharit:** Pure, unmixed food that is not smeared, such as chickpeas, mamra, puffed rice, etc.
3. **Sansrushttopharit:** Pure, smeared food that is not mixed with other ingredients, such as rice, roti, ghat, khichdi, etc.

## Types of Avagrit Food [46]

There are three types of Avagrit food:

1. **Jhanch Proginhai:** Food that is taken for serving.
2. **Jhanch Saharai:** Food that is being carried for serving.
3. **Jhanch Asamanshi (Thasaganshi) Pakkhivai:** Food that is being served in a vessel.

Some acharyas say that there are only two types of Avagrit food:

1. **Jhanch Oginhai:** Food that is taken for serving.
2. **Jhanch Asaganshi (Thasaganshi) Pakkhivai:** Food that is being served in a vessel. 

Page #250:
---------------------------
[430] These are the rules of conduct. However, some teachers say that there are two types of food that is not to be accepted, namely: 1. Food that is being taken for serving. 2. Food that is being served in a vessel. Discussion - In the previous sutra, three types of food were mentioned, and in the present sutra, three stages of accepting food by the giver are mentioned: (1) Food is being taken from the place where it is kept or prepared and placed in another vessel. (2) Food is being taken and carried for serving. (3) Food has been served in a plate or similar vessel, but eating has not begun. / The commentator has said that all three stages are forms of the sixth type of *piṇḍeṣaṇā*. In many manuscripts, the word "prāsagansī" is available for the third type, which has two meanings: (1) Food being put into the mouth for eating. (2) Food being put into the mouth of the vessel. Both these meanings are not relevant here because in the sixth type of *piṇḍeṣaṇā*, the third type of food being taken for eating is the food that is served in a plate or similar vessel, which is the appropriate meaning. / This is also conceivable because it is the stage before eating begins. / However, taking food that is being put into the mouth for eating is inappropriate and impractical, and food that is being put into the mouth of the vessel is not a form of the sixth type of *piṇḍeṣaṇā* and is therefore not relevant in the sequence. / Therefore, it is likely that due to a scribal error, the word "prāsagansī" has become a substitute for the word "thāsagansī" or "thālagansī". In the *Bhagavati Sūtra*, chapter 11, verse 11, page 1951 (published from Sailāna), the words "thāl" and "thāsag" are used, which are interpreted as "thālī" (plate) and "tāstarī" (plate) respectively. Therefore, here the word "thāsagansī" or "thālagansī" is considered correct and the meaning is explained accordingly. In the second part of the sutra, two types of food taken for eating are mentioned from the perspective of alternative expectations, namely: taking from the original vessel and serving in a plate or similar vessel. / In this alternative, it is expected that the food is taken from one vessel and served in a plate or similar vessel while sitting at the place where the food is kept, but there is no intention of walking or taking it far away for serving. The sutra uses the phrase "age puṇ evamāhansu". This creates the possibility of a difference of opinion, but it should be understood that the structure of the sutra is based on two expectations. Because it is difficult to imagine that there would be a difference of opinion among the previous teachers about such a common matter and that it would be included in the sutra.

[Ninth Uddeshak] [431 While such phrases are in the form of many commands at the beginning of the Jivaabhigamsutra, there are two, three, four, etc. distinctions of beings mentioned there. That statement should not be understood as a difference of opinion, but rather as different perspectives. The commentator has also explained it in the same way. Therefore, even though the words "age pun evamasu" are used here, it should not be understood as a difference of opinion. The commentator has also defined it as "pradesh" and explained that it refers to different perspectives that have come down from many debates. Therefore, both parts of the present sutra should be understood as "aadesh". The summary of the ninth Uddeshak is as follows: Sutras 1-8, 17-36, 37-40, 41-42: A monk can take food from the servants or guests of a Shayatar, if it is given by the Praatiharik (with the option to return the remaining food), but should not take it if it is not given by the Praatiharik. It is not proper to take food from the relatives of a Shayatar who earn their livelihood with his help, even if they cook or eat it. If there are any items in the shops owned by a Shayatar that are not part of the partnership, they can be taken from the partner. Or, if the partnership is dissolved, any item can be taken. By accepting alms according to the limits of the seven-septak, eight-ashtak, nine-navak, and ten-dashak, monks and nuns can worship four types of Bhikku pratima. The small and large pratima of self-urine drinking are worshipped for seven and eight days respectively. In this, the completely pure and sutra-prescribed urine is drunk only during the day, not at night. Food, etc., given in one continuous stream into the hand or vessel of a monk is called one datti. There are three types of food: (1) processed food, (2) pure un-anointed food, (3) pure anointed food. Any of these can be accepted. There are three stages of food suitable for the sixth Pindeshana, called "pragaheet": (1) while taking it out of the vessel, (2) while taking it to serve, (3) while serving it on a plate, etc. Or, from a perspective, there can be two stages of that food: (1) while taking it out of the vessel, (2) while serving it on a plate, etc. 43-44, 45, 56.

[432] [Vyavahar Sutra Upasamhar 37-42 In this Uddeshak, the subject of Kalyakalpya and Akalyakalpya food items for Shayatar, the Datti-Parimana of Pratimas, the Prasravana-Pana Pratimas, the Datti Swaroop, the types of food suitable for Abhigraha, etc. have been discussed. // Ninth Uddeshak ends // 45-46

---------------------------
The tenth Uddeshak (chapter) describes two types of Chandrapratima (moon images): 1. Two types of Padhima (images) - 1. Javmajjha Chandrapratima (moon image with a full moon), 2. Vairamjjha Chandrapratima (moon image with a crescent moon).

The Javmajjha Chandrapratima is for the Pravrajya (renunciation) of an Anugara (lay follower) who is constantly observing the month of Vosaṭṭaka (the month of fasting) with a pure body.

If any Pariṣahovasagga (circumstances) arise, whether divine, human, animal, Anuloma (favorable), or Padiloma (unfavorable), then in the case of Anuloma, one should offer Vandana (salutation), Namaskara (prostration), Sakkara (respect), Sammana (honor), and wish for their well-being and prosperity. In the case of Padiloma, one should not retaliate with a stick, bone, fire, weapon, or any other means. One should tolerate, forgive, endure, and be patient.

The Javmajjha Chandrapratima is suitable for the Pravrajya of an Anugara who is observing the Sukkapakkha (bright fortnight) of the month. It is suitable for accepting one gift of food, one gift of drink, and for accepting food and drink from the seven types of Aharakkha (food and drink) that are permitted. Many Samanas (monks) and Vanimagas (merchants) have observed this practice.

It is suitable for accepting one gift of food from a single person, not two, three, four, or five. It is not suitable for accepting gifts from a pregnant woman, a child, or a woman who is menstruating. It is not suitable for accepting gifts from a woman who is in labor, even if she is only a few days away from giving birth. It is not suitable for accepting gifts from a woman who is in labor, even if she is only a few days away from giving birth.

However, it is acceptable to accept gifts from a woman who is in labor if she is only a few days away from giving birth, as long as she is not in pain.

The second type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting two gifts of food and two gifts of drink.

The third type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting three gifts of food and three gifts of drink.

The fourth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting four gifts of food and four gifts of drink.

The fifth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting five gifts of food and five gifts of drink.

The sixth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting six gifts of food and six gifts of drink.

The seventh type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting seven gifts of food and seven gifts of drink.

The eighth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting eight gifts of food and eight gifts of drink.

The ninth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting nine gifts of food and nine gifts of drink.

The tenth type of Chandrapratima is suitable for accepting ten gifts of food and ten gifts of drink.

## 436 [Vyavahar Sutra]

It is prescribed to consume three *dattis* each of food and water on the thirteenth day of the *vyavaharsutra*. On the fourteenth day, it is prescribed to consume two *dattis* each of food and water. On the *amavasya* (new moon) day, it is prescribed to consume one *datti* each of food and water. On the first day of the bright fortnight, it is prescribed to consume two *dattis* each of food and water. On the second day, it is prescribed to consume three *dattis* each of food and water. On the third day, it is prescribed to consume four *dattis* each of food and water. On the fourth day, it is prescribed to consume five *dattis* each of food and water. On the fifth day, it is prescribed to consume six *dattis* each of food and water. On the sixth day, it is prescribed to consume seven *dattis* each of food and water. On the seventh day, it is prescribed to consume eight *dattis* each of food and water. On the eighth day, it is prescribed to consume nine *dattis* each of food and water. On the ninth day, it is prescribed to consume ten *dattis* each of food and water. On the tenth day, it is prescribed to consume eleven *dattis* each of food and water. On the eleventh day, it is prescribed to consume twelve *dattis* each of food and water. On the twelfth day, it is prescribed to consume thirteen *dattis* each of food and water. On the thirteenth day, it is prescribed to consume fourteen *dattis* each of food and water. On the fourteenth day, it is prescribed to consume fifteen *dattis* each of food and water. On the *purnima* (full moon) day, he observes a fast. Thus, this is followed according to the *vajramadhyachandrapratima sutra* and as per the knowledge of the Jinas. 

**Discussion:** Just as the phases of the moon increase in the bright fortnight and decrease in the dark fortnight, similarly, the number of *dattis* of food in these two *pratiamas* is decreased and increased in accordance with the order of the lunar days. Therefore, these two *pratiamas* are called "Chandrapratima". Just as a grain of barley (cereal) is thin at one end, then thick in the middle, and thin at the end, similarly, the *pratima* in which one *datti* is consumed at the beginning, fifteen *dattis* in the middle, one *datti* at the end, and then a fast is observed, is called "Yavamadhyachandrapratima". Just as a vajra gem or a *damaru* (drum) has a wide end, a narrow middle part, and a wide other end, similarly, the *pratima* in which fifteen *dattis* are consumed at the beginning, one *datti* in the middle, fifteen *dattis* at the end, and then a fast is observed, is called "Vajramadhyachandrapratima". These two *pratiamas* can only be observed by a monk who is particularly strong and has a good past. In these *pratiamas*, the *dattis* of food and water are consumed in accordance with the *sutra*, gradually decreasing and increasing. Along with the number of *dattis* of food and water, the monk observing these *pratiamas* must also follow the following rules: 

Page #259:
---------------------------
## The 8th Uddeshak:

**(1)** Renunciation of bodily attachment, meaning abstaining from all bodily activities except for the consumption of regulated, limited food and the use of medicines. 

**(2)** Not retaliating or avoiding any harm inflicted by gods, humans, or animals.

**(3)** Maintaining equanimity and not feeling pleased when receiving respect or veneration.

**(4)** Entering a house for food only after animals have finished grazing and birds have finished eating, if they are present in the path or outside the house.

**(5)** Accepting food from unknown houses where the resident is unaware of the arrival of the Padimadhari or where no one is waiting for them.

**(6)** Consuming coarse food devoid of any impurities or defects.

**(7)** Consuming food that is pure and free from any external substances.

**(8)** Not going to the same place where other mendicants are seeking alms.

**(9)** Accepting food from only one person, not from multiple people.

**(10)** Not accepting alms from a pregnant woman.

**(11)** Not accepting alms from someone carrying a young child.

**(12)** Not accepting alms from a woman breastfeeding a child.

**(13)** Not accepting alms from anyone standing outside the threshold of the house.

**(14)** Accepting alms from a donor sitting or standing with one foot inside and one foot outside the threshold.

It is essential for Padimadharis to follow the 42 faults of Eshana and other methods mentioned in the scriptures. These two Chandrapratima are worshipped once a month. If food is received according to these rules, it should be accepted; if not, one should fast that day. The Padimadhari monk determines the time for alms and the number of houses to visit and travels accordingly. If food is not received, it becomes an excellent one-month penance. However, they do not make any exceptions to these rules.

The commentary states that only a monk who has completed 20 years of initiation, has undergone three Sanhananas, and possesses the knowledge of the nine previous births can wear these two Pratiamas. The commentary also reveals that the text "Sabvehi dupppay-chaupppay-maiyehi aahar kankhihin sattehi padiniyhi" was not available to the commentator. They explained the words and sentences individually but did not interpret this particular sentence. The meaning of this sentence is...

## The Tenth Uddeshak [41]

**Shraman-Nirgranth are prominent in the conduct of Agamanyavahar.** Among these five types of conduct, whenever and in whatever subject, whichever conduct is available, the Shraman-Nirgranth who conducts himself with that conduct in that subject with a middle path, is a transgressor of Jina-gyan.

**Discussion:** The word "Vyavahar" in the Sutra is used in the sense of atonement. It has also been used in this sense in other Agamas, such as "Ahalahusae namam vavhare pattaviamve sia" - as in the Laghushk (very small) atonement should be established. - Brihatkalp Uddeshak 4.

The decision of atonement should be made only according to the order mentioned in the Sutras like "Pagam" etc. Special faults should be criticized only in the presence of Pagamvyavahari. If they are not available, then the atonement should be taken by criticizing in the presence of those who possess the maximum number of Sutras available in the Sutras and are worthy of listening to criticism. If this is not done, i.e., if it is done in reverse, then atonement has been stated in the commentary.

Five conducts are mentioned in the Sutra as the decisive basis of atonement. The one who possesses them is called Vyavahari.

(1) **Agamvyavahari:** Knowers of 9 Purvas to 14 Purvas, Avadhigyani, Manahparyavgyani and Kevalgyani. These are called "Pragamvyavahari".

(2) **Shrutavyavahari:** Those who have memorized the root, meaning, and ultimate truth of the minor Acharang and Nishit Sutra, and those who have memorized the excellent 9 Purvas or less, are called "Shrutavyavahari".

(3) **Agyavavahari:** One who gives atonement based on the order of an Agamvyavahari or Shrutavyavahari is called "Agyavavahari".

(4) **Dharanavavahari:** If the multi-learned have made some limits of atonement according to the Shrutis and made a worthy monk adopt them, the one who adopts them well is called "Dharanavavahari".

(5) **Jitavavahari:** In matters where there is no clear basis of the Sutra, if the multi-learned monk makes limits of atonement for a worthy monk, which are not against the Sutra and are conducive to restraint, the one who adopts them well is called "Jitavavahari".

**Jangiyamsohikaram, passath pamatt sanjayaingam / Jai vi mahajanainnam, na ten jien vavharo // 720 //**

**Jam jiyam sohikaram, sanvegaparayanen danten / Egen vi prainn, ten u jien vavharo // 721 //**

**-~-Vyav. Bhashya. Uddeshak 10**

**A detached, single-minded, multi-learned person who is served by even one subdued-minded person can be a Jitavavahar, conducive to restraint-purity.** But the one who is served by a nearby, careless, and exceptional monk, is not a Jitavavahar. 

Page #262:
---------------------------
[442] [The conduct-sutra cannot be purified by being served by many, therefore one should not engage in it. So, one who does not perform the pratikramna of the pacchakkhanakala or the svadhyayakala, etc., who remains without a mouth-cloth on his mouth or speaks, and who does not cover water, incurs the pratyaksha of the nivi, all this is jitavyavahar / The "muhantagfidia" in the gatha is explained as "mukhapotikaya sphititaayaam, mukhapotikamantaretiyartha".] _ The pratyaksha given by these five vyavaharis is called agamvyavahar or jitavyavahar. The meaning of this sutra-vidhan is that the first mentioned vyavahar and vyavahari is the main one. In his absence, the later mentioned vyavahar and vyavahari can be given prominence. That is, in matters where shrutvyavahar is available, one should not give prominence to dharana or jitavyavahar in making decisions. Giving prominence in reverse order leads to selfishness or attachment-aversion, etc., and there is no impartiality. To convey this meaning, the last part of the sutra encourages one to engage in vyavahar in accordance with the order, free from attachment-aversion and partiality, and those who engage in vyavahar in the order specified in the sutra and with impartiality are called araadhak. Therefore, it is clear that one who engages in vyavahar with partiality and in reverse order is a viraadhak. Even when the word vyavahar is interpreted broadly by upalakshana, it is fruitful that if one has to make a decision on any practical matter related to the life of a samayami, or if one has to make a decision on any dispute arising in relation to a principle formulated by the agam, then one should do so in this order, i.e., if there is an agamvyavahari, then one should accept his decision and end the dispute / If there is no agamvyavahari, then one should accept the decision based on the available shrut-agam / When the evidence of the sutra is available, one should not give prominence to prajna, dharana or tradition, because shrutvyavahar is more important than prajna, dharana or tradition / In the present time, the agams have the highest place, followed by the interpretations and texts, and then the memorized dharana or tradition held by the sthaviras. Even in interpretations or texts, the creations of the earlier acharyas have a prominent place. Therefore, in the present time, the decisive shastras are the first, and interpretations and texts that say the opposite meaning are not important. Similarly, when shastra-pramana is available, dharana or tradition also has no importance / Therefore, it is the duty of an araadhak to decide any matter by giving prominence to shastra, text, dharana and tradition in order, with discretion, and to avoid any partiality. 

Page #263:
---------------------------
[The Tenth Uddeshak] .[To decide from 443 is the cause of contradiction. Therefore, understanding the meaning of this sutra, one should decide the previous elements impartially / This sutra is also in Bhagavati Sutra Sh. 8 U. 8 and Thanang A. 5 U. 2 / Some discussion has also been done there on this subject / The summary is that the atonement or other elements should be decided sequentially by these five practices, not in reverse. Therefore, in any subject, it should be considered completely inappropriate to insist on belief or tradition while having a previous text. 4. Four types of virtuous men have been said / For example-1. Some virtuous person does work, but does not believe / 2. Some believe, but do not work. 3. Some do work and also believe / 4.

**[444] [Vyavahar Sutra 7. (Again)] Four types of Sadhu Purushas have been mentioned. For example:**

1. **Someone enhances the glory of the Gan but does not have pride.**
2. **Someone has pride but does not enhance the glory of the Gan.**
3. **Someone enhances the glory of the Gan and also has pride.**
4. **Someone neither enhances the glory of the Gan nor has pride.**

**8. (Again) Four types of Sadhu Purushas have been mentioned. For example:**

1. **Someone purifies the Gan but does not have pride.**
2. **Someone has pride but does not purify the Gan.**
3. **Someone purifies the Gan and also has pride.**
4. **Someone neither purifies the Gan nor has pride.**

**Discussion:** Every individual has different qualities. Therefore, five categories have been mentioned for the restrained individuals, considering these differences. They include the following topics:

1. **Atta:** Any service work.
2. **Gan?:** Work related to the organization of the Gachchha.
3. **Ganasangrah:** Increasing the number of Sadhu-Sadhvi, Shravak-Shravika in the Gan, making food, water, clothes, utensils, bedding, and other necessities easily available, increasing the number of such areas, and fostering religious interest and a spirit of giving in people.
4. **Gansoha:** Enhancing the glory of the Gan through tapasya (austerity), restraint, knowledge, meditation, preaching, and skillful conduct.
5. **Gansohi:** Removing the impurities in the conduct and behavior of Sadhu-Sadhvi or Shravak-Shravika with wisdom. Correcting the disorder in the Sangha organization through appropriate measures and establishing a better system.

These qualities and pride have been related to each other in the description of these categories. Some Sadhus, even after performing the aforementioned tasks for the Gan, do not have pride. Such Sadhus are the best. Every seeker should strive to live according to this first category. The second category is completely inferior and despicable for the soul. Because doing nothing and having pride is completely inappropriate. The third category is moderate, meaning it is not as harmful to the soul as the second category, and it is natural for such behavior to occur in beings who are in a state of delusion. Pride in work during spiritual practice is also a vice. It does not lead to the development of spiritual qualities. The fourth category is compared to ordinary Sadhus. It has neither qualities nor vices. Such monks can focus on their own worship if they are careful in their restraint, but they are not active in the work of the Gan. Therefore, those in this category do not perform many virtuous actions, and they do not have significant karma-bondage or loss of merit.

By contemplating these categories and examining oneself, one should develop the power of the soul in a purer and purer state. That is, one should contribute to the benefit of the Gachchha and the influence of Jainism according to one's capacity for overcoming karmic obstacles. At the same time, one should maintain a sense of humility in the soul and avoid self-exaltation and the contempt and criticism of others. Because the primary goal of spiritual practice is to achieve the cessation of passions and peace of mind. The opposite of this is the increase of the passion of pride.

## The 8th Uddeshak [445]

No action yields good results, only bad ones. Therefore, it is essential to be mindful.

**Fourfold Classification of Individuals (based on their adherence to Dharma)**

**1. Based on Form (Rupa) and Dharma:**

* **Type 1:**  One who abandons form (external appearance) but not Dharma.
* **Type 2:** One who abandons Dharma but not form.
* **Type 3:** One who abandons both form and Dharma.
* **Type 4:** One who abandons neither form nor Dharma.

**2. Based on Dharma and Community (Ganasanthis)**

* **Type 1:** One who abandons Dharma but not the community's principles.
* **Type 2:** One who abandons the community's principles but not Dharma.
* **Type 3:** One who abandons both Dharma and the community's principles.
* **Type 4:** One who abandons neither Dharma nor the community's principles.

**3. Based on Love for Dharma (Piyadhamma) and Firmness in Dharma (Dhadhamma)**

* **Type 1:** One who is attached to Dharma but not firm in it.
* **Type 2:** One who is firm in Dharma but not attached to it.
* **Type 3:** One who is both attached to and firm in Dharma.
* **Type 4:** One who is neither attached to nor firm in Dharma.

**Discussion:**

These fourfold classifications describe the different levels of a seeker's adherence to Dharma. They discuss:

1. External appearance (Rupa) and Dharma.
2. Dharma and the community's principles (Ganasanthis).
3. Love for Dharma (Piyadhamma) and firmness in Dharma (Dhadhamma).

The first classification highlights that some individuals, regardless of the situation, never abandon their Dharma and external appearance. They navigate challenging circumstances with unwavering commitment. This represents the highest state of a seeker's soul.

Others, overwhelmed by fear, abandon their external appearance and adherence to principles, but maintain their Dharma and faith. Such seekers may miss out on spiritual progress but are not destined for a bad fate.

##  Translation:

**[446]** Some abandon the *Dharmabhava* (religious sentiment), meaning they give up the practice of *Samyama* (self-control) and the pacification of *Kshayas* (passions), but they do not abandon the *Sadhuvesha* (robe of a monk). Many practitioners abandon both when faced with circumstances. These three types are considered *Bhanga* (fallen) and have deviated from the path. However, a practitioner with two *Bhanga* can still be a devotee of *Dharma*. In this *Chaubhangi* (fourfold classification), the practitioner with four *Bhanga* is the worst.

The second *Chaubhangi* with four *Bhanga* states that many practitioners, regardless of circumstances, do not deviate from the *Pragamasamachari* (follower of the ancient tradition) or *Gachchasamachari* (follower of the current tradition) but adhere to the *Sampoorna Samachari* (complete follower) with firmness and discernment. They are the best practitioners. The remaining three *Bhanga* practitioners are considered less successful. They deviate from some *Samachari* due to circumstances. These *Bhanga* combinations should be understood similarly to the previous *Chaubhangi*.

The third *Chaubhangi* discusses the firmness in *Dharmacharana* (practice of *Dharma*) and the inner love for *Dharma*. *Dharmaddhata* (firmness in *Dharma*) indicates a steady mind and seriousness, while *Dharmaprema* (love for *Dharma*) is related to deep faith or devotion. Some practitioners possess both qualities, some possess one, and some lack both or have them in a weakened state.

**Summary:** In the first *Chaubhangi*, the fourth *Bhanga* is the worst. In the second *Chaubhangi*, the fourth *Bhanga* is also the worst. In the third *Chaubhangi*, the third *Bhanga* is the worst.

**Types of Acharyas (Teachers) and Shishyas (Students):**

**12.** There are four types of *Acharyas*:

1. *Pavaavana Acharyas* (purifying teachers) but not *Uvadhavana Acharyas* (awakening teachers).
2. *Uvadhavana Acharyas* (awakening teachers) but not *Pavaavana Acharyas* (purifying teachers).
3. Both *Pavaavana Acharyas* (purifying teachers) and *Uvadhavana Acharyas* (awakening teachers).
4. Neither *Pavaavana Acharyas* (purifying teachers) nor *Uvadhavana Acharyas* (awakening teachers) - *Dharma Acharyas* (teachers of *Dharma*).

**13.** There are four types of *Shishyas*:

1. *Uddesa Shishyas* (students who receive instructions) but not *Vayana Shishyas* (students who study).
2. *Vayana Shishyas* (students who study) but not *Uddesa Shishyas* (students who receive instructions).
3. Both *Uddesa Shishyas* (students who receive instructions) and *Vayana Shishyas* (students who study).
4. Neither *Uddesa Shishyas* (students who receive instructions) nor *Vayana Shishyas* (students who study) - *Dharma Shishyas* (students of *Dharma*).

**14.** There are four types of *Antevasis* (residents of a monastery):

1. *Pavaavana Antevasis* (purifying residents) but not *Uvadhavana Antevasis* (awakening residents).
2. *Uvadhavana Antevasis* (awakening residents) but not *Pavaavana Antevasis* (purifying residents).
3. Both *Pavaavana Antevasis* (purifying residents) and *Uvadhavana Antevasis* (awakening residents).
4. Neither *Pavaavana Antevasis* (purifying residents) nor *Uvadhavana Antevasis* (awakening residents) - *Dharma Antevasis* (residents of *Dharma*).

**15.** There are four types of *Antevasis* (residents of a monastery): 

Page #267:

## Tenth Uddeshak [447]

1. Some are Uddeshan-antevasi but not Vayana-antevasi.
2. Some are Vayana-antevasi but not Uddeshan-antevasi.
3. Some are both Uddeshan-antevasi and Vayana-antevasi.
4. Some are neither Uddeshan-antevasi nor Vayana-antevasi, but only Dharma-antevasi.

**Explanation:**

These four categories describe the relationship between the guru and the disciple in the following aspects:

1. Guru who gives Diksha (initiation) and the disciple.
2. Guru who gives Badi Diksha (higher initiation) and the disciple.
3. Guru who teaches the original text of the Agam and the disciple.
4. Guru who teaches the meaning of the Sutras and the disciple.
5. Guru who gives enlightenment and the disciple.

It is not necessary for a specific Acharya (teacher), Upadhyaya (preceptor), or any other Shraman (monk) or Shramani (nun) to be responsible for giving Diksha, Badi Diksha, or enlightenment to a disciple. Any of them can do so under the guidance of the Guru. 

Page #268:
---------------------------
[448] The *Vyavahar Sutra* can grant *Deeksha*, *Badi Deeksha* or *Pratibodh* / They are indicated by the term "Ayari" in this Sutra. Similarly, the disciple is also indicated by different terms / The same monk can perform all the five aforementioned tasks of *Deekshadata* etc. or he can be the doer of some lesser or greater tasks, and some monks are also ordinary monks who are devoid of all five states, i.e., they have a different state / The monks who perform all the five tasks are indicated by the term "Prayari" in the first two *Chaubhangis* and their disciples are indicated by the later two *Chaubhangis*. Thus, these *bhangs* of these *Chaubhangis* are only knowable, i.e., no *bhang* of these *Chaubhangis* can be called praiseworthy or unpraiseworthy. Types of *Sthavir* 16. *Tamo Therabhuminono Pannatao*, *Tan Jaha*-1. *Jai-There*, 2. *Suy-There*, 3. *Pariyay-There*. 1. *Sattivasajae Samane Nigganthae Jai-There* / 2. *Than-Samavayanga-Dhare Samane Nigganthae Suy-There*. 3. *Vivasavas-Pariyae Samane Nigganthae Pariyay-There*. 16. *Sthavir* are said to be of three types, namely-1. *Vay-Sthavir*, 2. *Shrut-Sthavir*, 3. *Paryay-Sthavir* / 1. *Shraman-Nirgranth* who are 60 years old, including the time spent in the womb, are *Vay-Sthavir*. 2. *Shraman-Nirgranth* who are the holders of *Sthanang* and *Samavayang* are *Shrut-Sthavir*. 3. *Shraman-Nirgranth* who are the holders of *Vivasavas-Pariyay* for twenty years are *Paryay-Sthavir*. Discussion-The word "Bhoomi" is used here in the sense of "state" / Those who become stable in nature are not incomplete or fickle / Therefore, they are called *Sthavir* / (1) In the *Vay-Sthavir* Sutra, those who are 60 years old, including the time spent in the womb, are indicated as *Vay-Sthavir* and in *Vyav. Bhashya Udde 3 Sutra 11*, a 70-year-old is called *Sthavir*. There, the previous state is called the adult state / These two statements are relative, they should not be understood as contradictory / (2) *Shrut-Sthavir*-One who has memorized the *Sthanang* and *Samavayang* Sutras, i.e., one who has memorized the four *Angas*, four *Chhed* and *Uttaraadhyayayan*, *Dashavaikalik* and *Aavashyak* Sutras with their meanings, is called *Shrut-Sthavir* in terms of *Shrut-gyan*. (3) *Paryay-Sthavir*-A monk is called "Paryay-Sthavir" after completing twenty years of *Sanayam-Paryay*. These three types of *Sthavir* are independent of each other, i.e., they are independent. In this Sutra, these three types of *Sthavir* are mentioned in relation to the *Sadhu-Sadhvi*.

[Vasavaan Uddeshak] The commentary explains how one should behave towards these elders. (1) One should provide food to the Janmasthavir according to the time and nature, give him a suitable title, bedding, and bedding materials, i.e., a place with ventilation and a soft bedding according to the season, and show compassion by carrying his equipment and water in the monastery, etc. / (2) One should show respect and honor to the Shruthasthavir, rise to greet him, perform services, offer him a seat, wash his feet, praise him directly or indirectly, not sit on a higher seat in his presence, and act according to his instructions. / (3) One should show respect and honor to the Paryayasthavir, rise to greet him, bow to him, offer him Khamasamana, accept his staff and other equipment, and show proper humility. / These elders are the wealth of the community. To disrespect them, show them disaffection, etc., is a cause of Viradhana, and by doing so, one incurs the Guruchaumasi Pratikramana. The time limit for giving the Great Initiation is 17. There are three Shaiksha-Bhoomis for the newly initiated disciple, namely: 1. Saptratri, 2. Chaturmasik, 3. Panmasiki. The best is to initiate into the Mahavrata after six months. / The medium is to initiate into the Mahavrata after four months. / The worst is to initiate into the Mahavrata after seven days and nights. The intermediate state between the initiation and the Upasthapana is called Shaiksha-Bhoomi. The worst Shaiksha-kal is seven days and nights, so the Great Initiation can be given after at least seven nights have passed, i.e., on the eighth day. Other discussions related to Upasthapana are in Vyav. Uddeshak 4 Sutra 15. The medium and best Shaiksha-kal may be due to the non-completion of Pratikramana and Samachari studies, or it may be due to the presence of some honorable and respected person who is being initiated at the same time. The worst Shaiksha-kal is necessary for everyone. In this time, many intimate things are learned, testing is done, and knowledge of Pratikramana and Samachari can be completed. There is also a tradition of giving the Great Initiation on the seventh day due to some expectation, but according to the sutras, it is not proper to give the Great Initiation before seven nights have passed. See U. 4 Su. 15 for a special discussion on this topic.

**450] [Vyavahar Sutra: The Method and Prohibition of Giving the Great Initiation to Boys and Girls] 18. It is not proper for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to give the great initiation to a boy or girl who is less than eight years old, or to eat with them. 19. It is proper for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to give the great initiation to a boy or girl who is more than eight years old, or to eat with them.**

**Discussion:** In the previous Sutra, the statement of the Shaiksha-bhoomi was said to be the time of initiation, and here the statement of the Ksullaka-Ksullaka, that is, the initiation of a young boy or girl, has been made. If, for some reason, a young boy is initiated with his parents, etc., then the great initiation should not be given before the age of eight years, including the gestation period, that is, nine years. After this time has been completed, the great initiation can be given. Generally, the initiation should not be given before this age. Therefore, this Sutra-stated initiation ordinance is expected to be in exceptional circumstances. Or, it can also be understood that both initiation and great initiation are indicated by initiation. It is natural for a very young child to be unstable and restless, and it is possible for him to lose his composure due to situations like being stubborn, crying, playing, and urinating and defecating without discretion. For this reason, there is a prohibition and atonement ordinance for giving initiation or great initiation before the age of nine years. The verb "sanbhujitte" is also in the Sutra, which means that a newly initiated Sadhu cannot be given a Mandalik meal before initiation. Because until then he is a Samayikcharitra. After the great initiation, he becomes a Chhedopasthapaneya charitra. It should be understood that it is a rule to eat a Mandalik meal with him.

**20. It is not proper for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to teach a boy or girl who is less than eight years old the name of the Acharaprakalpa. 21. It is proper for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to teach a boy or girl who is more than eight years old the name of the Acharaprakalpa.**

36. A Shraman-Nirgranth with a 20-year Dikshaparaya becomes capable of holding the Sarvasruta. 

**Discussion:** These fifteen sutras describe the study of Agamas in relation to the Dikshaparaya, covering the period from three to twenty years. This study sequence is based on the Shruta available during the time of the author of this sutra, Shri Bhadrabahu Swami. Later composed and established sutras are not mentioned in this study sequence. Therefore, the study sequence of the 12 Upangasutras like Uvvai, etc., and the Malasutras is not discussed here. However, after studying Pracharashastra, i.e., after studying the Chedasutras, and before or after studying the Thanang, Samavayang, and Bhagavati Sutra, one should understand that the study of those remaining sutras can be done at any time. The study of the Aavashyakasutra is done before the Upasthapana, and the Bhashya instructs to study the Dashavakalik and Uttaraadhyayana Sutra before Pracharang and Nishita. The relevant quotations have been given in the third Uddeshak, and Nishita U. 19 discusses this topic. 

1. There is a belief regarding the Dashavakalik Sutra that Shayambhav Swami composed this sutra for his son "Manak" before Bhadrabahu Swami. Then, at the request of the Sangha, it was not merged back into the Purvas and was allowed to remain independent. 
2. Similarly, there is a tradition regarding the Uttaraadhyayana Sutra that these 36 studies were delivered by Bhagwan Mahavira Swami in his final Deshana. At that time, a Sthavir, upon hearing the Deshana, compiled it into a sutra form. However, due to the fact that Bhadrabahu Swami did not include these two sutras in the present Agam study sequence, and upon carefully examining those historical statements, it is easily concluded that these beliefs related to these two sutras are imaginary. In reality, these sutras were compiled after Bhadrabahu Swami and sometime before the time of Devadhiggani. 

Page #274:
---------------------------
[454] There have been many speculations about the history of the Vyavahar Sutra over time. For example, it has been claimed that the Niyukti, Bhashya, and Churnis are actually texts composed by the Acharyas after the composition of the Nandi Sutra. However, these texts are known to have been composed by the 14 Eastern or 3 Eastern, etc., which are fictional accounts. The statement that two or four Chulika were brought from the Mahavideha region by the sister of Sthuli-bhadras is found in different texts like the Parishishta Parva, etc. These texts were composed 800-900 years after the time of Sthuli-bhadras. The commentators and Churnikars who came before the authors of these texts did not imagine that these Chulika were brought from Mahavideha, but accepted them as original compositions. The Paryushana Kalpa Sutra did not even have a name in the 12th-13th century. It was also propagated to have been composed by the 14th Eastern Bhadrabahu Swami, see the discussion in Dasha. Da. 8. Therefore, there is no objection to accepting that the Uttaradhyayanasutra and the Dashakalika Sutra were composed after the Vyavahar Sutra. However, if they are accepted to have been composed by the earlier Acharyas, then their absence in the study sequence of the Vyavahar Sutra is a matter of consideration, and the prevailing historical traditions on this subject are also not logical when considered. The statement of three years of Paryaya, etc., in these Sutras can be interpreted in two ways: (1) To study these Agamas after the completion of three years of Diksha Paryaya. (2) A qualified monk should study or be made to study at least these Agamas during the three years of Diksha Paryaya. The second meaning is in accordance with the Agamas, its explanation is given in the discussion of U. 3 Su. 3. The reader should understand it from there. Most of the Sutras mentioned for study after the ten years of Diksha Paryaya were available in the form of Kalika Shruta at the time of the composition of the Nandi Sutra. However, none of these Sutras are available today. Only the study called 'Teinisarga' is available in the 15th century of the Bhagavati Sutra. The Anga Sutras like the Jnata Sutra, etc., are not mentioned in the present study. The reason for this is that these Sutras mainly describe Dharmakatha, which does not require any sequence. They can be studied or taught at any time as needed. The description of Ashrava-Samvara available in the Prashnavyakaran Sutra is not composed by Gandhar, but was compiled after the composition of the Sutra. The names of the Agamas mentioned in these Sutras are as follows: (1-2) Pracharanga Sutra and Nishita Sutra, (3) Suyagada Anga Sutra, (4, 5, 6) Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Brihat Kalpa Sutra and Vyavahar Sutra, (7, 8) Thana Anga Sutra, Samavaya Anga Sutra, (9) Bhagavati Sutra.

Sutras from 10 to 29 were either part of the Anga called Drishtivad or separate Sutras derived from it. All of these are mentioned in the list of Kalikashrut in the Nandi Sutra. At the end of these Sutras, it is mentioned that one should complete the study of the entire Samputashrut within twenty years of initiation. Accordingly, even today, every eligible monk should complete the study of all available Agamashrut within twenty years. After that, one should engage in Pravachanaprabhavana or remain in Nivrittimaya Sadhana, engaging in self-realization through Swadhyaya, Dhyana, Kayotsarg, etc. The eligible disciple should be given the above Agamas in order, as described in detail in Nishi.

Here, the mention of Acharya and others encompasses all Sadhus who are eligible for Vyavavritti. This Vyavavritti is described in the Bhashya as thirteen types, namely: (1) Ahar - Bringing and giving appropriate food to the Acharya and others. (2) Pani - Searching for and bringing and giving water. (3) Shayanasan - Arranging the bed, spreading the bedding, or searching for and bringing it, and cleaning the bed area. (4) Pratilekhan - Copying and purifying the writing materials. (5-7) Bringing and giving medicines, or cleaning the feet.

## Tenth Uddeshak

**(8)**  Carrying the Upadhi (attributes) in Marg-Vihar (conduct) and other activities, and walking along with them. 
**(9)**  Removing aversion towards Rajadvist (enemies of the king) and other kings.
**(10)**  Protecting oneself from Sten (thief) and others.
**(11)**  Receiving the Danda (staff) and other objects from the hands of the Dandaggaha (guards) while entering or leaving the Upashraya (monastery). Or, receiving the Danda and other objects upon entering the Upashraya.
**(12)**  Taking care of the Glan (sick) in various ways, inquiring about their well-being.
**(13)**  Purifying the Matrak (objects used for speech, excretion, and play) by discarding them in a secluded place.

The Bhashyakar (commentator) has explained that the term "Pracharaya" mentioned in the Sutra should be understood to include the Tirthankara as well. Because the Ganadhar Gautam Swami used the term "Dharmacharaya" for the Bhagwan (Lord). - Bhag.Sh.2, U.1 Skandhak Varnan

**Kula (lineage):** A lineage of one Guru.
**Gan (group):** A lineage of one prominent Pracharaya.
**Sangh (community):** A group of all the Gachchas (sects).

Other descriptions related to Vyavrittya (conduct) are mentioned in Uddeshak 5.

**Summary of Sutra 1-2 of the Tenth Uddeshak:**

A Shruta-Sampanna (learned) Bhikshu (monk) can perform Paradhan (offering) for the Yavamdhyachandrapratima (image with a moon in the middle of barley) and Vajramdhyachandrapratima (image with a moon in the middle of a diamond) according to the prescribed method in the Sutra. These images are for one month each. The amount of food and water offered to them is increased or decreased. Along with this, many other rules are followed, Abhigraha (acceptance) is done, and the Parishha Upsargas (trials) are endured with patience, being detached from the body.

From the five practices of Aagam (scripture), Shruta (learning), Aajna (command), Dharana (meditation), and Jit (conquest), one should use whichever is available at the time, impartially, for Prashchitta (atonement) and Tattva Nirnay (realization of truth). One should not use them in reverse order due to selfishness, insistence, or neglect. This means that one should not give more importance to Dharana alone, but prioritize the rules and prohibitions of the Aagams.

There are five Chaubhangis (fourfold classifications) regarding performing Seva Karya (service) and Gan Karya (group work) and showing respect or not. There are two Chaubhangis regarding those who remain steadfast in Dharma (religion), Prachar (conduct), and Ganasamachari (group conduct), or those who abandon them. 

Page #278:
---------------------------
458 [Vyavahar Sutra 11 12-15 18-19] This is a four-fold classification regarding Dridhdharmi and Priyadharm. The Dikshadata, the Big Dikshadata, the reader of Mula-Pagam, the reader of Artha-Agam, and their respective disciples are said to be four such classifications, and with their final bhang, the Dharmacharaya (Pratibodhadata) etc. are mentioned. There are three types of sthavira. The Shaiksha has three stages before the Upasthapana. / One should not give Diksha to anyone before the age of 9 years, including the time spent in the womb. / If Diksha is given due to some reason, then one should not give the Big Diksha. One should not give the reading of Pracharang-Nishith to the Avyakt (those under 16 years of age), but should make them study other things. One should complete the reading of the Sutra-Ukt Agams to the eligible disciples until the age of 20 years, which is the Dikshaparaya. One should perform the Bhava-yukt Vyayavritti of the Pracharya etc. ten. / Through their Vyayavritti, there is a great reduction in karmas and attainment of liberation. 20-21 22-36 Upasanshar 1-2 4-15 In this Uddeshak, there is a mention of two Chandra-Pratimans, five Vyavahars, many Chaubhangis, types of Sthavira, stages of Shaiksha, the rules and prohibitions of Baldiksha, the order of Pragam-study, Vyayavritti, etc. // Tenth Uddeshak ends // 18-19 20-36

##  Anadhyāyakāla [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra, compiled by Ācārya Pravara Śrī Prātmārāmji Mahārāja]

One should study the scriptures only during the time prescribed in the Āgamas for study.  Study during Anadhyāyakāla is prohibited.  The Manusmṛti and other Smṛtis also describe Anadhyāyakāla in detail.  The Vedic people also mention the Anadhyāyas of the Vedas.  Similarly, other Ārya scriptures are also considered to have Anadhyāyas.  Since the Jain Āgamas are also Sarvajñokta, Devādhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā combined, their Anadhyāyakāla is also described in the Āgamas, such as:

**Ten Ākāśa-related Anadhyāyas:**

1. Ukkāvāte (Meteor shower)
2. Disidāghe (Fiery sky)
3. Gajjite (Thunder)
4. Nigdhāte (Lightning)
5. Juvate (Earthquake)
6. Jakkhālitte (Strong wind)
7. Dhūmita (Smoke)
8. Mahita (Fog)
9. Rayugghaate (Heavy rain)
10.  Asajjhāye Paṇṇatte (Unfavorable time)

**Ten Audārika Śarīra-related Anadhyāyas:**

1. Aṭṭhi (Bones)
2. Maṁsaṁ (Flesh)
3. Soṇitte (Blood)
4. Asūtisāmante (Death)
5. Susāṇasāmante (Cemetery)
6. Candovārāte (Lunar eclipse)
7. Sūrovārāte (Solar eclipse)
8. Paḍane (Fall)
9. Rāyavugghe (War)
10. Uvassayassa Anto Orālie Sarīrage (Death of a body)

**Four Mahāpratipadā Anadhyāyas:**

1. Āsāḍhapratipadā
2. Indamahāpratipadā
3. Kattiyapratipadā
4. Sugimhapratipadā

**Four Mahāpratipadā Pūrṇimā Anadhyāyas:**

1. Paḍimāte (Full moon of Āsāḍha)
2. Pacchimāte (Full moon of Kārttika)
3. Majjhaṇe (Full moon of Māgha)
4. Aḍḍharatte (Full moon of Vaiśākha)

**Four Sandhyā Anadhyāyas:**

1. Puṭavaṇe (Dawn)
2. Avaraṇe (Sunset)
3. Panose (Morning)
4. Pacchūse (Evening)

According to the above Sūtra-pāṭha, thirty-two Anadhyāyas are considered: ten Ākāśa-related, ten Audārika Śarīra-related, four Mahāpratipadā, four Mahāpratipadā Pūrṇimā, and four Sandhyā.

**Brief Description of Anadhyāyas:**

**1. Ukkāvāte (Meteor shower):** If there is a major meteor shower, one should not study the scriptures for one prahara (three hours).

**2. Disidāghe (Fiery sky):** One should not study the scriptures as long as the sky appears red, as if it is on fire.

## Chapter 3-4:  Unfavorable Times for Study

**1. Thunder and Lightning:** Thunder and lightning are often caused by seasonal changes. Therefore, the period from the Parda constellation to the Swati constellation is not considered unfavorable for study.

**2. Nirdhaat:** If there is a loud thunderclap in a cloudless sky, or if there is thunder and lightning in a cloudy sky, then there is an unfavorable period for study for two praharas (approximately 3 hours).

**3. Yupaka:** In the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha), the first, second, and third days are called Yupaka, when the light of the evening and the moon combine. During these days, one should not study until night.

**4. Yakshadeepta:** When there is a flash of light in a particular direction, followed by a faint light after a short interval, it is called Yakshadeepta. One should not study until the Yaksha-like light disappears from the sky.

**5. Dhumika Krishna:** From Kartik to Magh (October-February), the time is considered the gestation period for clouds. During this time, a fine, water-like mist of a smoky color falls, which is called Dhumika Krishna. One should not study until this mist stops falling.

**6. Mihika Shweta:** In winter, a fine, water-like mist of white color falls, which is called Mihika. One should not study until this mist stops falling.

**7. Raj Udghāt:** Due to wind, dust spreads throughout the sky. One should not study until the dust settles.

These ten reasons are related to unfavorable times for study due to atmospheric conditions.

**8. Audarik (Related to Living Beings):**

**9. Bones, Flesh, and Blood:** If bones, flesh, and blood of a five-sensed animal are visible, then one should not study until these items are removed. Commentators consider a radius of 60 hands (approximately 90 feet) around the location of these items as unfavorable for study. Similarly, the presence of bones, flesh, and blood of a human being is also considered unfavorable for study. However, the unfavorable period for these is considered to be 100 hands (approximately 150 feet) and lasts for one day and night.

**10. Menstruation:** The unfavorable period for study during a woman's menstruation is three days.

**11. Birth of a Child:** The unfavorable period for study after the birth of a boy is seven days, and for a girl, it is eight days.

**12. Impurity:** One should not study until the sight of excrement and urine is removed.

**13. Cremation Ground:** The area around a cremation ground, up to 100 hands (approximately 150 feet) in all directions, is considered unfavorable for study.

**14. Lunar Eclipse:** During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for eight praharas (approximately 12 hours) for a minor eclipse, twelve praharas (approximately 18 hours) for a medium eclipse, and sixteen praharas (approximately 24 hours) for a major eclipse.

**15. Solar Eclipse:** During a solar eclipse, one should not study for eight praharas (approximately 12 hours) for a minor eclipse, twelve praharas (approximately 18 hours) for a medium eclipse, and sixteen praharas (approximately 24 hours) for a major eclipse. 

Page #281:
---------------------------
[Anadhyayakala] 18. Patan - When a great king or a national leader dies, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until his cremation is completed. Or, one should perform *svadhyaya* gradually until another official takes over. 19. Rajavyudgraha - When there is a war between nearby kings, one should not perform *svadhyaya* for one day and night even after peace is restored. 20. Audarik Sharira - When a five-sense being dies within the *upaashraya*, one should not perform *svadhyaya* as long as the body remains there, and for 100 *haath* (a unit of measurement) if the lifeless body is lying there. These 10 reasons for not performing *svadhyaya* are related to the *audarik sharira*. 21.28 Four Mahotsav and Four Mahapratipada - Ashadh Purnima, Ashwin Purnima, Kartik Purnima, and Chaitra Purnima are the four *mahotsav*. The *pratipada* that comes after these *purnimas* is called *mahapratipada*. *Svadhyaya* is prohibited during these days. 29-32. Pratah Sayam Madhyahn and Ardharatri - One should not perform *svadhyaya* one *ghadi* (a unit of time) before and after sunrise, one *ghadi* before and after sunset, one *ghadi* before and after noon, and one *ghadi* before and after midnight.
