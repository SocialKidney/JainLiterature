The Jain Acharya, the head of the Tapa Gachchha, Pujya Pad Acharya Shrimad Vijay Ramchandrasuri Maharaj, had spread the flow of the preaching Ganga for eight decades, giving the essence of the Jina-Gyan to the great people of India. At the root of this was his lifelong unwavering devotion to the Agamas and other scriptures.
To perpetuate the memory of his auspiciousness, which is the seed of our heartfelt approval of his achievements and his use of the scriptures, we decided to publish the "Poo. A. Shri. Vijay Ramchandrasuri Smriti Sanskrit-Prakrit Granthmala" associated with his mantra-like name.
With the blessings of his successor, the great Gachchhadhiraj, Poo. A. Shri. Vijay Mahodya Suri Maharaj, we were able to move forward in this series. Under the patronage of the great ascetic, Poo. A. Shri. Vijay Gunayash Suri Maharaj, and with the scholarly guidance of his disciple, the preacher, Poo. A. Shri. Vijay Kirtiyas Suri Maharaj, many books on various subjects were printed by various scripture-serving monks, and now, as the 27th flower in this series, we are delighted to publish the "Shri Atupraatyakhyan Prakirnak" grantharatna.
With the grace of the supreme Yogi, Shri Arihant Prabhu, and the blessings of all the Suri-Vachan-Sadhu-Vandanas who follow his commands, and with the auspicious help of the Shasana Devas, we hope to be instrumental in the publication of more and more Agamas and other scriptures that illuminate the Samadhi Bhavana. May everyone become the master of the Yoga-Samrajya of the Supreme Arihant Devas and attain eternal happiness, Moksha.

To the most sacred lotus feet of those whose meritorious deeds of penance have resulted in the creation and compilation of this gem of a text,
**Dedication**
- From my very tender age, those who made me listen to the Shri Namaskara Maha Mantra. When I gained a little understanding, they explained to me, "What is the world? It is bitter, bitter." And, "What is liberation? It is sweet, sweet." * At the age of four, I was made to perform Ayambil, and I was made a devotee of worship, Pratikraman, Samayik, and school. 
- I dedicated myself to the lap of the vow-fulfilling, venerable, Shri Vijay Siddhisuri Maharaj (Bapuji). He firmly instilled in me the values of "We are to take Diksha." When Bapuji Maharaj passed away, he introduced me to the true heir of his ideals, the venerable, Vyākhyāna-vācaspati, Shri Vijay Rāmacandrasuriśvara Mahārāja. From birth to the end of my life... he gave me more affection than my own mother, he disciplined me strictly as a father, and as a Guru, he never shied away from fulfilling his duties as a Guru. He renounced his own interests and joined me in the service of the Supreme Gurudev... Even at the age of 86, he sat upright, enduring numerous ailments, and remained immersed in Japa-Yoga, Swadhyaya Yoga, and the Supreme Samadhi. He has ensured the uninterrupted well-being of me and my disciples.
To the lotus feet of the self-effacing, lifelong servant of the Guru's feet, the embodiment of detachment, the influencer of the twenty-four Tirthankaras, the treasure trove of the Vardhamana Tapa,
the venerable Acharya Dev Shrimad Vijay Gunayashasuri Maharaj,
I dedicate this gem of a text, the Agama - Shri Atur Pratyakhyan Prakirnakam, and feel blessed.
- Vijay Kirtiyasasuri

Guru, such a person is not found in this world, O glorious Gurudev, revered Acharyadev Shreemad Vijay Gunayashasuriswarji Maharaj!
He was the most humble disciple of the Jain Shastra Shirataj, Diksha Yug Pravartak, Tapa Gachchhadhiraj, Bhavacharya Bhagvant Shreemad Vijay Ramchandrasurisewarji Maharaj.  "Vardhaman Taponidhi" was his main title, but even though he was bestowed with the title of "Vardhaman", his life was full of "Vardhaman" qualities, which are difficult to describe. He was the revered Acharyadev Shreemad Vijay Gunayashasuriswarji Maharaj.
Bhorol Tirth, located near Tharad in the northwest corner of Gujarat, was his birthplace. This Tirth, surrounded by historical cities like Wav, Tharad, and Sanchor, was once a great city called Pippalpur Pattana or Pippalanak. The nearby Dhima Tirth was its suburb. Hundreds of wealthy merchants lived there. The city was filled with many Jain temples. With the passage of time, everything was scattered. Many statues were enshrined in the earth and continued to be worshipped by the Devas.
In VS 1961, the fortune of the Bhorol land changed when Bhagwan Shree Nemnath Prabhu appeared spontaneously. The land gradually began to prosper. The Sangha built a beautiful Jinalaya and installed the Prabhu, which led to an increase in devotion and, consequently, an increase in wealth in every household.
In VS 1980, on the auspicious day of the installation of Shree Adishwardada in Palitana, a small child was born to Sejibai on the sixth day of the bright fortnight. His father, Swaroopchand, was overjoyed to receive congratulations. The child was given the Navkar Mantra. He was taken to see and worship Dada Shree Nemnath. After spending a year or two with his father's love, when his father passed away to the heavenly abode, the child, Gagaldas, was too young to understand the situation. His uncle, Gamanchand, raised him and gave him religious education. After returning from the rainy season retreat, his uncle was bitten by a venomous snake and passed away while remembering the Namaskar Mahamantra.

## Life Story of Gurudev

Gagaldas's primary education took place at Bhorol Tirth. After becoming a young man, he decided to move to Ahmedabad. He did not want to leave the land of Bhorol and the devotion to Lord Shri Nemnath. But due to practical responsibilities, he had no other choice but to bid farewell to the Lord.

He arrived in the city and rented a place. He engaged in business with honesty and ethics. He started with selling cloth on a cart and later opened his own shop. He became respected by both traders and customers due to his honesty and open-heartedness. During this period, he continued to observe rituals like darshan-puja, guruvandana-puja-pravachan, etc. He visited various Upashrayas, listened to the discourses of every Sadhu Bhagvant, invited them home for meals, and built personal relationships to benefit from their devotion. However, his discerning eye always sought the essence of Sadhu-hood.

After visiting numerous Upashrayas in the city, his mind settled on Pujya Shri Vijay Siddhisuri Maharaj, who resided at the Vidya Shala. He saw the ideal Sadhu-hood there and mentally surrendered to him. From then on, he started following his guidance in every aspect of his life.

During this time, he married Shivavati-Rupvati, the daughter of Hakamchand Kevalchand Vohra from Rampura. His married life began. Gagalbhai's mind was less inclined towards worldly matters and more towards restraint. He performed tapas like Updhanadi, which adorn the life of a Shravak. He had already renounced sins like night meals and consumption of forbidden food.

Once, while listening to the discourse of Pujya Shri Vijay Ramchandra Suri Maharaj under the guidance of Pujya Shri Vijay Labdhisuri Maharaj, a great sage, at the request of the Nagar Seth, Gagalbhai's mind awakened. He decided on the direction of his life.

In Vikram Samvat 2006, he performed Chaturmas in Palitana. He stayed at the Agam Mandir, but with the consent of the Mahatmas there, he went to the Narsinatha Dharmshala every day to listen to the discourses of Pujya Shri Vijay Ramchandra Suri Maharaj under the guidance of Pujya Shri Vijay Premsuri Maharaj. These discourses strengthened his detachment and made him resolute. He made many decisions in his mind and wholeheartedly joined the path of tapas.

In Vikram Samvat 2008, his son Kantilal was born. He offered a Navkar mantra as a gift after his birth. His son grew up understanding. From then on, he took care not to harm his son due to mother-son attachment, kept him close, made him perform tapas, and ensured that he followed them. He also fostered a strong emotional bond between his son and Pujya Shri Siddhisuri Maharaj (Bapji). He became a guide for his son's ideal life and instilled in him a foundation of higher knowledge.

The Life Story of the Gurudev

The mind was now yearning for restraint. He asked for leave from his family. No one was ready to understand. There was a lot of opposition. Gagalbhai also started doing intense penance, renunciation and austerities to appease the opposition. He gave up ghee from the root for 12-12 years. He laid the foundation of the Vardhaman penance. He started doing penance one after another. He did only one or two austerities. He did the sixth on the cradle and beyond that, he did the ayambilos of rice-water or roti-water. This continued for years. He completely stopped the six vigais from the root. Even that took 6-6 years. The family did not give in.

Now, as a final preparation, he left his son in school. He left him in the care of Gurudev for his stay. He entrusted the responsibility of the business to his cousin brother and nephew and in the year 2023 VS, he fled from Ahmedabad in the month of Posha.

He received the support and cooperation of many well-wishers. He came to Mumbai-Murbad. Pujya Gurudev had already come there after doing vihar. He had already sent his son Kanti there. There was a five-day auspicious festival. The well-wisher families played the role of family members so well that almost no one realized that this was a secret initiation. On the 13th of Po.Su., the initiation anniversary of Pujya Gurudev was celebrated and on the 14th of Po.Su., the same Gurudev gave the initiation to his father and son. They were named Pujya Muni Shri Gunayashvijayji Maharaj and Pujya Muni Shri Kirtiyashavijayji Maharaj as his disciple and grand-disciple. He gave them hitashiksha. He explained the ultimate meaning of the given names. Both father and son, Guru-disciple munis, decided to adopt the Guru's teachings completely.

Now both of them joined the service of Pujya Gurudev. The great opposition of the family melted away due to the influence of the Guru. With joy, they took the final initiation at Bhuleshwar Lalbag, Mumbai. The father muni got engrossed in intense penance and the son muni in studies. Both of them excelled in their respective fields.

Pujya Muni Shri Gunayashvijayji Maharaj had nurtured the son muni from childhood, which was not hidden from Pujya Gurudev. Seeing that art, he started entrusting him with the mumukhsus who came to know and stay with him. He got this responsibility in just one year of paryay, which he fulfilled with great care and made the Guru's faith worthwhile. Pujya Gurudev was very satisfied. In the same way, in the initial years, he stayed in the inner circle of Pujya Gurudev and the entire burden of service, communication, etc. was placed on the strong shoulders of the father muni. He also fulfilled it with great care. Communication is not easy. Especially if you have to do the communication of such a high-level Gurudev, you need a lot of mental and physical preparedness. Pujya Munishri developed that preparedness and gave immense satisfaction to Pujya Gurudev as well as the Gachchha. Due to this quality, his self-development was rapid. He was at the forefront in penance and meditation. Now spiritual maturity,

The Life Story of Gurudev

He excelled in self-realization, self-control, and the pursuit of liberation. These qualities were naturally ingrained in him. He also studied Sanskrit. He taught many seekers and monks, while also striving to learn himself. As a result, after mastering Sanskrit, he read countless scriptures. He lived as the shadow of the revered Gurudev until the end of his life. He served in the Guru-kula for 24 years, performing selfless service. In VS 2047, on the 14th day of the waning moon in the month of Ashadh, he passed away due to the inevitable cycle of time. He was overcome with grief at the assembly of the virtuous. The separation from his Guru was not easy for him. He sought solace in the presence of the ascetic emperor, revered Shri Rajatilkasuriji Maharaj, and his elder Guru-bandhu, the Gachchhadhipati, revered Shri Vijay Mahodya Suriji Maharaj. He consoled himself by relying on the discourses of revered Gurudev in his grief. He often read the same book repeatedly. It was as if he found his lost Gurudev in the pages of those books. This became his daily routine. As soon as the first rays of light appeared, he would pick up a discourse book, and at the last rays of the evening, he would put it aside. He probably read more than anyone else!

Revered Gurudev entrusted the responsibility of many administrative tasks to his son-monk. Revered Muni Shri Kirti Yashvijayji Maharaj now also delivered daily discourses. He sat in the esteemed assembly of revered Gurudev and participated in administrative matters. In the assemblies opposing the convention, revered Gurudev entrusted him with the responsibility of delivering discourses as his representative. Revered Muni Shri Gunayashvijayji Maharaj was the protector of his son-monk. He cared for him. He also ensured his son-monk's involvement in administrative service by completing his tasks when necessary. The grace of revered Gurudev flowed continuously upon these two father-son monks like a river of blessings.

Seeing his competence, in the year VS 2050, the community's elder ascetic emperor, revered Shri Vijay Rajatilkasuriji Maharaj, and the Gachchhadhipati, revered Shri Vijay Mahodya Suriji Maharaj, adorned him with the title of Ganipada in Surat. Both devotees, who were dear to revered Bapuji Maharaj, ascended to the Ganipada in Surat, just like revered Bapuji Maharaj. The Guru-bhakts celebrated a grand festival of Jin-bhakti at that time.

Under the scholarly guidance of the father-son duo, the Shri Sangh of their ancestral home, Shri Bhorol Tirth, obtained the blessings and guidance of revered Gurudev and undertook the magnificent renovation of the Tirth's Jinalaya. Twenty-four Jinalayas were built. The consecration was also decided in VS 2051, as per the instructions given by revered Gurudev.

Life Story of Gurudev

In this festival, the elders had decided to adorn both the Ganivars with the Pannyaspad. But due to their supreme devotion to the soul, Guru devotion and community devotion, the merit generated from it suddenly changed the winds, and besides the Pannyaspad, they were decided to be adorned with the Pathka and Suri Pad Lakshmi. In VS 6, the Pannyas and Pathka degrees were attained, and when Shri Nemnathdada sat on the throne, in the auspicious time of VS 7, in the atmosphere of thousands of crowds and lakhs of rupees of offerings, both father and son were adorned with the Suri Pad. The elders gave them the advice to become those who increase the glory of the community of the revered Gurudev! They lived up to these words of advice, which were accepted by saying 'Tahatti', throughout their lives. They lived them in their own lives.

11

From the year VS 2051, the independent Chaturmasas of the son Suriji started under the guidance of Vardhaman Taponidhi Suridevshriji. Chaturmasas were held in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai and Palitana. In the remaining time, they wandered from Girnarji to Nakodaji in Rajasthan and also in the belt of Pune-Nasik in Maharashtra. They kept walking until their last strength. When the body stopped supporting them, they had to take the support of a palanquin. But their penance, renunciation, self-study, chanting and the only advice to everyone coming to renounce the world and become a monk, did not change in this. They were the ocean of affection. They were first in discipline. They would not tolerate even the smallest mistake of anyone. They would not remain without praising even the smallest virtue. In them, the legacy of their revered Gurudev had descended as a reward.

Jayna was married to him. His use was very fresh. His eyes were sharp until the last day. All five senses were intact and excellent. He did not indulge in pleasure and he did not even accept pleasure. He would only do the work he intended to do for the benefit of others.

In just 16 years of public life, 100 virtuous souls were initiated by his hand. Another 100 or so may have become renunciates through his inspiration and been initiated elsewhere! He performed the sacred installation of 70 temples. 26 virtuous souls were initiated from his family, 33 virtuous souls from villages and towns said goodbye to the world and left. Ten or so six-meal-giving groups emerged, through which a lot of influence of the religion was spread. 12 pinnacle-topped Jain temples were installed by his auspicious hand. Crores of rupees were spent in all seven fields due to his teachings. He was the main guide in big offerings. The offerings of Shri Bhorol Tirth and the Smriti Mandir installation, the offerings of Samet Shikharji Taleyti Tirth, the offerings of Lalbag Bhuleshwar Jinalaya installation, etc. are some examples that stand out.

## Life Story of Gurudev

The indication of the new renovation of Jiravala Tirth was obtained by them through the sacred Nishra obtained from their penance and chanting. They also performed Nishradaan in the Chaitri Oli at Nakoda Tirth for the first time in decades. Even in the case of an earthquake or a train accident, crores of rupees were used by them in the sacred Nishra of Shrimudgi for compassion and mercy towards living beings.

Their well-wishers remember that day. They were very eager to bring them on the right path and make them ascend the path of restraint. For this, they also wrote letters. They were constantly striving to bring worldly people out of the mire of the world. They never tired of giving direct inspiration and advice through letters.

Eight Updhana were performed in their Nishra. Approximately 5000 pious souls performed Updhana. Crores of rupees were collected at every location. Crores of rupees were donated for Hastagiri Tirth due to their teachings. They also received Nishra and guidance in the construction and consecration of the 24 Deris of the 24 Jin-Ganadhar footprints, which are a giant structure, at the other fort. They had consecrated 17 statues of their beloved Gurudev.

Their love for the Lord, their eagerness for Guru Bhakti, their goal of Jayana, their blazing renunciation, their strict adherence to character, their pure faith and desire for action, their intense effort of penance even in their final years, their ardent desire for initiation of all living beings and their efforts in that direction, etc., etc., the list of their qualities is so long that even pages and pages would be insufficient to describe each quality.

They performed many great penances like Siddhitap, Shrenitap and Varshitap in their life. They performed penances like Masakshaman, Vishasthanak without any slackening. They performed 16, 10, and many Ashtayi, 100 + 23 Oli of Vardhaman Tap with special Abhigraha, and became a true Vardhaman Taponidhi by performing many small and big penances shown in the Tapavali. They spent their last rainy season in Mumbai-Lalbaug (Bhuleshwar). They came here for the protection of Baldiksha-Siddhant and the consecration of the Jinalaya here. The great work of protecting Baldiksha was accomplished in the best possible way under their guidance. The donations for the consecration also reached the sky. Now, when only a little time was left, they started to gather the stakes of life.

Their health deteriorated during the last Chaturmas. Yet, they did not give up their daily routine of worship. They were completely involved in all the worship in a very useful way. Daily Devvandana, Guru Vandana in front of the image of the benefactor Guru Bhagvant, recitation of Navasmaran etc. hymns, Suri Mantra, Samaradhana of Ganividya, recitation and meditation of Guru Dutt many Mantrapadas, constant well-being of the dependents, giving blessings of only Dharma Labh to the Shravak-Shravika class who came to see them, suitable for taking initiation

The life story of Gurudev
Writing letters to the Shravak-Shravika who were mentioned, giving them beneficial teachings and inspiration, giving various instructions to his son Suridev regarding the tasks of the reign, making an amazing plan to keep his equanimity and samadhi intact, regularly reading the discourses of his Gurudev for hours, which were a strong aid to samadhi, noting down the useful parts and recommending them to his son Suridev for enlightenment, supporting and caring for the ascetic Munivar, recommending the well-being of the Sadhvi Sangha who lived far away, etc. - he remained dedicated to these countless self-beneficial tasks.
When doctors came, he allowed them to treat him. But he would tell the doctor, "I am cooperating for my samadhi, you are doing my material treatment, I want to do your emotional treatment. When will you give your love into my hands? When will you come here?" This was his compassion. The river of compassion flowed and flowed, now it had become a roaring Ganga, now it was impatient to merge into the ocean.
The final day also arrived. Even today, Suriji completed his daily jaap from 2:30 am to 5 am. He counted the morning memories. When Prabhuji arrived, he stood up and bowed. He circumambulated Prabhuji. He bowed while standing. He offered the khamasaman to the Pujji. He studied the Samyagdarshan book. He expressed his desire to go to the lecture. He blessed his son Suriji by placing both hands on his head when he went to the lecture and after he returned from the lecture. He wrote down words of benefit.
He continued reading 'Samyagdarshan' until 12:12. Then he suddenly took a turn. His blood pressure increased. His son Suridev immediately arrived. Knowing the situation, he was treated. When the treatment did not work, he was made to listen to the supportive verses of samadhi. He made an association with the Arihant pad, just as his revered Gurudev had done, and departed towards liberation. He made an association with the Arihant pad. He became one in the sound of 'Arihante Sarane Pavjjami'. In between, he bowed his eyelids in darshan-vandana while seeing the images of Shri Shankeshwar Parshvanath Prabhu and Shri Neminath Prabhu. "Gurudev! Are you awake? The opportunity to make the worship you have done throughout your life meaningful has now arrived," etc. When asked these questions, he indicated that his ajapjap was continuing with his fingers. When an attempt was made to fan him with a fan, he instructed twice to stop the fanning. With a very equanimous mind, he became absorbed in natural samadhi and attained death at 3:20 pm. It was the day of Aso Vad 4, Thursday. His son-disciple Suriji had one hand on his head and the other hand in Gurudev's hand. The news of his death stopped the heartbeat of everyone's heart. The shock was beyond measure.

## Life Story of Gurudev

The life story of Gurudev is a testament to his unwavering dedication to the Jain faith. He lived a life of complete selflessness, inspiring countless individuals to embrace the path of Dharma. 

His passing was a profound loss for the entire Jain community. The four branches of the Jain Sangha were present in large numbers, witnessing his final moments. Dr. Shekharbhai, a medical professional, remarked that he had never witnessed such a peaceful death in his entire career.

His mortal remains were given the final rites according to the Jain tradition. His son, Suryaji, entrusted his body to the Sangha. The necessary rituals, including bathing and other ceremonies, were performed. His body was then placed in the lecture hall for the Sangha to pay their respects. The Sangha lined up to offer their final prayers.

On the day of the cremation, donations poured in. Within minutes, over three crore rupees were collected. People who had been touched by his life and his teachings showered his remains with their wealth. The final journey began at 10 am. His body, adorned with nine-peaked golden palanquin, was taken to Ban Ganga. The cremation was performed by the families of Chanpaben Jayantilal Ajbani from Dhanera and Shantilal Harilal Mehta from Bhoroltirth. His mortal remains were finally released into the cycle of existence.

Following the cremation, there were prayers and eulogies. The next day, a grand eulogy ceremony was held at the Lalbag Sangha. During this ceremony, donations were collected for the Ashtahnnika Mahotsav. Within minutes, donations were received for all eight days of the festival. The Ashtahnnika Mahotsav was celebrated from the 14th of the current year under the guidance of the revered Gurudev. Every day, the revered Gurudev and other monks delivered eulogies. The elders of the Shravak Sangha also shared their experiences and the impact of the revered Gurudev's life on them. The eulogies continued for hours, and yet, no one wanted to leave. Everyone was captivated by the stories and teachings.

To commemorate the revered Gurudev's life and his virtues, grand celebrations were held in numerous villages and cities. The Sangha members are still planning new celebrations in his honor.

The best way to pay tribute to the revered Gurudev's life is to ignite the flame of Diksha in our hearts. We should strive to embrace Diksha ourselves and inspire our families to follow the same path.

The revered Gurudev's life was an inspiration to all. He walked the path of his Gurudev, illuminating the lives of countless individuals. Before his departure, he entrusted his legacy to his successor, the eloquent and influential preacher, Pujya Shri Vijay Kirtiyas Suri Maharaj. We must now dedicate ourselves to following his teachings and seeking guidance from his successor.

## Introduction
**Chapter Introduction:**
- The teachings of the Jina, which are inspired by the Supreme Lord Shri Viravibhu and formulated by the Shri Ganadhar Bhagavants, and later compiled by the fourteen Shrutadhara sthaviras, are called Agamas. These Agamas are like powerful vehicles for crossing the ocean of Samsara. The soul who embarks on this journey once will attain liberation, the end of Samsara.

These Agamas, which are the teachings of the Lord, are divided into sections like Angas, Upangas, etc. Currently, there are 45 main Agamas. These include eleven Angas, twelve Upangas, six Cheda Sutras, four Mula Sutras, two Chulika Sutras, and ten Panna Sutras. These ten Panna Sutras are known as "Prakirnak" or "Painey".

There is a tradition regarding the Panna texts that they are a collection of parts of the Shruta Ganga that flowed from the mouth of the Lord Vira, compiled by each of the Lord's disciples who were initiated by him. In the reign of each Tirthankara, all the disciples initiated by that Tirthankara create Prakirnak texts, this is considered a definite order. (The ten Payagra texts included in the 45 Agamas, the first was Shri Chatuh Sharan Prakirnak. Its publication with various commentaries has already been done by us.

The second in order is "Atur Pratyakhyan Prakirnak". It would be inappropriate to give a general introduction to this Prakirnak.

Its author is Shri Virabhadra, an Acharya Maharaj, a disciple of the Lord Vira, who was initiated by him. Following in the footsteps of the Ganadhar Bhagavants, he has made a commendable effort to spread the teachings of the world teacher, Bhagwan Shri Mahaviradeva.

## Introduction
17
This Agam text, composed by the disciples of Lord Mahavira, is over 2500 years old in terms of its creation. This Agam text has been a source of solace for countless seekers since the time of the Kevaljnani, Chaudaspurvi, and Sutrakar Paramarshis who existed during that time. It has been a tool for Samadhi Sadhana.
66
The Prakrit name of this Agam is "Arpavvyavasthaal Padvayan", which is known as "Turapratyagyanprajinm" in Sanskrit. Nandi Sutrakar Maharshi explains the etymology of this name, stating:
**
"Aturah Chikitsyakriyavyapetasya Pratyakhyanam Yatraadhyayane Vidhipurvakamupavarnyate Tadaturapratyakhyanam {"
When the auspicious moments of death are present before one's eyes, and the seeker has no opportunity to perform physical treatment, and only has to accept death with equanimity, then 'Atura' is manifested. Such a seeker who becomes 'Atura' is called 'Atura'.
The seeker in the 'Atura' state, after accepting the four refuges, acknowledging their misdeeds, and approving their good deeds, renounces all attachments without any guilt. This renunciation (special rule) is called 'Atura Pratyakhyan'. This Agam describes this very subject, hence this Prakirnak is called 'Atura Pratyakhyan Prakirnak', a synonym.
66
At the beginning of the text, the Maharshi, the author, did not create a new independent Mangalacharan, but instead used the Mangalacharan he had done in his own composition, the Shri Chatuhsharan Prakirnak Agam. This suggests a direct connection between the Chatuhsharan Prakirnak and the Atura Pratyakhyan Prakirnak.
From another perspective, the form of 'Balpanditmaran', which is the essence of the Jina's teachings, is shown in the first verse. This also serves as a Mangalacharan that indicates the subject matter. The soul that has right faith, who has accepted the Deshaviriti Dharma, the death that such a seeker attains with Samadhi is called 'Balpanditmaran'. The author begins the text by mentioning this in the first verse.
Along with the text
The Deshaviriti Dhar Shravak is free from all restraints, hence he is partially a child, and because he is partially restrained, he is partially a scholar. In this way, the understanding of the twelve vows of the Shravak who is in the Bal-Pandit state, formed by the combination of the two words 'Bal' and 'Pandit', is clarified from verse 2 to verse 5.
In verses 6 and 7, the special Akshardeha given to Balpanditmaran is described. The seeker who is not yet liberated due to the hope of living, who has not yet performed the final rites, and whose doorstep is met by unexpected death, such a Vratdhari Shravak sits in his own home in a state of Santhara and experiences this type of death.

**Introduction**

This text accepts the three types of *shalya* (afflictions) that a *shravak* (lay follower) should remove. It also criticizes past sins and accepts the *bal-pandit* death. This text briefly explains the *bal-pandit* death ritual. For a detailed explanation of this death, the author recommends his own work, the *Bhakt Parijna Prakiranak* (Discourse on the Knowledge of Devotees). The information presented in the original verses clearly indicates that either the author composed the *Bhakt Pariksha Prakiranak* (Discourse on the Examination of Devotees) before the *Atur Pratyakhyan Prakiranak* (Discourse on the Eager Renunciation), or he incorporated the content of the *Bhakt Pratyakhyan Prakiranak* while composing the *Atur Pratyakhyan Prakiranak*.

Up to verse 8, the text discusses the definition of *bal-pandit* death, the *swami* (spiritual guide), and the ritual. Then, in verse 9, it describes the fruits of this death, stating that the soul who practices *bal-pandit* death attains the *kalpoppan* (divine) *vaimanik* (celestial) realm as an immediate fruit. As a long-term fruit, it achieves liberation in seven births, starting from the highest realm.

From the latter half of verse 10 onwards, the text begins discussing *pandit-pandit* death, which concludes in verse 71, along with the end of the text. Thus, this *prakiranak* primarily focuses on elaborating the form of *pandit-pandit* death.

## 

In verse 11, the *sadhu* (monk) who is present for the *anashan* (fasting) is of the *pandit* class. He renounces the past sins, *agan nivaami*. He controls his current sinful activities, *pattu-bunu samvaremi*. He renounces future sins, *gala-ma pavya-vswami*. He apologizes for the transgressions, *atikram*, *vyatikram*, *atichaar*, *anaachar*, etc., that occurred in his virtues like vows, due to the 63 types of *durdhyan* (delusions) arising from the unconscious state of mind. The author uses aphoristic style to explain this. The mention of 63 types of *durdhyan* is a unique feature of the *Atur Pratyakhyan*, not found elsewhere. To understand the nature of these *durdhyan*, commentators have provided examples and named them.

Later authors have incorporated these names into verses. Some authors have even included the entire topic of 63 *durdhyan* from this text into their own works.

Various inauspicious emotions arise in the minds of beings bound by *moha* (attachment). The author has linked each of these inauspicious emotions, arising due to time, nature, karma, or cause, to the 73 *durdhyan* described here. Knowing these 63 *durdhyan* serves as a foundation for every practitioner to identify and eliminate their polluted mental states.

On this occasion, I feel compelled to mention that I encountered this *prakiranak* and the 63 *durdhyan* during my pilgrimage to the holy site of Shankeshwarji. At that time, our mental state, residing in the mind of the author, the great sage,

##  Preface

The power of recognition has been revealed. This great soul, who lived 2500 years ago, has collected the inauspicious emotions that arise in all of our minds. As I read, I felt immense joy. Later, during the Upadhanatapas organized at the Shri Sankheshwar Mahatirth, it was decided to take the subject of 63 Durdhyan as the topic of the lecture for the devotees of Upadhanatapas. The lectures given during those days and the reflections that followed touched my soul. On that occasion, the opportunity I received to purify my own mind and the minds of many others, the grace of the author, the great sage, is still remembered.

## 19

The Shraman Bhagavants, who are committed to accepting the ultimate truth, the Anashan, and who embrace death, are called Pandit Pandit Maran. The devotee who worships Pandit Pandit Maran is known as a "Kshapak". At the end of their life, the Gitaarth Guru Bhagavant recites the worship of the Kshapaks who have passed away before them.

The Kshapak, who is ready for Anashan, first salutes the Tirthankara Paramatama, from Yugaadinath Shri Rishabhdev to Charamtirthapati Shri Mahaviraswami. Then, he salutes the Ganadhar Bhagavants, like Shri Pundarik Swami, who are the masters of the second intellect.

After accepting the four refuges, acknowledging the Duskrutgah and approving the Sukrut, the devotee remembers the five Mahavratas that he has followed throughout his life.

He rejects the sources of sin like violence, etc.
He develops a feeling of friendship towards all beings.
He abandons hatred and seeks forgiveness from all beings.
He makes the state of Samadhi more stable.
He abandons many faults like the four types of dietary practices, ten Sanjnas, three Garvas, sixteen Kashayas, etc.
He makes a vow that the worship of Virati Dharma done so far and the acceptance of Papnivritti at the end will lead to liberation in the future life.

He salutes the Siddha Bhagavants who have attained liberation and the Arihant Paramatama who shows the path to liberation, with devotion.
He has faith in the path of truth shown by the Tarak Tirthankaras.
The Kshapak, who accepts the Nirpavad Anashan, once again rejects sins and accepts the Niratichar Anashan.

##  Preface

- Renounces external and internal possessions, - Cleanses the body, including food, with mind, speech, and body, - Completely renounces attachment to the body, - Renounces the results of passions, aversions, joy, sorrow, humility, eagerness, attraction, and aversion, which arise from the fruition of karma, - Renounces improper actions, inauspicious thoughts, and impure consequences, and contemplates auspicious thoughts. - Embraces the path of liberation, which is characterized by right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.

While contemplating the essence and meditating, the seeker, with a feeling of oneness, contemplates, "O soul! You came alone into this existence from the previous birth, you were born alone here, and you will die alone from here, taking karma with you to the next world. If you go free from karma, you will also go alone to liberation. All feelings other than the true nature of the soul are created by association and are subject to separation. These associations are the creators of the chain of suffering. Therefore, I now renounce all associations." - I condemn the sins of the past and reject them in the future. I reveal all my sins to the Guru Bhagvant with the simple heart of a small child. I also apologize for any wrong words spoken to the Guru Bhagvant, who is the critic and the one who grants atonement.

In this way, the seeker remembers the three types of death described in verses 12 to 35, as shown by the Pak Jinendra Bhagvant, who purifies his soul through worship and strengthens it with the feeling of samadhi. The Tirthankaras have described three types of death: 1) Bal Maran, 2) Bal Pandit, 3) Pandit Maran (Pandit Pandit Maran).

The seeker contemplates the nature of the beings who attain each of these deaths and the fruits they receive. With this contemplation, the seeker progresses further in worship from the 30th verse.

Beings who are intoxicated by the eight vices, whose minds are corrupted by the right path, and who have crooked consequences, attain Bal Maran. These beings, who oppose death, attain a terrible state similar to hell, even though they may attain the status of a god in the next life. They become difficult to teach and ultimately become eternally bound to the cycle of birth and death. Souls who are engrossed in false beliefs, who do not understand the relationship between the present and the next life, who are attracted to inauspicious actions, who are disrespectful to the Guru, and who are lax in their conduct, never attain samadhi at the time of death.

##  Proposing
This discourse considers the fruit of the death of a learned soul, who is immersed in right knowledge, free from the control of the heavens or the underworld, and is affected by the auspiciousness of the soul. Such a learned soul attains death and becomes easily enlightened in the next life. - Those who are committed to following the teachings of the Jinas, who accept the teachings of the Guru with all their heart, who follow pure and non-violent conduct, and who have an unattached mind, become short-lived. They become participants in liberation and salvation.

Influenced by these thoughts, such a soul addresses itself, saying, "O soul! Until today, you have died countless times in the fourteen realms due to untimely death. Today, a good opportunity has come, so you, who are endowed with knowledge and insight, should prepare for a learned death!"

Such a soul, disciplining itself, thinks, "The suffering that arises at the time of death, you yourself are the cause of it. No one else is causing you pain. You have experienced far greater suffering in the world countless times, compared to these. What are these sufferings in comparison? Now, there is no need to desire food in the suffering of hunger. Because, for an infinite time, you have consumed every particle as food. But if you are still not satisfied with it, then what satisfaction will you gain from a small amount of food and other things? Just as fire is never satisfied with grass and wood, and the salt sea is never filled by thousands of rivers, so too, the embodied soul is never satisfied with food."

By giving the example of such a soul, the Guru prepares the present soul for a peaceful death. The fruit of this fasting, which is like a flood of nectar, is liberation. Liberation is free from the cycle of birth and death, free from attachment, disease, and delusion, and free from all suffering like illness, sorrow, hunger, and thirst. By showing the beauty and greatness of the fruit in this way, the Guru increases the enthusiasm of the soul.

The present soul accepts with the same faith the description of the form of the previous souls and the fruit of peaceful death, as heard from the mouth of the Guru.

From verse 59 onwards, the author writes that even those who have attained the level of the fourteen previous realms, who have a strong mind, and who are mature, are not fully capable of contemplating, remembering, and repeating the twelve angas.

Therefore, at the end, the seeker who becomes stable in a single verse, which is extremely affected by the great mantra of salutation to the five supreme beings, makes death peaceful. As a result, he attains liberation in a maximum of three births. Knowing this well, such a soul becomes very adept at the verses of salutation to the five supreme beings and attains a learned death. In conclusion, such a soul, who is fearless, brave, virtuous, patient, and calm, moves rapidly towards liberation.

## Introduction

In the concluding verse 71, the author, the great sage, has prayed to the glorious Veer Paramatma for the destruction of all suffering of all beings. The initial moments of research...

The disciple of the learned Shri Bodirattan V.M., Muni Shri Dharmarattanvijayji M.S., with auspicious intentions, diligently collected the unpublished literature of the four treatises, Shri Chatuhsharan, Shri Atur Pratyakhyan, Shri Rud Sarvesha Nivana, and Shri Reshi Trasansthi, from different repositories. Subsequently, he also undertook the task of collecting the variant readings, textual variations, and comparative literature based on the manuscript copies of these four treatises. The prepared material was sent to me with the auspicious wish that it should be edited comprehensively, systematically, and accurately. Since then, this work has progressed under my care.

First, the preparation of Shri Chatusharan treatise was undertaken. Due to various responsibilities, it took two to two and a half years. It was published on the auspicious day of Chaitra Sud 9, Vikram Samvat 2014. After that, the work on Shri Atur Pratyakhyan treatise was started. The intention was to publish this treatise, like the previous one, comprehensively, systematically, and accurately.

With the aim of preparing this treatise comprehensively, the manuscript copies were first examined. Several omissions and inaccuracies were observed in the manuscripts due to the mistakes of the scribes of that time. The main confusion arose when, despite the same content, different names were found as the authors in different copies. It is well known that due to poor conditions like lack of resources, famine, etc., such errors were traditionally passed down.

The photocopies of the pages of the manuscripts considered ideal and used for determining the author are included here. By looking at them, scholars will get an idea of my confusion.

## Preparation of Explanatory Literature:

At the beginning of the work, two main challenges were evident: 1- Rud Sarvesha Nivana, a large treatise, and 2- Reshi Trasansthi, a concise treatise. At the end of the manuscript copies of the large treatise, two names were found as the authors: 1- Pujya Shri Bhuvanatungsurji Maharaj and 2- Pujya Shri Somasundarsurji Maharaj. The issue of "one work and two authors" was naturally confusing. While in all the available copies of the concise treatise, the name of Pujya Shri Gunarattansurji Maharaj was found.

##  Preface

With the belief that the solution to the confusion of the author of the Brihad Avchuri will be found at the right time, the work of research was initiated. The press copy made and sent by Muni Raj Shri Dharmaratna Vi.Ma. was started to be matched with the original manuscripts. The original manuscripts were abundant with impurities and incompleteness. These manuscripts, written by scribes unfamiliar or slightly familiar with the Sanskrit language, required a lot of effort to arrange the sentences. The text that was complete in one manuscript was accepted from that manuscript, and the text that was pure in other manuscripts was accepted from those manuscripts. Leaving aside the impure and incomplete texts, the work of their interpretations and commentaries was postponed, and a press copy was prepared as pure as possible.

Four manuscripts each were made as ideal for the research of both Avchuris. The abridged Avchuri by Pujya Acharya Shri Gunaratnasuri Maharaj was published by Pandit Hiralal Hansraj Jamnagarwala in Vikrama Samvat 1979 in the name of various Payapann Avchuris. After that, it has also been published by many institutions. The abridged Avchuri was also obtained from those published manuscripts.

Moving forward from research towards editing, the necessary investigation to determine the author of the Brihad Avchuri was ongoing. As part of that investigation, the list of manuscripts from the Pune-Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was reviewed. In that eager challenge, the first and last words of one manuscript appeared unfamiliar and going in a different direction. Looking at those words, it appeared that this description was different from the two presented Avchuris. Looking at the verses of its Mangalacharan and the verses of praise at the end, the name of Pujya Acharya Bhuvanatunga Suri Ma. was found. With a sense of joy, an investigation was conducted in Pune, and a xerox copy of that manuscript was requested. That xerox copy was received after a long time. Still, there was joy in receiving it. The complete explanation had to be seen. From many perspectives, this explanation was different from both Avchuris. On the one hand, the work of transcribing it was done. On the other hand, an investigation was conducted to obtain another copy of it. The transcription was done. But another manuscript was not found. It has not been received till today. - This explanation was accepted as a Vritti and decided to be published. At the end of this Vritti, the praise of Pujya Acharya Shri Bhuvanatunga Suri Shwarji Ma. Sa. was completely clear, so this work is theirs. It became clear. At the same time, the Brihad Avchuri in the form of Root Study was accepted as the work of Pujya Acharya Shri Somsundarasuri Shwarji Maharaj. This decision was made based on the currently available literature. It has been considered that if any other manuscript is found in the future for scholars who have moved forward in the direction of literature editing-research, or if any other definite factor is found for the determination of the author, it will definitely be considered.

## Preface

After refining the text based on a single ideal, the meaning and text were decided, and a press copy was prepared. This text includes excerpts from various scriptures. The original sources of these excerpts were found and corrected as much as possible.

Comparing all three interpretations, it can be definitively said that, "First, the text was created, and then, keeping it in mind, both commentaries were created." This becomes clear when considering the author's time period and the style of the work.  Reverend Shri Bhuvanatunga Suri belonged to the Aanchalik Gachchha tradition and lived around the 13th century. While Reverend Shri Gunaratna Suri and Reverend Shri Somasundara Suri belonged to the Tapa Gachchha tradition and lived in the 15th century.

The style of the text, in terms of the intertwining of words and the clarity of the subject matter, is similar in both commentaries. However, there is a significant similarity in words and subject matter between the two commentaries. This similarity suggests that there may have been an error in the mention of the author in the intervening period. Many manuscripts have been found where the text and both commentaries are mixed.

Another possibility arises: are both commentaries separate works? Perhaps they are by the same author, and later, another person adopted the commentary with necessary changes for their own study and teaching. Without giving importance to this possibility, in this publication, all three interpretations are considered as separate works of different authors.

## Editing Style

Following the editing style adopted in Shri Chatusharana Prakirnak, this Prakirnak has been edited according to sections 1, 2, and 3. To make it easier for the reader to conduct comparative studies and provide special clarifications, section 1 includes the above-mentioned text and both commentaries. Section 2 includes over a hundred stories related to the 33 Durga, compiled from other texts, which are part of this Prakirnak. These stories help to understand the subject of Durga very well.

Section 3 includes appendices. These appendices mainly include the unknown author's Balavobodh, Bhavanuvad, the unknown author's short Atur Pratyakhyan 1 and 2, the unknown author's 13 Durbaan Katha Prakirnak, the original Prakirnak's verse in alphabetical order, etc. In addition, many verses of Shri Atur Pratyakhyan Prakirnak, along with commentary, are found in the Mulaacharagranth written by Digambariya Shri Vattakaraacharya, so it has also been included at the end.

##  Preface

**Beneficial Cause**

The contemporary song-meaning-summit, having often studied the 45 Agamas and become the master of the path-leading initiation, and even at the end of life, having studied the Shri Maranasamadhipayajna Granth, one of the 45 Agamas, and ascended to the peak of Samadhi, the self-named, the initiator of the initiation era, the Tapagachchhadhiraj, the venerable Acharya Shrimad Vijay Ramchandrasuri Maharaj, had instructed his dependent Mahatmas to contribute to the publication of the 45 Agamas with pure reading after research and editing; it is a matter of great joy for me that this effort to realize, even in part, the inner feeling of that great soul has been made through the publication of these scattered Agama texts after research. With the grace of the venerable Shriji, I hope that all the scattered texts and other Agama texts will be researched and published in this way.

This research and editing work has been done with great sincerity from the beginning by the disciple gem Muni Shri Dharmaratna Vijayji Maharaj of the Dakshinamurthi Pannyas Pravar Shri Bodhiratna Vijayji Ganivar, and the disciple gem Muni Shri Shrutitilaka Vijayji Maharaj of the scholar Acharya Shri Yogatilaka Suriji, the disciple of the Prashanta Murti Pujya Acharya Shri Vijay Jinachandra Suri Maharaj. Besides this, many seekers and institutions have contributed to the publication of this work in the way it appears today, all of which is commendable. My circle of disciples has read and corrected the proofs of this work many times as part of the capital of study. In this, Muni Shri Vivek Yash Vijayji has taken commendable advantage of Shruti-service.

**25**

Through the reading, contemplation, and reflection of this present publication, many seeker souls will make the death that has come in order or accidentally present a festival, and by the power of the supreme Samadhi, they will attain the tradition of Sadgati and attain the eternal happiness of liberation as soon as possible, this is a good wish.

Along with this, through this editing and research, the present publication has been revealed, and the theoretical purity and confirmation gained through this medium will become the cause of our supreme Samadhi, and will lead to the rapid attainment of liberation through the tradition of Sadgati, this is the same good feeling.

## Introduction to the Thaathakaara Maharshis

**Poo.Aa.Shree. Bhuvanatunga Suri Maharaj** was initiated into the Anchalgachchha tradition in VS 1216 and attained Suri-pada in VS 1234. He was a prominent Acharya in the lineage of Poo.Aa.Shree. Dharmghosh Suri Maharaj. During his lifetime, he authored numerous texts. He was a renowned scholar, having earned many titles including "Vaad-vijeta" (winner of debates). In VS 1237, he initiated a nine-year-old boy named Mahendra Kumar, who later became **Poo.Aa.Mahendra Singh Suri Maharaj** after being conferred the Acharya-pada in VS 1293. Poo.Aa.Shree. Bhuvanatunga Suri Maharaj was a prominent disciple of Poo.Aa.Mahendra Singh Suri Maharaj.

Currently, there is limited information available about his life. However, his work can be understood through the "Anchalgachchha Digdarshan" book. He authored a vast amount of literature on various subjects. His works include:

1. **Rishimandal Vritti**
2. **Chatuh Sharan Vritti**
3. **Atur Pratyakhyan Vritti**
4. **Sita Charitra**
5. **Mallinath Charitra**
6. **Atmasambodh Kulak**
7. **Rishavdev Charitra**
8. **Sansmaarak Avasuri**

The "Anchalgachchha Digdarshan" provides a detailed introduction to all these texts.

Besides his literary contributions, this great soul converted many rulers to Jainism. He was known for his mastery of mantras and played a significant role in protecting the Sangha. He once summoned Takshnaag in Junagadh in front of King Raaul Khengaar Choutha, defeating sixteen Garudi's in a debate. He also made the king vow to never engage in catching or playing with snakes for the rest of his life. This Acharya obtained a royal decree from the king, releasing one and a half lakh fishing nets and shutting down five hundred furnaces. Folklore also suggests that he demonstrated the power of mantras by summoning the idol of Adiswar Bhagwan in front of eighty-four Jati Vaniks and eighty-four Gachchha Acharyas.

In the history of Anchalgachchha, he is revered as a powerful mantra practitioner, a prominent Acharya, a master of Agamas and other Jain scriptures, and the first commentator on various texts.

**Poo.Aa.Shree. Som Sundar Suri Maharaj** of the Tapa Gachchha was a descendant of the illustrious lineage of **Poo.Aa.Shree. Jagad Uchchandra Suri Maharaj**, the first great soul of the Tapa Gachchha. (Birth: VS 1396, Initiation: VS ...).

## Introduction to the Learned Maharshis

(1404 and Acharya-pad V.S. 1420) Among the learned disciples of Shrimad, the names of the following are prominent: Pujya Acharya Shri Jnan Sagar Suri Maharaj, Pujya Acharya Shri Kulmandan Suri Maharaj, Pujya Acharya Shri Gunratna Suri Maharaj, Pujya Acharya Shri Sadhu Ratna Suri Maharaj, Pujya Acharya Shri Som Sundar Suri Maharaj, Pujya Shri Sadhu Rajgani Maharaj, and Acharya Shri Kshemkar Suri Maharaj.

Each of these disciple-gems of Shrimad has authored numerous texts. Among them, the fifth disciple-gem, Pujya Acharya Shri Som Sundar Suri Maharaj, was the most influential Maharshi of his time. He was born in V.S. 1430 in Alhadnapur (present-day Palanpur). His father's name was "Sajjan" and his mother's name was "Maldan Devi". At the tender age of seven, in V.S. 1437, he renounced the world and embraced the path of asceticism. He attained the position of "Vachan" in V.S. 1450 and in V.S. 1457, at Patan, his Gurudev, Pujya Acharya Shri Dev Sundar Suri Maharaj, bestowed upon him the Acharya-pad, established him as his successor, and made him the leader of the Tapa Gachchha. He attained Nirvana in V.S. 1499. The very senior monks have said that his soul has been reborn in a good family in the Purva Mahavideha Kshetra, in the presence of Shri Simandhar Prabhu. This mention is found in the ninth canto of the Som Saubhagya Mahakavya. He was a great sage, just as he was a great person. He was also very serious and impartial. Therefore, seekers from both his own side and the opposing side would approach him without hesitation to receive his criticism and attain purity.

Detailed information about the life of this great person can be found in the following texts: "Gurvaavali" by Pujya Acharya Shri Muni Sundar Suri (composed in V.S. 1466), "Shri Chitrakoot Mahavir Prasad Prasasti" by Pujya Shri Charitra Rati Ganik (composed in V.S. 1495), "Som Saubhagya Kavya" by Pujya Muni Shri Prati Shtha Som (composed in V.S. 1524), and "Guru Gun Ratnakar" by Pujya Shri Som Charitra Ganik (composed in V.S. 1541). During his lifetime, Shrimad composed numerous texts, including "Aradhana Ras", "Updesh Mala Balavabodh", "Yog Shastra Balavabodh", "Sadavshayak Balavabodh", "Nav Tatvadhi Balavabodh", and its commentaries, "Avshayak Nirukti Avchuri", "Sadhu Samachari Kulka", as well as numerous stotras like "Kalyan Kad", etc. Many of these texts are still available today. The present "Chatudasharan Prakirnak Avchuri" (Vritti) is also a composition of Shrimad.

In the lineage of great persons of the Jain religion, this great person, who attained a position of respect and honor through his scholarship, virtuous qualities, and other virtues, had four disciples who attained the Acharya-pad: (1) Pujya Acharya Shri Muni Sundar Suri Maharaj, (2) Pujya Acharya Shri Jay Sundar Suri Maharaj, (3) Pujya Acharya Shri Bhuvan Sundar Suri Maharaj, and (4) Pujya Acharya Shri Jin

## Introduction to the Learned Maharshis

A detailed account of this great soul's life is described in the Shri Somasaubhagya Mahakavya, the Pattavali by U. Dharmasagarji, the Guru Gun Ratnakar Kavya, the Tapagachchha Pattavali, etc. A brief account is described in the books 'Pattavali Parag', 'Tapagachchha Ka Itihas Bhag-1', etc. From these, the information has been gratefully taken here.

## The Radiant Star of the 'Somayug', Pujya Acharya Shri Gunratnasuriji Maharaj

Two eras in the bright tradition of the Tapagachchha have been particularly noteworthy from a literary perspective. One is the Somayug and the other is the Hiruyug. During the time of the Yugapradhan Pujya Acharya Shri Somasundarsuriswarji Maharaj and the Akbarasurtraan Pratibodhak Pujya Acharya Shri Hirsuriswarji Maharaj, the Shraman Sangh flourished greatly. With a definite stability and skillful discipline in matters of conduct, thought, and practice, the all-round creative activity of literature became very vigorous. Due to the creation of many noteworthy texts during the time surrounding these two great souls, the influence of Jain philosophy also attained an extraordinary height and aura.

## Pujya Acharya Shri Gunratnasuriji Maharaj, the Composer of the 'Chausarana Payajnaani Laghu Teeka', was a radiant star of the 'Somayug'. Although extensive information about him is not available, some information is available in the form of Yantra, Tantra, Chutka, or Prashasti, etc.

In texts like 'Shri Somasaubhagya Mahakavya' and 'Gurvaavali', there are many verses praising Pujya Acharya Shri Devasundarsuriji Maharaj, which also mention his influential Pattadharas. Pujya Acharya Shri Gunratnasuriji Maharaj is one of the many Pattadharas of his.

Pujya Acharya Shri Munisundarsuriswarji Maharaj, the Sahasravadhani, has given a very affectionate introduction to his Guru Bhai, Pujya Acharya Shri Gunratnasuriji Maharaj. He states that:

* He was skilled in the art of debate.
* He had won many debates.
* His fame spread far and wide.
* His mind could penetrate even the most difficult texts.
* His character was spotless.
* He had no desire to harm anyone.
* He never sought support from anyone.
* He never harbored resentment towards anyone.
* He stayed far away from falsehood.

## Introduction to the Learned Maharshis

**29**

- They were skilled in all knowledge: They were skilled teachers.
- They made their disciples proficient. They had an amazing mastery of grammar, literature, scriptures, astrology, logic, and debate. - Their brilliance was known everywhere. "There was a tremendous pursuit of knowledge. - They were always diligent.
- Their memory was unparalleled: They were the authors of many detailed texts. Looking at their texts, the praise given to them by Guru Bhai Suriji is completely justified; this is clearly evident.

Their area of activity was Gujarat and Rajasthan. There is also evidence of them performing the Anjanvidhi (consecration) of Jain statues.

There is no specific evidence available to determine their time period. However, based on the fragmented evidence available, their lifespan should be from VS 1400 to 1475. It is believed that they attained Suri-pad in VS 1442. This evidence is found in the praise of the VS 1442 edition of the Panchashaktika commentary, which mentions that they were initiated into Suri-pad along with their Guru Bhai, Pujya Shri Kulmandan Suriji Maharaj.

They composed various texts. Here is a brief introduction to some of them:

1. **Kalpantarvachya:** (Composed in VS 1457) This text describes the glory of the Paryushana festival. In addition to giving the rituals of Kalp Shravan and various stories, it also discusses and decides on many topics.

2. **Jiyaratna Samucchya:** (Composed in VS 1467) Based on the Shabdanusasan of the Kalikaal Sarvagya Pujya Shri Hemchandra Suriji Maharaj, this text was created by classifying the verbs. It gives examples and uses of the forms of verbs from all periods. It also includes praise for the lineage from Shri Sudharmaswami to their own Gurudev. This text is printed.

3. **Chatur Sharan Adi Prakirna-Avasuri:** They composed the Avasuri named "Vishampad Tippani" on the four Prakirnas: Chatur Sharan, Atur Pratyakhyan, Samsmarak, and Bhakta Parijna. The first Avasuri among them is being published here. The year of its composition is not available.

4. **Karmagranth Avasuri:** (Composed in VS 1459) Pujya Shri Devendrasuriswarji Maharaj, the second Pattalankar of the Tapa Gachchha, had created five new Karmagranths. Then Pujya Shri Chandrarshigani...

## Introduction to the Great Maharshis

Maharshis (Great Sages) of the 30th (century)

**Mahattarshriji** composed the sixth Karmagranth (text on Karma). He composed commentaries (avachuri) on all of them. All these commentaries are yet to be published.

**Kshetra Samas Aavchurn:**  Poo.A. Shri Somatilkasuriji Maharaj composed a new Kshetra Samas Granth (text on Kshetra Samas). He composed a small commentary on it in the form of Aavchurn. This text is also unpublished. A manuscript of this text is available, written in Vikrama Samvat 1480, which includes a eulogy.

**Vasotika Vitanda Vidamban Prakaran:** This chapter was composed to refute some of the views of the scholars of the Anchalgachchh. Looking at the evidence, arguments, references, and style of presentation in this text, one can see their immense mastery over the Panchaangi Siddhanta (five-fold theory) along with their knowledge of Agama, Bhashya Nirukti (commentary interpretation), Churn (summary), and Tika (commentary). This text is also known as Anchalmat Nirakaran (refutation of Anchal views).

**Pardarshan Samuchchay, Tark Rahasya Deepika Tika:**  Poo. Suri Purandar Shri Haribhadrasuriji Maharaj composed a great text called Pardarshan Samuchchay. The author composed an extensive and detailed commentary on 87 karikas (verses) of this text in six chapters, rendering a great service.

Looking at all these observations, it is clear that he was a shining star of the Soma Yug (era). Even today, the light of his brilliance is being experienced by the Jain community. We offer our repeated salutations to his life, which was rich in knowledge and other virtues.

**Exhibition**

This is a narrative of the acceptance of the three vows, as told by a disciple to his guru. It begins with salutations to all the gods, and then proceeds to describe the acceptance of the vows, the renunciation of worldly attachments, and the attainment of liberation.

The disciple says, "I am a humble disciple, and I have learned this from my guru. I will now tell you about the acceptance of the three vows. First, one must renounce all worldly attachments. This is done by meditating on the nature of reality and by practicing non-violence. Once one has renounced all worldly attachments, one can then take the vows of non-violence, truthfulness, and non-stealing. These vows are the foundation of Jainism.

The disciple continues, "The acceptance of the three vows is a great blessing. It is a path to liberation. It is a path to enlightenment. It is a path to peace.

The disciple concludes, "I am grateful to my guru for teaching me this. I am grateful to the gods for guiding me. I am grateful to all beings for helping me on my journey.

**End of Exhibition**

**Note:** The text is a summary of the Jain teachings on the acceptance of the three vows. It is not a complete or accurate representation of the Jain scriptures.

॥ Hail, hail to Shri Shankeśvara Cintamani Pārśvanātha, the bestower of the fruit of liberation desired by all. ॥
॥ I bow to the valiant one, the lord of the mountain, who is the essence of the nectar of Maya. ॥ ॥ The seed of the three worlds, the supreme seed, the seed of right knowledge, the seed of the Jina king. Where it is said, it bestows success, may that Gautama grant me my desire. ॥
॥ Hail to Shri Viravibhu, the disciple of the valiant Virabhadragani. ॥ ॥ I bow to Guru Rāmachandra eternally. ॥
॥ Aim Namah. ॥ This is the Āturapratyākhyānaprakirṇakasūtra, composed by Shri Virabhadracharya, the jewel of the disciples of the Lord Śrī Mahāvīra, which includes the commentary by Āchārya Shri Bhuvanatunga Suri of the Ānchalikagachcha, the commentary by Āchārya Shri Somasundara Suri of the Tapagachcha, and the commentary by Āchārya Shri Gunaratna Suri of the Tārkiragachcha.

"A being who dies with a partial or complete rejection of the right view, is said to be a foolish scholar in the Jina's teachings." 1.
"Having bowed to the valiant Jina, I will speak, even though I am foolish, from the mouth of my own teacher. A little discussion of the rejection of the sick." 1.
"Now, in the scriptures, the worship of the supreme deities is seen. Therefore, I think that this will be a form of upliftment in the absence of that. No, this is a separate prakirṇaka because of its specific mention. Then how is there no worship? True, worship is of three kinds, according to the mind, speech, and body. Therefore, even though it is not done verbally here, it will be done mentally and physically. And I also consider this - if this was done by Virabhadra only after studying the knowledge of devotees, then how is it known? Because of the overstatement "jo bhattaparinnae", it is clear that he has done it in the four refuges of the knowledge of devotees. So everything is well."
"Because the earth and other elements are one-sixth of the whole, the country is characterized by shaking the body and helping others. Because of its being born from a thought, it is of two kinds. One part of the country, which is shaking the body, is the form of an action born from a thought. Because of its being with or without offense, it is of two kinds. There, one who is free from killing or harming even a part of the country,

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam, Chapter 1

**He who has renounced the world and is free from the desire to harm even a single being.**

**Sammādiṭṭhi** - The vision of truth, which is the opposite of wrong views, and is characterized by faith in the principles. One who possesses this vision is called **Samyagdṛṣṭi**.

**Marījatti** - To die, to attain the fivefold state of death.

**Jo jīvoti** - The Śrāvaka Jīva (lay follower).

**Tam hoi bālapandīyamaraṇam ti** - In this doctrine, death is described in many ways. For example:

**1.** **Āvīci, Ohi, Antīya, Valāimaraṇam, Vasatṭamaraṇam, and Cha.**

**2.** **Antosalla, Tabbhava, Bāla, Tah, Paṇḍiya, Mīsa.** [Uttara. Niryu 212]

**3.** **Chaumattvamaraṇam, Kevali, Vehāṇasa, Giddhapaṭṭha, and Maraṇam.**

**4.** **Maraṇam, Bhattapariṇṇā, Iṅgiṇī, Pāova, and Gamaṇam.** [Uttara. Niyu, 213]

This is further classified into five types:

**1.** **Bālabālamaraṇam** (death of a very young child)

**2.** **Bālamaraṇam** (death of a child)

**3.** **Bālapandītamaraṇam** (death of a child who is wise)

**4.** **Paṇḍītamaraṇam** (death of a wise person)

**5.** **Paṇḍītapaṇḍītamaraṇam** (death of a very wise person)

**Explanation:**

* **Mithyādrṣṭi** (wrong view) leads to **Bālabālamaraṇam**.
* **Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi** (unwavering right view) leads to **Bālamaraṇam**.
* **Deśayater** (one who teaches) leads to **Bālapandītamaraṇam**.
* **Chhadmasthāyater** (one who is deceitful) leads to **Paṇḍītamaraṇam**.
* **Kevalin** (the liberated soul) leads to **Paṇḍītapaṇḍītamaraṇam**.

In this text, the middle term is taken as inclusive of the first and last terms, as per the **Tulādandannyāya** (principle of balance).

Therefore, the death described here as **Deśayati** is considered **Bālapandītamaraṇam** in the Jina doctrine, as the other doctrines do not mention the terms **Bāla** etc.

Since there is no complete renunciation in the other doctrines, **Bāla** refers to one who has not renounced gross violence, and **Paṇḍita** refers to one who has renounced gross violence. **Bāla** and **Paṇḍita** together are called **Bālapandīta**, and therefore, the death resulting from their combination is also called **Bālapandītamaraṇam**.

**So.**: Now, the **Aaturpratyakhyānāvacūra** (the essence of renouncing the desire to harm) is explained.

**De.**: It is said that the final stage of life is like the tip of a nine-pronged spear,

Chapter: 1 Verse: 2

1. Death of a child, 2. Death of one who has not constantly practiced right faith, 3. Death of a learned child who has left the country, 4. Death of a learned person who is a hypocrite, 5. Death of a learned person who is a Kevali.

The country is a part of the body of the universe. It is of two kinds, with and without offense, because of the nature of its origin from the mind. One who has renounced the country, even a small part of it, by killing or injuring it, dies, attains the fivefold state. He is a Shraddha-jiva. This is seen as the death of a learned child in the Shraddha-shastra, because there is no mention of a child in the other shastras. There, because there is no possibility of complete renunciation, a child is a learned person because of the renunciation of gross violence, etc., and a child is a learned child.

Five are the Anuvratas, seven are the Shiksha, and the Desayati Dharma. One who is endowed with all or any of these becomes a Desayati.

Five are the Anuvratas, which are small compared to the Mahavratas, and are the forms of renunciation of gross violence, etc. Seven are the Shiksha-vratas, which are primarily concerned with education. The seven Shiksha-vratas are mentioned because the Gunavratas are also considered to be Shiksha-vratas because they are constantly practiced. This Shravaka Dharma, which is composed of twelve Vratas, is the Desayati Dharma. One who is endowed with all or any of these twelve Vratas becomes a Desayati.

One who is endowed with all or any of these twelve Vratas becomes a Desayati.

One who is endowed with all or any of these twelve Vratas becomes a Desayati.

## Chapter 3: The Minor Vows (Anuvratas)

**The Minor Vows (Anuvratas) are:**

* **Refraining from killing living beings (Pranavada):** This refers to the destruction of life force (Pran), which is characterized by the senses, strength, breath, and lifespan. It does not mean killing a living being (Jiva), as it is impossible to kill a Jiva. As it is said:

> "The one who is constantly bound by the cycle of birth and death, and who is devoid of the means of liberation, is impermanent." (Samyak. Sapta. 61)

> "The destruction of the body, the suffering of the soul, and the entanglement of the mind, this is called killing, which should be avoided with all effort." (Shrav. Prajna. 191)

* **Refraining from lying (Musavada):** This refers to speaking falsely, which can be of two types based on the nature of the falsehood:

    * **Based on the nature of the object:** This includes four types:
        1. **Falsely claiming the existence of something that does not exist:** For example, claiming that the soul is omnipresent.
        2. **Falsely claiming the non-existence of something that exists:** For example, claiming that the soul does not exist.
        3. **Falsely attributing something to something else:** For example, saying "This cow is a horse."
        4. **Falsely accusing someone:** For example, saying "You are a leper."

    * **Based on the motivation behind the lie:** This includes anger, greed, fear, and delusion.

* **Refraining from accepting gifts that are not rightfully yours (Adatta-Paradara-Niyaman):** This refers to accepting gifts that belong to someone else, including:

    * **Gifts from a master:** This includes gifts from a king, a teacher, or a spiritual guide.
    * **Gifts from a Jiva:** This includes gifts from any living being.
    * **Gifts from a Tirthankara:** This includes gifts from a liberated soul.

    There are also three types of gifts based on the intention of the giver:

    * **Gifts given with a pure intention:** This includes gifts given with love, compassion, and respect.
    * **Gifts given with a mixed intention:** This includes gifts given with a mixture of good and bad intentions.
    * **Gifts given with a bad intention:** This includes gifts given with greed, anger, or hatred.

* **Refraining from sexual misconduct (Paradara-Niyaman):** This refers to engaging in sexual activity with someone who is not your spouse. It includes any act that violates the sanctity of marriage and the purity of relationships.

**The Minor Vows (Anuvratas) are a set of principles that help us to live a virtuous life. By practicing these vows, we can purify our mind, speech, and actions, and move towards liberation.**

**The meaning of the verse:**

> "Refraining from killing living beings, lying, accepting gifts that are not rightfully yours, and sexual misconduct, these are the Minor Vows (Anuvratas). Refraining from excessive desires is also a Minor Vow (Anuvrata)."

**The verse emphasizes the importance of controlling our desires and living a life of restraint and virtue.**

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam, Chapter 4

**Thus it is understood that it is done for a purpose.** The meaning is not the non-meaning, the non-meaning is purposeless. Living beings are punished and destroyed by these, so the abstinence from them is the second **guna-vrata**, and in the original order, the third. It is said:

> "**Avajjaanapamāyāyaria pavovāesahinsadāṇehiṁ |**
> **Cauhā aṇatthadando tabbiraī guṇavvayaṁ taiyaṁ ||1||**"

**Desavagasiyam piyam ti disamavakasha:** The daily limit of travel in a particular direction is **desavakashika**, and this too is a form of abstinence, which is the third **guna-vrata**. In the original order, it is the second **shiksha-vrata**. It is said:

> "**Jā (jo) jīvagahīya disiṁvayapamaṇam sankhevṇaṁ jamṇudiyahaṁ |**
> **Desavagasiyam taṁ bīyaṁ sikkhāvayam jāṇa ||1||**"

It is said: "Since this is known as a **shiksha-vrata**, how can it be called a **guna-vrata**?" Others say: "Those who have established limits in all **vayas** (stages of life), they still transgress them daily." Thus:

> "**Egamuhattaṁ divasaṁ rāī pañcāhameva pakkhaṁ vā |**
> **Vayamiha dhārei daḍhaṁ jāvaiyaṁ uvvahe kāle ||1||**"

[**Sambo. 1236**] According to the opinion of some, based on the above verse, "**Sarvavayaṇam karejj sankevami**" (one should limit all **vayas**). Based on this opinion, since **desavakashika** is a factor in all **vratas**, it is also a **guna-vrata**, and there is no fault in this. This is the meaning of the verse.

**Somam:** Now, the **shiksha-vratas** are generally mentioned, and those same **shiksha-vratas** are mentioned as **guna-vrata** in their specific form. 1. The abstinence from going beyond the limit set for travel in the directions, starting from the east, is the first **guna-vrata**.

> "**Jo dharai disivayamimaṁ so abhayaṁ dei savvajīvāṇaṁ |**
> **Bhuvaṇammi pasaramāṇaṁ lobhasamudam paḍikhalai ||**"

2. Thus, the meaning is: The purpose is not the non-meaning, the non-meaning is purposeless. Living beings are punished by these for the destruction of Dharma, so the abstinence from these punishments, which are actions of mind, speech, and body, is the second **guna-vrata**. 3. The daily limitation of travel in a particular direction, for those who have taken all **vratas** for life, or for those who have taken only the rule of travel in a particular direction, is **desavakashika**, and this is the third **guna-vrata**. Since this is known as a **shiksha-vrata**, it is still considered a **guna-vrata** here because it is a factor in all **vratas**, and there is no fault in this. 4. ... **Guna:** The abstinence from the directions, the abstinence

Chapter - 1 Verse - 5

Actions that are useless and harmful are punishable, and living beings are punished by them.  Therefore, refraining from such actions is the second of the five great vows, and the third in the original order.  The space for movement, which is the daily limit, is the space for movement in the country.  This is also a form of restraint, and it is the third of the five great vows, and the second in the original order.  It is said, "Since this is known as a vow of conduct, how can it be called a vow of virtue?"  Some say, "The measure that is established for all beings is also the measure that is to be observed daily."  This is the essence of the matter.  Therefore, since the space for movement in the country is conducive to all virtues, it is also a vow of virtue.  There is no fault in this. || 4 ||

The enumeration of enjoyments, the Samayika, the Atithi, and the division of the days are the four vows of conduct that have been spoken of. || 5 ||

The enumeration of enjoyments, the Samayika, the Atithi, and the division of the days are the four vows of conduct that have been spoken of. || 5 ||

Now, explaining the vows of conduct in detail, it is said:  Those that are enjoyed only once are called enjoyments, such as food and flowers.  Similarly, those that are enjoyed repeatedly are called repeated enjoyments, such as houses and wives.  It is said:

"That which is enjoyed only once is called enjoyment, such as food and saffron.  That which is enjoyed repeatedly is called repeated enjoyment, such as houses and wives." || 1 ||

The prefix "pari" means enumeration, and the enumeration of the measure of enjoyment is the meaning of the enumeration of the measure of enjoyment.  This is the first vow of conduct, and the second in the original order.  It is said:

"Just as there is a measure for the enjoyment of enjoyments, so also there is a measure for the enjoyment of repeated enjoyments.  The name of enjoyment and repeated enjoyment is the vow of virtue, which is the seed." || 1 ||

Similarly, "Samayika" means the sum of all income and profit, which is the Samaya.  The Samayika is the same as the Samaya, and the suffix "ika" is dropped due to its being a common noun.  This is the second vow of conduct, and the first in the original order.  It is said:

"The state of mind that is free from attachment, that is collected, that is joyful, and that is equal to all beings, is called the Samayika for the householder, and it is the first vow of conduct." || 1 ||

"Atithi" means that there are no days, festivals, or celebrations.  It is said:

"He who is free from attachment to days, festivals, and celebrations, and who is free from attachment to the observance of vows, is called the Atithi, and he is the one who has attained purity." || 1 ||

## The Chapter on the Rejection of Eagerness (Aatupraatyaakhyaana Prakirnakam) Chapter 5

**Division, Distribution.** The distribution of a guest is called guest distribution (Atithi Sambhaag). 'Cha' indicates a collection. This third training vow (Shikshaavratam) is in the order of the text, but in the original order it is the fourth. It is said:

> "Whatever gift is very small, like food, clothing, and bedding,
> That is the fourth training vow, guest distribution, know it." (1)

**Nourishment (Posah)** - That which gives nourishment and strength to Dharma is called nourishment (Posah). It is said:

> "He who nourishes good Dharma, protects life, and avoids evil conduct,
> That is called nourishment, it is the destruction of suffering for the householder." (1)

The method of nourishment is called the method of nourishment (Posahvidhi). 'Cha' indicates a collection. The method of nourishment is the fourth, and it is characterized by all food, care of the body, celibacy, and activity. Here, in the order of the text, it is the fourth training vow, but in the original order it is the third. These four training vows have been stated.

**But how can the vow of non-possession (Ugopabhoga Vratam) be called a training vow, since it is known to be virtuous by being accepted for life?** Because it is repeatedly summarized every day, every night, every hour, every moment, and because it is repeatedly practiced by the teacher, it is also a training vow. (5)

**Soma:** Now, the training vows are stated:

1. **Enjoyment (Bhoga)** - Things like food and flowers are enjoyed once, and by implication, things like wives are enjoyed repeatedly. The counting and measuring of these is the first training vow. Even though this is known to be a virtuous vow by being accepted for life, it is also a training vow because it is repeatedly summarized every day, every night, every hour, etc., and because it is repeatedly practiced by the teacher. Therefore, there is no fault here.

2. **Equanimity (Samaaya)** - The income and profit of one who is free from attachment and aversion is called equanimity (Samaaya). Equanimity itself is the second training vow. The omission of the case ending is due to the Prakrit language.

3. **Guest Distribution (Atithi Sambhaag)** - The distribution of a guest, who is always devoted to Dharma because he has no days or festivals, is the third training vow.

4. **Nourishment (Posah)** - That which gives nourishment and strength to Dharma is called nourishment (Posah). The method of nourishment is called the method of nourishment (Posahvidhi). 'Cha' indicates a collection. The method of nourishment is the fourth, and it is characterized by all food, care of the body, celibacy, and activity. These four are the training vows. (5)

**Guna:** Things like food and flowers are enjoyed once, and by implication, things like wives are enjoyed repeatedly. The counting and measuring of these is the first training vow, in the original order.

Chapter: 1 Verse: 6

The second is the **guna-vrata**.  Samaya is the second **shiksha-vrata** in the order of the **samaya**, but the first in the original order.  **Atithi-sanvibhaga** is the division of the guest.  **Cha** is used for collection.  **Poushadha** is that which nourishes and strengthens the Dharma.  It is said:

> That which nourishes good Dharma, protects life, and removes the accumulated karma,
> That is called **Poushadha**, and it is the destruction of suffering for the householder. ||1||

The method of this is the **Poushadha-vidhi**.  Here, in this order, the fourth **shiksha-vrata** is the third in the original order.  These four **shiksha-vratas** have been mentioned. ||5||

> In the face of imminent death, with life's hope unbroken,
> Not freed by relatives, without performing the final **sanlekhana**,
> That is called **balapandita-marana**. ||6||

**Bhuva:**  Now, when does a **shravaka** die a **balapandita-marana**?  It is said:  **Ashu** means quick, **kara** means action, **ashukara** is the time of death due to urgency, **marana** means death, **achintit** means unexpected, **upasthita** means present, **upkramana** means approach.

> Like a rope tied for a long time, suddenly breaking,
> With the mind absorbed in the enjoyment of the fruits of karma,
> That is called **balapandita-marana**. ||1||

With these examples, when death is imminent, one should perform **balapandita-marana**.  **Achinna** means unbroken, **jiviyasa** means hope of life.  Or, death has come gradually, but **sanlekhana** has not been performed.  Why?  It is said:  **Achinna** means unbroken, **trutita** means broken, **jiviyasa** means hope of life, because of this unbroken hope of life, **sanlekhana** and **sanstara-diksha** have not been performed.  **Na-ahim** means not, **amukko** means freed, **jnatai** means by relatives, **mutkalita** means freed.  **Pachchima-sanlekhana** means the final **sanlekhana**, **akiccha** means not done.  Therefore, without performing the final **sanlekhana** which is the duty at the end of life, and without performing the **tapas** which is the drying up of the body, the death that one dies is called **balapandita-marana**.  This is the meaning of the verse. ||6||

**Soma:**  Now, when does a **shravaka** die a **balapandita-marana**?  It is said:  **Ashu** means quick, **kara** means action, **ashukara** means urgency, **marana** means death, **autsukya** means urgency, **marana-avasara** means the time of death, **achintit** means unexpected, **upasthita** means present.  Thus, when death is imminent, one should perform **balapandita-marana**.  Or, **achinna** means unbroken, **trutita** means broken, **achinna** means unbroken, what is **achinna**?  It is the hope of life.

## Chapter 12: The Scattering of the Rejection of Anxiety, Verse 7: Death of a Child-Sage

**6.** The death of a child-sage is described in the previous verse. It is when someone dies without having performed the duties of the latter part of life, such as *sanlekhanā* (voluntary fasting unto death) and austerities, even though they are aware of them and have not been prevented by their family.

**Explanation:**  *Āśu* means quick or swift. The time of death arrived suddenly or gradually, but they did not perform *sanlekhanā*. Why? Because their hope for life was not severed or broken. They were not freed or released by their family and relatives. Therefore, they died without performing *sanlekhanā* and austerities, which are the duties of the latter part of life. This is called the death of a child-sage, as explained in the previous verse.

**7.**  *Ālociya* means after having consulted. *Nissallo* means free from *śalya* (afflictions). *Āruhittu* means having ascended. *Santhāram* means the *sanstāraka* (bed of grass). *Deśavirao* means one who has renounced the world. If someone dies after renouncing the world, it is called the death of a child-sage.

**Explanation:**  The text explains how someone can die at home. *Ālociya* means that they have consulted with their spiritual teacher and accepted the atonement given by them. *Nissallo* means that they are free from *śalya*. *Śalya* is of two types: material and mental. Material *śalya* includes thorns, dust, etc., while mental *śalya* includes contradictions in the principles, virtues, and higher virtues. By consulting with their teacher, they have removed all *śalya*. The text quotes a verse:

> "A person with *śalya* cannot be considered pure, as stated in the scriptures. Only by removing all *śalya* can one attain liberation."

The text then explains that the person has ascended their own home and accepted the *sanstāraka*. *Sanstāraka* refers to the bed of grass used during *anashana* (voluntary fasting). The *anashana* performed with the *sanstāraka* is also called *sanstāraka*. The person who has performed *anashana* with the *sanstāraka* is in a state of meditation. *Deśavirao* means one who has renounced the world. If someone dies after renouncing the world, it is called the death of a child-sage.

**Commentary:**  The text explains that the person who dies at home has consulted with their spiritual teacher, accepted the atonement, and is free from all afflictions. They have also performed *anashana* with the *sanstāraka* and are in a state of meditation. This is why their death is considered the death of a child-sage.

Chapter: 1 Verse: 8
13
One who is freed from the *sanstāraka* by proper treatment. If he dies while abstaining from food, being detached from the world and in a state of meditation, it is called the death of a *Bālapaṇḍita*. ||7||
Commentary: He asks how such a person dies at home. He says that after consulting with the guru and accepting the prescribed atonement, there are two types of *śalya* (afflictions) - *dravyaśalya* (material affliction) like thorns, etc., and *bhāvaśalya* (mental affliction) like the opposition of the roots, qualities, etc. By consulting with the guru, one is free from *śalya*. Having done this, one should ascend to one's own abode and accept the *sanstāraka* in the form of a *darbha* (grass) mat at the time of abstaining from food. Because whatever is done according to the *sanstāraka* method, even the act of abstaining from food is called *sanstāraka*. If one dies while detached from the world, it is called the death of a *Bālapaṇḍita*. ||7||
The *uprakrama* (preliminary practice) for "the acquisition of *bhakti* (devotion)" is described in detail. This is the same *uprakrama* that is to be known in the death of a *Bālapaṇḍita* as appropriate. ||8||
Commentary: He then asks how this should be done. He says that the *uprakrama* (preliminary practice) for a *śrāvaka* (lay follower) who is abstaining from food in the study of *bhaktiparijñā* (knowledge of devotion) is the *pīṭhabandha* (binding of the seat) described in detail in the verses beginning with "I am detached from the world", etc. The verses beginning with "It should be observed", etc., and "It should be regulated", etc., describe the method. The *guru* worship, the *saṅgha* worship, the giving of gifts out of compassion for fellow religionists, the giving of gifts from one's own wealth, the construction of *caitya* (shrine) and *ārāpaṇa* (offering) for the previous *jinas*, the installation of these, the writing of books on the principles, the honoring of the four types of *saṅgha* (community) as appropriate, the *pravājana* (leading out) of the *saṅgha*, the *kārapaṇa* (offering), the pilgrimage to holy places, the teaching of the *jina* teachings, the propagation of the *jina* teachings, the offering of abundant wealth, the making of *stava* (hymns), the freeing of one's own people, the worship of the *caitya*, the informing of the *guru*, the offering of twelve *avartas* (cycles of worship), the acceptance of gifts, the *ālocanā* (reflection), the acceptance of *samyaktvā* (right faith), the *āṇuvrata* (minor vows), the *uccāṇa* (elevation), the *purussara* (leading the way) - all these are described in detail in the *vidhi* (method). This is the same *uprakrama* that is to be described in the death of a *Bālapaṇḍita* in this study, as appropriate and as necessary. This is the literal meaning. And this is shown here as follows:
He who is not lazy, who is generous, who is a *harisavasaṭṭakaṇṭayakarāla

##  Chapter 14:  The Discourse on Rejecting the Sick

**14.** This is what should be done:  One should give charity, both in the form of food and money.  One should first bow down to the Guru and then contemplate all this. || 4 ||

**5.**  In the last time cycle, the Jinas have given the teachings, and the teachings are to be contemplated.  The rules that are well-spoken should be followed. || 5 ||

**6.**  When contemplating the teachings, one should be free from attachment, and one should be free from the desire for worldly things.  One should contemplate the teachings with the same mind as the Siddhas. || 6 ||

**7.**  One should not give food to the sick, nor should one give them anything else.  For a long time, they will be a burden and will have to be listened to. || 7 ||

**8.**  One should not be attached to the sick, as the teachings say that they are a burden.  One who is free from attachment to all beings will attain liberation. || 8 ||

**9.**  Death is the death of the sick, it is the great ocean of suffering.  The souls wander in the cycle of birth and death, bound by karma. || 9 ||

**10.**  One who is free from attachment to all beings, who is wealthy and has a good family, who is endowed with the seven virtues, and who is a follower of the Jinas, will be liberated. || 10 ||

**11.**  I bow down to the Gurus, who have taught the difficult rules of conduct, which are related to right faith, right knowledge, right conduct, right effort, and right mindfulness. || 11 ||

**12.**  One who is free from attachment to all beings, who has climbed the mountain of liberation, who is free from fear, who knows the truth, will be liberated. || 12 ||

**13.**  I seek refuge in the Jinas, the Siddhas, the good, and the Dharma.  I bow down to the Jinas, and I seek refuge in them.  I will practice austerities. || 13 ||

**14.**  I bow down to the Arhats, the conquerors, who are free from the stains of karma.  I bow down to all the Siddhas. || 14 ||

**15.**  I bow down to all the Ayariyas, who are the holders of the five virtues.  I bow down to the Siddhas, the teachers, and the monks. || 15 ||

**16.**  I bow down to the good, who are endowed with the virtue of patience, who are the mountains of all virtues, and who are the helpers of the Dharma. || 16 ||

Chapter: 1 Verse: 8

Do not be disheartened, O brave ones, for what is there to fear?  Even if you are faced with adversity, do not be discouraged. ||69||

Free from the cycle of birth and death, transcending the world and the afterlife, living in the bliss of liberation, free from attachment and delusion, this is the true path. ||70||

The twelvefold path of liberation, the fivefold vows, the twenty-fivefold virtues, these are the paths to liberation. ||71||

Do not be deceived by the illusions of the world, the fleeting pleasures and pains, the coming together and separation, the impermanence of life and death. Be steadfast in your resolve, O brave ones. ||72||

Just as a bird seeks refuge in a strong tree, so too should one seek refuge in the teachings of the Jinas, the conquerors of delusion. ||73||

Do not be like a foolish person who wastes their precious time in worldly pursuits. Instead, strive for the eternal bliss of liberation, the true wealth that is beyond the reach of the senses. ||74||

The true path lies in the practice of the twelvefold path, the fivefold vows, the twenty-fivefold virtues, the practice of meditation and contemplation, and the offering of salutations to the Jinas. ||75||

At the time of death, one should remember the twelvefold path, the fivefold vows, the twenty-fivefold virtues, and the fourfold refuge. ||76||

This is the supreme path, the path that leads to liberation, the path that extinguishes suffering and brings true happiness. ||77||

Thus, by practicing the fivefold vows, with a pure and joyful heart, one sheds the shackles of delusion and attains liberation. ||78||

**Commentary:**

The author explains that the process of a Shravaka (lay follower) taking the vow of non-eating (Anashan) should be explained in detail, as it is a significant event. The process involves various steps, including:

* **Guru Sangha Puja:** Offering respect to the community of teachers.
* **Sadharmika Swatjan Vatsalya:** Showing love and compassion to fellow practitioners.
* **Dinadi Dan:** Giving charity to the needy.
* **Jina Chaitya Kara Apan Bimba Nirman:** Creating images and symbols of the Jinas.
* **Tat Pratistapana:** Establishing these images and symbols.
* **Siddhant Lekhan:** Writing about the teachings of the Jinas.
* **Tirth Yatra Vidhan:** Organizing pilgrimages to sacred sites.
* **Jina Shasan Prabhavna:** Spreading the teachings of the Jinas.

The author emphasizes that these acts of merit should be performed before taking the vow of non-eating. He also mentions that the process of a young scholar (Bal Pandit) taking the vow of non-eating should be explained in a similar manner.

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam, Chapter 9

**Verse 8**

The method by which this (merit) is achieved is explained as follows: The initiation (upkrama), the establishment of the seat (piṭhabandha), which is described in detail in the chapter on the knowledge of the devotees (bhaktaparijñādhyayana), is the same here as well. In this study, the death of a child prodigy (bālapanditamaraṇa) should be understood in a suitable and appropriate manner.

**Verse 9**

**Vēmaṇi**

The (śrāvaka) attains the (heavenly) abode of the **Vēmaṇi** (Vāimānika) according to the rule (niyama). He attains the seventh (heaven) due to his excellent (ukkośa) merit.

**Vimāne Bhava**

**Bhūva**

Now, to show where this (śrāvaka) who has performed such meritorious deeds will attain, it is said: "Vāimānika, they are also Jyotiṣka." To differentiate this, it is further explained: "Kappouvagēsu" - those who attain the **Kalpa** (heavenly abodes) like Saudharma, etc., but not those who are beyond the **Kalpa**. "Niyamenā tasya uvavāo" - the (śrāvaka) attains the Saudharma, etc., according to the rule (niyama), due to his certainty (niścaya). Because he has no bondage (bandhābhāva) due to his unfixed lifespan (abaddhāyuṣa) and the lifespan of the Vāimānika (Vāimānikavarjadevāyuṣa). And thus, accepting the attainment of the Arṣa (heaven), it is said: "Sāvagassa jahannēnaṁ sohammē uvavāo, ukkosēnaṁ accuē" (The śrāvaka attains the Saudharma due to his merit, and he ascends due to his excellent merit). Now, to explain in which (heaven) he will be, it is said: "Niyamā sijjhai ukkosēnaṁ" - he will attain the seventh (heaven) due to his certainty (niścaya) and excellent merit (ukkośa).

**Soma**

Now, to show where this (śrāvaka) who has performed such meritorious deeds will attain, it is said: "Vimāne Bhava" - Vāimānika, they are also Jyotiṣka. To differentiate this, it is further explained: "Kappouvagēsu" - those who attain the **Kalpa** (heavenly abodes) like Saudharma, etc., but not those who are beyond the **Kalpa**. The (śrāvaka) who previously had an unfixed lifespan (abaddhāyuṣa) attains the Saudharma, etc., due to his certainty (niyama) and ascends from the lowest (Saudharma) to the highest (Acyuta) as far as his ability to go. Now, to explain how many heavens this (śrāvaka) who has performed meritorious deeds (śrāddha dharma āradhaka) and has not fallen from the path (apratipatita dharma) will attain, it is said: "Niyamā" - he will attain the seventh (heaven) due to his certainty (niścaya) and excellent merit (ukkośa), and also from the lowest (Caturtha) to the highest.

**Verse 9 (Summary)**

Vāimānika are also Jyotiṣka. The (

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam, Chapter 11

**Regarding the consequences of wrong belief, whether in this world, the next world, or in beings with or without consciousness, or in the five sense objects, I wish to perform atonement.**

**[The student says to the Guru:]** "Reverend Sir, I wish to perform atonement. I desire and accept it."

**[The Guru asks:]** "What do you wish to atone for?"

**[The student replies:]** "I wish to atone for the highest good, the non-acceptance of food."

**[The Guru says:]** "What do you do to achieve this?"

**[The student replies:]** "Generally, I abstain from all evil, from all wrong paths. I atone for the following fifteen reasons:

* **Previous food:** I atone for eating food that was not properly obtained, not properly cooked, not properly offered, not properly received, or received with greed, attachment, anger, delusion, foolishness, dullness, pride, arrogance, or with the use of the four senses, the five senses, or with the burden of a wife and children, or with the desire for worldly pleasures.
* **Present food:** I atone for the present food that I am about to eat.
* **Future food:** I atone for the future food that I will eat.

**[The Guru says:]** "You have spoken generally about atonement. Now, speak specifically about the three times."

**[The student replies:]** "I atone for the past evil actions, such as slander, abuse, and violence, by performing atonement. I atone for the future evil actions, such as avoiding, preventing, and controlling, by performing atonement. I atone for the present evil actions, such as the present karma that binds me, by performing atonement through the method of repentance.

**[The Guru says:]** "What kind of atonement do you perform?"

**[The student replies:]** "I atone for the evil actions that I have committed myself. I atone for the evil actions that I have caused others to commit. I atone for the evil actions that I have approved of, such as the killing of enemies, by performing atonement.

**[The Guru says:]** "The soul binds itself to evil actions through the four causes: thought, speech, body, and the three times (past, present, future). Therefore, the soul must atone for these actions.

**[The student replies:]** "I atone for the wrong belief, which includes the five types of wrong belief: attachment, aversion, delusion, doubt, and wrong perception. I atone for the lack of restraint, which includes the evil actions of thought, speech, and body. I atone for the passions, which include the four types of passions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed. I atone for the evil actions, which include the three types of evil actions: thought, speech, and body.

**[The Guru says:]** "Therefore, you must perform atonement for the wrong belief, the lack of restraint, the passions, and the evil actions.

**[The student replies:]** "I will perform atonement for the wrong belief, the lack of restraint, the passions, and the evil actions. I will also perform atonement for the lack of concentration and the lack of proper conduct.

**[The Guru says:]** "This is the fourfold atonement."

**[The student replies:]** "I understand."

**[The Guru says:]** "Now, regarding the consequences of wrong belief, whether in this world, the next world, or in beings with or without consciousness, or in the five sense objects, I wish to perform atonement."

Chapter 1, Verse 11

"I confess the misdeeds of whoever, being a day or night transgressor, transgressor, violator, or non-observant, has committed a false misdeed due to the consequence of false belief."

Here, in the human world, or in the human world among the human beings, whatever offense has been committed, that is a false misdeed. The word "or" indicates the inclusion of all the terms. In the other worlds, or in the other worlds, other than the human race, such as the animal world, whatever offense has been committed, that is a false misdeed. In the sentient beings, or in the sentient beings, such as the earth and others, whatever has been done by collision, etc., that is a false misdeed. In the non-sentient beings, or in the non-sentient beings, such as dry grass, straw, and difficult-to-recognize blankets, etc., whatever has been done by sleeping, sitting, etc., that is a false misdeed. In gold, etc., or in things seen on the path, whatever has been done by me-ness, etc., that is a false misdeed. In the five sense objects, or in the five sense objects, such as sound, form, taste, smell, and touch, whatever has been done by attraction, aversion, etc., that is a false misdeed.

Similarly, in the false belief, etc., such as "eating food", etc., and in the ignorance, etc., such as "meditation", etc., whatever transgression, etc., of knowledge, etc., has occurred, I repent for that.

Thus, the penitent, after being informed by the guru, says as follows: "I desire, I wish, I accept." The meaning is "I wish to do the best thing, to abstain from food." Then, wishing to do that, he says what he will do first: "I repent, I refrain from general sins." The meaning is "I refrain from the wrong path, which has been understood by the fifteen reasons, such as "eating food", "drinking", "killing", etc." Then, he speaks of the repentance specific to the three times: "I repent for the past, the past evil actions, such as "slander, greed, and hatred", etc. I repent for the future, the future sinful beginnings, such as "avoidance, prevention, and restraint", etc. I repent for the present, by the method of preventing the sinful beginnings that are present, I refrain, by the means of repentance, etc." Then, he says what kind of repentance he is doing: "I repent for the sin that has been done, that has been produced, by myself, and that has been caused by others, and that has been approved of, such as "the act of killing an enemy, which is worthy of being done", etc." This sin binds the living being only by the four causes of false belief, non-restraint, passions, and karma. Therefore, he repents for that. I repent for the false belief, which is of five kinds, such as attachment, etc., and for the non-restraint, which is of one kind, and for the passions, which are of four kinds, such as anger, etc., and for the sinful actions, which are of three kinds, mental, verbal, and bodily actions.

Therefore, after this, in the phrases "in the consequences of false belief, etc.", etc., up to "of the one who has understood", etc., the following should be added: "Whoever, being a day or night transgressor, transgressor, violator, or non-observant, has committed a false misdeed, I confess his misdeeds." Therefore, the meaning is: "In the consequence of false belief, in the determination of false

##  Atikramanaprakirnakam Dudhyan-1

This is a treatise on the rejection of transgressions.

**The nature of transgressions, etc.**

The nature of transgressions, etc., as described in the scriptures, such as "Kammamantana," should be understood as applicable to all sins. In this world, i.e., in the human world, any transgression, such as violence, committed with the intention of harming, is considered a false transgression. The word "va" (or) is used here to indicate a collective sense. In the other worlds, i.e., in the worlds other than the human world, such as the animal world, any transgression committed is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any collision, etc., committed in the world of sentient beings, such as the earth, etc., is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any act of lying down, sitting, etc., committed on inanimate objects, such as dry grass, etc., is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any act of taking, etc., committed with the intention of taking, etc., in the case of gold, etc., or in the case of things found on the road, etc., is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any act of attachment, detachment, etc., committed in the case of the five sense objects, i.e., sound, form, smell, taste, and touch, which are pleasing or displeasing to the mind, is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any act of transgression, etc., committed in the case of food, etc., or in the case of the aforementioned false views, etc., or in the case of the future ignorance, etc., or in the case of meditation, etc., is considered a false transgression. I reject all these transgressions, etc., with the understanding that they are my own.

**The request for forgiveness**

The essence of what is to be said here is expressed by the teacher through the request for forgiveness: "I desire, I wish." He requests the teacher, "Bhadant," to forgive him. "I wish to practice the right conduct of non-violence." "I repent for all my general transgressions. I turn away from all wrong paths and embrace the right path." Although repentance is generally mentioned, the specific time-related aspects are also mentioned: "Aiyam" refers to past transgressions, "Anagatam" refers to future transgressions, "Pratyutpatram" refers to the present moment, "Kritam" refers to the transgressions committed by oneself, "Karitam" refers to the transgressions committed by others on one's behalf, and "Anumoditam" refers to the transgressions that one has approved of, such as the killing of enemies.

**The five types of false views**

The five types of false views are: "Mithyatva," "Abhigrahika," etc. The one type of unrestraint is "Asamyam." The four types of passions are "Kasaya." The three types of transgression are "Papaprayoga," "Manovakkayayoga," "Aprashasthayoga." The consequences of wrong views are "Micchadasana," "Parinama," etc. All these terms should be understood in the context of "Padibuddhas" (those who have understood).

**The false transgression of ignorance**

When there is the consequence of false views, any transgression, etc., committed by me, whether it is during the day or night, is considered a false transgression. In this world, i.e., in the human world, any transgression committed is considered a false transgression. In the other worlds, i.e., in the worlds other than the human world, such as the animal world, any transgression committed is considered a false transgression. Similarly, any collision, etc., committed in the

**Som.**  Annanam jhanē -  Not knowledge, not ignorance, that which is meditation, ignorance itself is the best, because of the absence of explanation, creation, etc.  Just as the thought in one's own mind of a person who has not been able to shake off the past life, like a student who has been disturbed by the teacher's reading.  In that ignorance meditation, whatever transgression arises, that is false, evil.  Anusvara is everywhere because of the Prakrit nature. ||1||

**8 - Ragamjhaane | Ragadhyane |**

**Bhuva:**  Raga is attachment, delight, or pleasure. It is the nature of unmanifested Maya and greed, and is merely an attachment.  Dhyana (meditation) is on this. It is of three types: Kama Raga, Sneha Raga, and Drishti Raga. 

Kama Raga is like Vishnu's attachment to Sri, or Vikrama's attachment to Yasho Raja. 

Sneha Raga is like the attachment of Dama, Nak, and the best of the Asuras, who experience a breaking of their heart upon hearing of the death of their own son. 

Drishti Raga is like Kapila, who came from the Brahma Loka and, being attached to his own vision, said to his disciple, "You are dwelling in Asura." || 8 ||

**Commentary by Soma:** Niyanam Jhanē - The cause is the desire for heavenly rewards and other powers. It is the form of nine new causes in the future. It is like the desire of Draupadi, who was born from the union of Nandishena and Gangadatta. ||23||

**Commentary:** Yuddha (war) is the mutual attempt to kill each other. It is like the war between the Kauravas and Pandavas, or like the war between the king of Kuni and his enemy, or like the war between the king of Angaravati and his enemy.

**29. Nijujhanjhaane (Niyuddhadhyane)**

**Commentary:** Niyuddha (final war) is the war that ends in death. It is like the war between the Pandavas and Kauravas, or like the war between the king of Matsya and the king of Attana.

**30. Sangamjhaane (Sangadhyane)**

**Commentary:** Sang (attachment) is the desire to reunite with someone even after they have been abandoned. It is like the attachment of Rathnemi to Rajimati, or like the attachment of Bhavadeva to Nagila.

## Chapter 1: Distractions 61, 62

**61 - Saataagaurava Dhyana (Pride of Happiness)**

**Commentary:** Saata (happiness) is a pleasant feeling, and the pride associated with it is called Saataagaurava. This is the focus of this meditation.  It is like the pride of the moon, as described in the verse "Nara Yattho Sasiraaya" (He who is the moon, is the king of the night).

**62 - Avirmana Dhyana (Unceasing Meditation)**

**Commentary:** Avirmana means not stopping, not ceasing. This meditation focuses on the constant effort to remain in a state of non-attachment, even when faced with temptations. It is like the story of a father who, despite knowing his sons are prone to bad behavior, continues to guide them.  Similarly, it is like the story of the mute animal who, despite being repeatedly warned by the gods, continues to fall into the same traps.  This meditation reminds us that even when we are aware of our weaknesses, we must continue to strive for liberation.

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam Durdhyan-63 Ga. 11

63-Amutimaranamjhaane [Amuctimaranadhyane]
Bhuvo- Liberation is liberation from the cycle of birth and death, a state of auspiciousness, not liberation from liberation. Death in that state is Amuctimaran, and meditation on that is Amuctimaranadhyan. As such, do not create the cause for this obstacle to liberation. Just as in the world, the statement of Vansharjuna, even though repeatedly dissuaded by the painting, still creates the cause for his downfall by having an inauspicious attitude, thinking, "Even after experiencing this glory, I will not desire liberation," etc.
Vanshalakshmiamanuddhrutiya samucchedena vidvisham.
Nirvanamapimanayehamaantaraayam jayasriyah. || iti [Kirata-11-69] || 63 ||
In some readings, the word "ruvanjhaane" is also seen. There, "rupa" means "to be seen," "to be observed," etc. in mirrors, etc. That meditation is on that, and it is of two types: meditation on one's own form and meditation on another's form. There, as in the case of Sanatkumara, who was praised by the gods for his beautiful form, it is meditation on one's own form. Meditation on another's form, however, is like that of the Gopadarakas, whose minds are distracted by the excessive beauty of the Abhira girl, and whose chariots are broken by their chariots being overturned due to going off the path near the chariot. Or, as in the case of Chandrapradhyota, who meditates on the forms of Angaravati, etc., which are painted on the canvas, it is meditation on another's form. These six types of meditation are all of a violent nature, and are therefore the objects of false misconduct.
Soma- Amutimaranam jhaane - Liberation is liberation from the cycle of birth and death, not liberation from liberation. It means the desire for worldly pleasures. Therefore, death in that state is meditation on that. "Do not create the cause for this obstacle to liberation," etc. Even though repeatedly dissuaded by his brother, the virtuous one, he creates the cause for his downfall by having an inauspicious attitude, thinking, "Even after experiencing this glory of the wheel, I will not desire liberation," etc. || 63 ||
These sixty types of meditation are all of a violent nature, and are therefore the objects of false misconduct. The anusvara in all the meditation words is to be understood as a lakshanika, and its elision is to be done.
Guna- Liberation is liberation from the cycle of birth and death, a state of auspiciousness. Not liberation from liberation. Death in that state is Amuctimaran, and meditation on that is Amuctimaranadhyan. As such, do not create the cause for this obstacle to liberation. Even though repeatedly dissuaded, he creates the cause for his downfall by having an inauspicious attitude, thinking, "Even after experiencing this glory, I will not desire liberation," etc. || 63 ||
Pasuttasssa va padibuddhassa va jo me koi devasio raio uttamaddhe aikkamo vaikkamo aiyaro anayaro tassa miccha me dukkadam. || 11 ||
Prasuptasyava pratibuddhasyava yo maya kashchidaivasiko raatriko uttamarthe'tikramo vyatikramo'ticaro'nacharo tasya mithya me dusskritam. || 11 ||

Chapter 1, Verse 12

**Bhūva:** Now, in what state are these (acts of) mindfulness born? It is said: "Of the **prasupta** (one who is asleep), or the **paḍibuddha** (one who is awake), or of one who is born in the day, or one who is born in the night. **Uttamaṭṭe** (for the highest purpose), **aikkama** (transgression) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **vaikkamo** (special transgression) in the form of a difference in words for the purpose of accepting, **aiyāro** (exceeding) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **aṇāyāro** (non-conduct) in the form of abstaining from and upholding conduct, meaning non-conduct is the consumption of that. "Born" is a word that encompasses all of this. "I wish that all of my non-conduct may become **mithyā duṣkṛta** (false evil)." Whatever evil I have done, may it become false. This method of **mithyā duṣkṛta** is common in the death of a child, the death of a learned person, and the death of a learned person who is also a learned person.

**Soma:** Now, in what state are these (acts of) mindfulness born? It is said: "Of the **prasupta** (one who is asleep), or the **paḍibuddha** (one who is awake), or of one who is born in the day, or one who is born in the night. **Uttamaṭṭe** (for the highest purpose), **aikkama** (transgression) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **vaikkamo** (special transgression) in the form of a difference in words for the purpose of accepting, **aiyāro** (exceeding) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **aṇāyāro** (non-conduct) in the form of abstaining from and upholding conduct, meaning non-conduct is the consumption of that.

**Guṇa:** Now, in what state are these (acts of) mindfulness born? It is said: "Of the **prasupta** (one who is asleep), or the **paḍibuddha** (one who is awake), or of one who is born in the day, or one who is born in the night. **Uttamaṭṭe** (for the highest purpose), **aikkama** (transgression) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **vaikkamo** (special transgression) in the form of a difference in words for the purpose of accepting, **aiyāro** (exceeding) in the form of accepting an invitation, etc., **aṇāyāro** (non-conduct) in the form of abstaining from and upholding conduct, meaning non-conduct is the consumption of that. "Born" is a word that encompasses all of this. "I wish that all of my non-conduct may become **mithyā duṣkṛta** (false evil)."

I offer my salutations to the **Jina** **Vardhamāna** (the victorious one who is growing), and to all the other **Jinas** and their **gana** (followers).

**Chapter 13: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager**

This chapter discusses the concrete rejection of the eager, which is related to life. It says: "I, in the presence of the entire assembly, make a prostration and bow down." To whom? To the present Tirthankara, the Lord Jinavarasabha, the supreme among the Kevalis, the one known as Vardhamana, the god. Not only to him, but also to the rest of the Tirthankaras, starting with Rishabha, and to all the past, present, and future Tirthankaras, including those who are accompanied by their Ganadharas. 

**Verse 12:**

"I, in the presence of the entire assembly, make a prostration and bow down." To whom? To the present Tirthankara, the Lord Jinavarasabha, the supreme among the Kevalis, the one known as Vardhamana, the god. Not only to him, but also to the rest of the Tirthankaras, starting with Rishabha, and to all the past, present, and future Tirthankaras, including those who are accompanied by their Ganadharas. 

**Commentary:**

If a devotee, while engaged in virtuous conduct, encounters a calamity caused by gods or others, such as a river or a disease, and is in a situation where his life is at stake, he should perform this concrete rejection in the following manner: "I, in the presence of the entire assembly, make a prostration and bow down." To whom? To the present Tirthankara, the Lord Jinavarasabha, the supreme among the Kevalis, the one known as Vardhamana, the god. Not only to him, but also to the rest of the Tirthankaras, starting with Rishabha, and to all the past, present, and future Tirthankaras, including those who are accompanied by their Ganadharas. 

**Verse 13:**

"I reject all beginnings of life, all false speech, all taking of what is not given, all sexual intercourse, and all possessions."

**Commentary:**

The Tirthankara, having performed the prostration to the Ganadharas, then utters the vows, saying: "I reject all beginnings of life, all false speech, all taking of what is not given, all sexual intercourse, and all possessions." This means that he recites the vow-mantra, starting with "First, O Lord, I take refuge in the vow of non-violence, I reject all violence, etc." He also rejects false speech, meaning he rejects lying. He rejects all taking of what is not given, meaning he rejects the third vow. He rejects all sexual intercourse, which is of eighteen types, including the thought, speech, and body actions related to it, as well as the acceptance of gifts, the use of force, and the enjoyment of the body. He rejects all possessions, which are of twenty-four types. The word "also" indicates that he rejects other things as well.

I renounce the three types of pride and the sixteen types of passions. The word "cha" means "all." I renounce all sense of "mine," all restrictions, and all unconsciousness.

Chapter: - 1 Verse: 17, 18
Salutations to the Siddhas, the Arhats, who are free from all suffering.
I believe in the teachings of the Jinas and reject all evil. || 17 ||
The commentator Bhuvanendra asks: What is meant by the rejection of evil deeds? And what is meant by belief? || 17 ||
The commentator Somendra answers: The rejection of evil deeds is explained as follows: Those who are free from all suffering, to them be salutations. The word "Siddhas" is used in the plural, but it also includes the Tirthankaras. Therefore, salutations to the Siddhas and the Arhats. The word "Jina" refers to the Tirthankaras, and the word "prajnapta" refers to their teachings. Therefore, the meaning is: I believe in all the teachings of the Jinas. The word "papaka" refers to evil deeds, and the word "pratyakhyami" means "I reject." Therefore, the meaning is: I reject all evil deeds. || 17 ||
The commentator Gunendra says: Salutations to the Siddhas, who are free from all suffering. Salutations to the Arhats. The meaning is: I believe in all the teachings of the Jinas. The meaning is: I reject all evil deeds. This is called the rejection of evil deeds. || 17 ||
Salutations to the Siddhas, the great sages, who have destroyed their karmas.
I accept the teachings of the Kevalis, as they have been revealed. || 18 ||
The commentator Bhuvanendra says: Salutations to the Siddhas, who have destroyed their eight types of karmas. The word "cha" indicates that the salutations also include the Tirthankaras and the great sages, such as the Ganadharas. The word "santharaka" refers to the practice of fasting, which is prescribed by the Kevalis. The meaning is: I accept the practice of fasting, as it has been revealed by the Kevalis. || 18 ||
The commentator Somendra says: The rejection of evil deeds has been explained. Now, the wise person, who is free from worldly attachments and desires, rejects evil deeds and accepts the teachings of the Jinas. The meaning is: Salutations to the Siddhas, who have destroyed their eight types of karmas. The word "cha" indicates that the salutations also include the Tirthankaras and the great sages, such as the Ganadharas.

**Chapter 1, Verses 21, 22**

**Soma:** Again, what does he do? He says: "External, that which is external, in the form of a vessel or other utensils, internal, that which is characterized by passions, and also the body, etc., along with food, is called 'eating together'. Or, what is the 'condition'? The body, etc., is the 'condition', the living being is established in a difficult situation by this, which is not diligently engaged in, therefore, it is the 'condition'. I renounce, I abandon, all this 'condition' with mind, speech, and body, in terms of its essence. The word 'all' is without case endings due to Prakrit." || 20 ||

**Guna:** External, that which is characterized by a vessel, etc., internal, that which is characterized by passions, etc. The 'condition' is the 'condition' because it nourishes the living being, the body, etc., and 'eating together' is all renounced in terms of its essence with mind, speech, and body. || 20 ||

**All beginnings of life, I renounce, and also deceitful words. All giving and taking, sexual intercourse, and possessions, I renounce. || 21 ||**

**I have equality towards all beings, I have no enmity towards anyone. Abandoning desires, I abide in meditation. || 22 ||**

**Bhuva:** What else does he do? He says: "Now, this pair of verses was already mentioned earlier, why is it repeated? It is said: Earlier, it was said with reference to one who renounces in a concrete way, but here, it is said with reference to one who understands the renunciation of the subtle, therefore, it is not repetition. Then, why is the verse 'I do this' not mentioned? It is said: The meaning of this is already mentioned in the verse 'I rise up, I am free from the dust', therefore, it is not mentioned. The explanation of the pair of verses is the same as before. I take refuge in meditation." || 21-22 ||

**Soma:** Again, what does he do? He says: "This pair of verses was explained earlier, it should be understood in the same way. Now, why is this repeated? It is said: Earlier, it was said with reference to one who renounces in a concrete way, but here, it is said with reference to one who understands the renunciation of the subtle, therefore, it is not repetition. Then, why is the verse 'I do this, I renounce' not mentioned? It is said: The meaning of this is already mentioned in the verse 'I rise up, I am free from the dust', therefore, it is not mentioned." || 21 || 22 ||

**Guna:** The explanation of the pair of verses is the same as before. I take refuge in meditation. || 21-22 ||

Chapter: 1, Verse: 24, 25

I abandon attachment, I am established in non-attachment. My Self is my support, and I abandon the rest. ||24||

I abandon attachment, I am established in non-attachment. My Self is my support, and I abandon the rest. ||24||

Bhuva:  The feeling of "this is mine" is attachment, which is an obstacle to all essential things. I know this through knowledge-cognition, and I abandon it through rejection-cognition. What kind of being am I? I am established in non-attachment, relying on it. Then, what is my support for contemplation? It says: My support is my Self, the cause of my worship, and I abandon the rest, like the body and its accessories. ||24||

Soma:  The feeling of "this is mine" is attachment, which is an obstacle to all things desired by the mind. I know this through knowledge-cognition, and I abandon it through rejection-cognition. What kind of being am I? I am established in non-attachment, freedom from attachment. Then, what is my support for contemplation? It says: My support is my Self, the cause of my worship, and I abandon the rest, like the body and its accessories. ||24||

Gana:  I know attachment, which is an obstacle to essential things, through knowledge-cognition, and I abandon it through rejection-cognition. I am established in non-attachment, relying on it. My support is my Self, the cause of my worship, and I abandon the rest, like the body and its accessories. ||24||

My Self is my support in knowledge, my Self is my support in vision and conduct. My Self is my support in rejection, my Self is my support in restraint and yoga. ||25||

My Self is my support in knowledge, my Self is my support in vision and conduct. My Self is my support in rejection, my Self is my support in restraint and yoga. ||25||

Bhuva:  Then, in what matters is the Self the support? It says: The Self constantly goes to those and those wombs. It is clearly my support in the matter of knowledge. My Self is my support in vision, in right conduct, and also in conduct. Similarly, in rejection, which is the form of knowing the devotee, in restraint, which is the form of accepting all renunciation, and in yoga, which is the form of a well-regulated mind, speech, and body, my Self is my support. Because of this: Knowledge, vision, and conduct are things that can be achieved with help, and they are never separate from the Self. Therefore, by taking up the Self, they are obtained. ||25||

**25.**  It is asked, "In what actions should the self be considered the support?"  The answer is: The self, which constantly goes through various births, is the support in my knowledge and the object of knowledge.  "Hu" (meaning "let it be clear") is the remainder.  The self is also the support in my right view, conduct, and renunciation, as well as in the form of knowledge of the devotees, in restraint, in yoga which is the form of acceptance of all non-violence, and in the form of proper mental, verbal, and bodily activities.  Because these knowledge, right view, and conduct are achieved with the help of the self, and they are never separate from the self.  Therefore, in the previous verse, "My support is the self," the self is considered the support of these as well.

**26.**  The self is my support in the object of knowledge, "Hu" (meaning "let it be clear").  The self is also the support in right view, conduct, renunciation, in the form of knowledge of the devotees, in restraint, in yoga which is the form of acceptance of all non-violence, and in the form of proper mental, verbal, and bodily activities.  Because these knowledge, right view, and conduct are achieved with the help of the self, and they are never separate from the self.  The self is considered the support of these as well.

**26.**  One being wanders, one is born.  One dies, one becomes pure and free from karma.

**26.**  One being wanders, one is born.  One dies, one becomes pure and free from karma.

**26.**  Having abandoned all external and internal conditions, one should contemplate the oneness of the self.  One being wanders, devoid of family, wealth, etc., to another existence.  One is born.  One dies.  One becomes pure and free from karma.

**26.**  One being wanders, devoid of family, wealth, etc., to another existence.  One is born, in the form of humanity, etc.  One dies.  One becomes pure and free from karma.  Although the wandering to another existence and death have the same meaning, they are mentioned separately to emphasize the oneness of the self and to explain the meaning of the individual for those who are unfamiliar with this teaching.

**27.**  One is my eternal self, endowed with knowledge, right view, and restraint.  The rest are external conditions, all marked by attachment.

Bhuva: Only one soul is my eternal companion, the soul endowed with knowledge and vision. All other external things, like children, spouses, etc., are merely artificial associations, characterized by connection. The truth is that for those who are connected, separation is inevitable. ||27||

Soma: Only one soul is my eternal companion, the soul endowed with knowledge and vision. It is this soul that is truly mine. All other external things, like children, spouses, friends, relatives, etc., are merely artificial associations, characterized by connection. They are not eternal, for those who are connected, separation is inevitable. Therefore, they are not truly mine. ||27||

Bhuva: The suffering that arises from connection is experienced by the soul. Therefore, I renounce all connection with all my being. ||28||

Soma: Connection, in the form of relationships with children, spouses, friends, bodies, etc., is the root cause of suffering. This suffering, experienced by the soul, is in the form of countless hardships, such as birth, death, separation from loved ones, and undesirable connections. Therefore, I renounce all connection, all desire for association, with all my being, with my mind, speech, and body. ||28||

Bhuva: What about the root and auxiliary virtues that have been renounced? What about those that have been transgressed? The root virtues are non-violence, etc., and the auxiliary virtues are purity of body, etc. These root and auxiliary virtues, which I have not properly cultivated due to negligence and ignorance, I condemn and will strive to avoid in the future. ||29||

## Chapter 30: Rejection of Impurities

I condemn all my non-observance of the principles, without exception, as a false transgression against my own conscience. I reject the violation of the fundamental and secondary principles, both in the past and the future. For, condemnation of the past, suppression of the present, and rejection of the future are against the teachings. ||29||

**Commentary:**

Now, the text speaks about the rejection of negligence. The fundamental principles are non-violence, etc., and the secondary principles are purity of the body, etc.  Therefore, all the fundamental and secondary principles that I have not observed or have not properly observed due to negligence, ignorance, and other eight types of impurities, I condemn all of them without exception, as a false transgression against my own conscience. I reject the violation of the fundamental and secondary principles, both in the past and the future. This is in accordance with the principles. The meaning is that condemnation of the past, suppression of the present, and rejection of the future are against the teachings. ||29||

**Commentary:**

The fundamental principles are non-violence, etc., and the secondary principles are purity of the body, etc.  All of them that I have not observed or have not properly observed due to negligence, I condemn all of them without exception, as a false transgression against my own conscience. I reject the violation of the fundamental and secondary principles, both in the past and the future. ||29||

**Commentary:**

I condemn the eight types of impurities, the four types of pride, the thirty-three types of desires, and both attachment and aversion. ||30||

**Commentary:**

The seven types of fear, the eight types of pride, the four types of attachment, the three types of pride, the thirty-three types of desires, and both attachment and aversion are condemned. ||30||

**Commentary:**

The seven types of fear are fear of this world, fear of the next world, fear of sudden death, fear of livelihood, fear of death, fear of disgrace, and fear of hell. The eight types of pride are pride in birth, pride in family, pride in strength, pride in beauty, pride in austerity, pride in knowledge, pride in wealth, and pride in fame. The four types of attachment are attachment to food, attachment to fear, attachment to possessions, and attachment to sexual pleasure. The three types of pride are pride in wealth, pride in taste, and pride in beauty. The thirty-three types of desires are the desires for the self, the desires for the teacher, and the desires for the holy ones. I condemn both attachment and aversion. ||30||

**Commentary:**

The seven types of fear are fear of this world, fear of the next world, fear of sudden death, fear of livelihood, fear of death, fear of disgrace, and fear of hell. The eight types of pride are pride in birth, pride in family, pride in strength, pride in beauty, pride in austerity, pride in knowledge, pride in wealth, and pride in fame. The four types of attachment are attachment to food, attachment to fear, attachment to possessions, and attachment to sexual pleasure. The three types of pride are pride in wealth, pride in taste, and pride in beauty. The thirty-three types of desires are the desires for the self, the desires for the teacher, and the desires for the holy ones. I condemn both attachment and aversion. ||30||

The seven types of fear, the eight types of pride, the four types of attachment, the three types of pride, the thirty-three types of desires, and both attachment and aversion are condemned. ||30||

## Āturpratyākhyānaprakirṇakam, Chapter 33

**Thus I consider and inform the Guru of all that was previously mentioned, that which is blameworthy and censurable, and also the veil, illusion, both internal and external. The internal is in the form of the mind's bad intention, and the external is related to the taking of life.**

**I censure that which is censurable, such as the lack of restraint, and I censure that which is censurable, such as the taking of morsels. Thus I consider and inform the Guru of all that is censurable and censurable. And that which exists within is internal, and that which exists outside is external. The veil, illusion, is internal in the form of the mind's bad intention, and external in relation to the taking of life.**

**[Chapter 33-36: Customers who are helpful in criticism]**

**Just as a child, speaking, speaks of what is right and wrong, so too should one consider and, freeing oneself from the illusion of falsehood, speak out.**

**By what method should one consider? Just as a child, unaware and unintelligent, speaking, speaks of what is right and wrong, what should be spoken and what should not be spoken, speaks straightforwardly, with humility and sincerity, to his mother, and does not think, "This is shameful, it should not be spoken, this should be spoken," or "This is hidden, this should be spoken, this is revealed," but, due to his childish nature, does not understand and speaks everything, so too should one consider in the same way, reveal to the Guru the veil, which is in the form of concealment, and falsehood, which is in the form of speaking otherwise, and, freeing oneself from it, abandon it.**

**How should one consider? Just as a child, speaking, speaks of what should be spoken and what should not be spoken, speaks straightforwardly, with humility and sincerity, to his mother, and does not think, "This is shameful, it should not be spoken, this should be spoken," but speaks everything, whether hidden or revealed, so too should one consider in the same way, reveal to the Guru the veil, which is in the form of concealment of sin, and falsehood, which is in the form of speaking otherwise, and, freeing oneself from it, abandon it.**

**By what method should one consider? Just as a child, speaking, speaks of what should be spoken and what should not be spoken, speaks straightforwardly, with humility and sincerity, to his mother, and does not think, "This is shameful, it should not be spoken, this should be spoken," so too should one consider in the same way, reveal to the Guru the veil, which is in the form of concealment, and falsehood, which is in the form of speaking otherwise, and abandon it.**

Chapter: 1 Verse: 34

He is unshakeable in knowledge, perception, conduct and the four elements. He is a wise one, skilled in the scriptures, not a betrayer of secrets. ||34||

**Explanation:**

The qualities of a teacher who is worthy of being consulted are described here:

* **Knowledge:** He is unshakeable in his knowledge of the five types of knowledge. He is a true knower of the scriptures.
* **Perception:** He is unshakeable in his perception of the two types of perception: 
    * **Kshayika-Upashmika:** This refers to the perception of the nature of the world and the path to liberation.
    * **Kshayika-Upashmika:** This refers to the perception of the nature of the soul and its liberation.
    * He is also a knower of the different types of perception, such as the perception of the cause, the effect, the light, and the knowledge of the scriptures.
* **Conduct:** He is unshakeable in his conduct, which is based on the twelve types of austerities. He is capable of performing these austerities himself and also knows how to guide others in performing them.
* **Four Elements:** He is unshakeable in the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air). He is not affected by the changes in these elements.

**Further Explanation:**

* **Unshakeable:** This means that he is not swayed by external influences or temptations. He is firm in his convictions and his practice.
* **Wise:** This means that he has a deep understanding of the scriptures and the principles of Jainism. He is able to apply this knowledge to his own life and to guide others.
* **Skilled in the scriptures:** This means that he is well-versed in the scriptures and can interpret them accurately.
* **Not a betrayer of secrets:** This means that he is trustworthy and will not reveal confidential information.

**Conclusion:**

A teacher who possesses these qualities is worthy of being consulted. He is a true guide who can help us on our path to liberation.

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam Ga. 35**

**Whose?** Of secrets, considered by the examiner, meaning as deep as the ocean, it is said that such a Guru's side is worthy of consideration. ||34||

**Guna** describes the qualities of one whose essence is considered - unwavering and unshakeable in five types of knowledge. Similarly, unshakeable in vision, in pacifying the obstacles, etc. Unshakeable in twelve types of austerities, and in conduct, in Samayika, etc., in all four. The courageous one attains fortitude. Skilled in the scriptures, not prone to contradiction, whose? Of secrets, considered by the examiner. ||34||

**By attachment or by aversion or by ignorance or by carelessness, whatever you have done, I forgive it in three ways.** ||35||

**Bhuka:** If, in any way, the examiner has acted improperly towards the Guru in the past, then it is said - by attachment or by excessive love, by aversion or by carelessness, by a student who has been disliked, by ignorance or by not knowing the qualities of the Guru's kindness, or by carelessness or by not experiencing it, whatever improper action you have done towards the venerable ones, the virtuous ones, I forgive it all. Similarly, any other improper action, like a harsh word or a rebuke, that I have spoken to you, I forgive it all with my mind, speech, and body. ||35||

**Soma:** If, in any way, the examiner has acted improperly towards the Guru in the past, then he forgives it - by attachment or by excessive love, by aversion or by carelessness, by a student who has been disliked, by ignorance or by forgetting the Guru's kindness, by carelessness or by not experiencing it, whatever improper action you have done towards the venerable ones, the virtuous ones, I forgive it all. Similarly, any other improper action, like a harsh word or a rebuke, that I have spoken to you, I forgive it all with my mind, speech, and body. ||35||

[Ga. 37-45 Asamadhimaran and its fruit]

Those who are attached to the eight intoxications, who are of wavering mind, and who are deceitful, die in a state of non-samadhi. They are not called true devotees. || 37 ||

**Commentary on Ga. 37**

Those who are attached to the eight intoxications, who are of wavering mind, and who are deceitful, die in a state of non-samadhi. They are not called true devotees. || 37 ||

Knowing the nature of death as "Bhuva", one should die in a state of samadhi. To show the faults of dying in a state of non-samadhi, the text says: "Those who are attached to the eight intoxications are called 'Ashtamadika'. In the reading 'Attamaiya', 'Rta' means suffering, 'Arta' means the cause of suffering, 'Arta' means suffering in the absence of 'Rta', 'Arta' means suffering in the absence of 'Pita', 'Arta' means suffering in the absence of 'Bhava', 'Arta' means suffering in the absence of 'Mati'. Those who have such a mind are called 'Artamathika'. The suffix 'ika' is used for the sake of emphasis. 'Payaliyasanna' means those whose mind is wavering due to the influence of worldly objects, passions, etc., and who have deviated from the right path. 'Pracalitasanjna' means those whose mind is wavering and unstable. 'Cha' is used for conjunction. 'Vakrabhava' means those who are deceitful, who deceive themselves or others, and who are motivated by worldly gains. Or, 'Vakra' means crooked, 'Vanko' means crooked, and 'Bhava' means those who have such a nature. Since they are of this nature, they die in a state of non-samadhi, which is a state of mental unrest. 'Na hu' means they are not true devotees, they are not the seekers of the highest good. || 37 ||

Knowing the nature of death as "Soma", one should die in a state of samadhi. To show the faults of dying in a state of non-samadhi, the text says: "Those who are attached to the eight intoxications are called 'Ashtamadika'. In the reading 'Attamaiya', 'Aate' means meditation, 'Mati' means those who have such a mind, 'Artamathika'. The suffixes 'ika' and 'ka' are used for the sake of emphasis. 'Pracalita' means those whose mind is wavering due to the influence of worldly objects, passions, etc., and who have deviated from the right path. 'Pracalitasanjna' means those whose mind is wavering and unstable. 'Cha' is used for conjunction. 'Vancyate' means to be deceived, 'Skhalyate' means to stumble, 'Shalyate' means to be wounded, 'Chalyate' means to be moved, 'Atma' means the self, 'Paro' means others, 'Ahikaparatrikalabhad' means worldly and otherworldly gains. 'Vakra' means those who are motivated by such gains. Or, 'Vanko' means crooked, 'Kutilo' means crooked, 'Bhava' means those who have such a nature. Since they are of this nature, they die in a state of non-samadhi, which is a state of mental unrest. 'Na hu' means they are not true devotees, 'Hu' means the same, 'Te' means they are not the seekers of the highest good. || 37 ||

Chapter - 1 Verse - 38, 39

**Verse 38**
Deva-duggati (hell) is difficult to attain due to the karma of the past, and liberation (Bohi) is also difficult to attain. The cycle of birth and death (samsara) is infinite and one will continue to be reborn.

**Verse 39**
What is Deva-duggati? What is Bohi? What is death? How does a soul wander through the infinite and boundless samsara?

## Chapter 40: The Scattering of Eager Rejection

The author will answer the four questions with seven verses. The disciple asks:

1. What is the bad state of the gods (deva-durgati)?
2. What is the state of being unenlightened (abodhi)?
3. How is it that death is accepted again and again, even though it is burdened with the weight of the middle world (madhya-samagata-bharavada-kame)?
4. What is the reason for the endless journey (ananta-para) in the world?

**Note:** Ananta-para can also be interpreted as "the time that has no end" (apara-kala).

**The disciple asks the four questions:**

1. What is the bad state of the gods?
2. What is the state of being unenlightened (abodhi-durgalhata)?
3. How is it that death is accepted again and again, even though it is burdened with the weight of the middle world (madhya-samagata-bharavada-kame)?
4. What is the reason for the endless journey (ananta-para) in the world?

**The disciple asks the four questions:**

1. What is the bad state of the gods (kadeva)?

**The answer:**

The bad state of the gods is the attachment to the sensual pleasures (kandarpa-devakilbisha-abhiyoga), the demonic delusion (asuri-sammoha), and the separation from the true self (marana-virahit).

**Explanation of the first question:**

The author explains that the gods who are attached to sensual pleasures (kandarpa-atthahasa-hasana, kandarpa-karanashila, kandarpa-kandarpa-chideva, kandarpa-deva) will be reborn in a similar state. This is based on the saying "Those who die in pleasure will be reborn in pleasure."

**Examples of the bad state of the gods:**

1. **Laughing and joking:** The gods who laugh and joke (kahakah-kahassa-hasana) are attached to sensual pleasures (kandarpa-anihu-a-yallava).
2. **Talking about sensual pleasures:** The gods who talk about sensual pleasures (kandarpa-kaha-kahana) are attached to the world (kandarpa-uvasa-samsaya).
3. **Being attached to sensual pleasures:** The gods who are attached to sensual pleasures (kandarpa-kukku-yaim, sila-sahava-hasana-vighahaim) are deluded (vimha-avanto) and think about sensual pleasures (kandarpa-bhavana-kunai).
4. **Being attached to the body:** The gods who are attached to the body (bhuna-yana-vayana-dasana-tthaehi, kara-charana-kannama-ai-him) are attached to the world (ta-ta-karei-jah-jah-hasai-para-attano-ahasamiti).

## Chapter 9, Verse 40

This is the state of hell for the lustful. What is sin? Sin is ignorance, greed, and hatred. Due to these, even gods can become sinners. As it is said:

> "Even the wise, the righteous, and the virtuous, if they indulge in lust, they will fall into sin." (1)

This is the state of hell for the gods who are lustful. What is accusation? Accusation is a charge, a lawsuit, a curse, or a spell used to harm others. Due to these, even gods can become accusers. As it is said:

> "Those who indulge in magic, earth-bound karma, and who use spells to harm others, they will fall into the state of accusation." (1) [Uttara 36-262]

This is the state of hell for the gods who are accusers. What is demonic? Demonic is the nature or karma of the demons. Even the demonic gods, who are cruel and angry, are demonic. As it is said:

> "Those who are bound by anger, hatred, and jealousy, they will fall into the state of demonic." (1) [Uttara 36-264]

This is the state of hell for the gods who are demonic. What is delusion? Delusion is to mislead, to deceive, to lead astray from the path of liberation. Those who delude others are deluded. As it is said:

> "Those who lead others astray from the right path, who mislead them with delusion, they will fall into the state of delusion." (1)

This is the state of hell for the gods who are deluded. These are the states of hell for the gods. They will be reborn in hell after death, due to their actions. As it is said:

> "Those who indulge in these actions will fall into the state of hell for the gods. From there, they will fall into the endless ocean of suffering." [Aara Pada 721]

This is the meaning of the verse. (40)

- **First Question:** The answer is: Kandarpa is the god of love, laughter, and joy. Those who are lustful in their previous lives will be reborn as Kandarpa gods. As it is said, "As one dies, so one is reborn." The nature of this state of hell is described in the verses that begin with "Kahkahkahassa hasana." This is the state of hell for the lustful.

- **Second Question:** What is sin? Sin is ignorance, greed, and hatred. Even gods can become sinners due to these. In their previous lives, they were restrained and knowledgeable, but due to their greed and hatred, they were reborn as elephants. This is the state of hell for the sinners.

- **Third Question:** What is accusation? Accusation is a charge, a lawsuit, a curse, or a spell used to harm others. Even gods can become accusers due to these. In their previous lives, they were...

## Āturpratyākhyānaprakirṇakam, Chapter 41

**Verse 41**

**Translation:**

This is the explanation of the question, "What is the state of a deva who is in a state of *duggati* (degeneration)?"

**Explanation:**

* **Āturpratyākhyānaprakirṇakam** is a Jain text that discusses the nature of *duggati* (degeneration) and its causes.
* **Verse 41** explains the nature of *duggati* for devas (celestial beings) who are attached to worldly pleasures and desires.
* **"Kandarpa"** refers to the god of love, and **"Kandarpadeva"** refers to a deva who is attached to sensual pleasures.
* **"Kilbiṣa"** refers to sin or wrongdoing, and **"Kilbiṣika"** refers to a deva who is involved in sinful activities.
* **"Abhiyojana"** refers to accusation or blame, and **"Abhiyoga"** refers to a deva who is accused or blamed.
* **"Asuri"** refers to an asura (a demonic being), and **"Asuri"** refers to a deva who has the characteristics of an asura.
* **"Sammoha"** refers to delusion or illusion, and **"Sammoha"** refers to a deva who is deluded or illusioned.
* **"Miścādasaṇarattā"** refers to those who are attached to false beliefs and views.
* **"Saniyāṇā"** refers to those who are attached to worldly possessions and desires.
* **"Kiṇhalesamogāḍhā"** refers to those who are deeply immersed in the darkness of ignorance.
* **"Dulaha"** refers to something that is difficult to obtain.
* **"Bohi"** refers to enlightenment or liberation.

**The verse states that devas who are attached to worldly pleasures and desires, who are involved in sinful activities, who are accused or blamed, who have the characteristics of asuras, and who are deluded or illusioned are in a state of *duggati*. These devas are likely to be reborn in lower realms after death. For those who are attached to false beliefs and desires, who are deeply immersed in ignorance, enlightenment is difficult to obtain.**

**The verse also emphasizes the importance of avoiding attachment to worldly pleasures and desires, and seeking enlightenment through right knowledge and conduct.**

## Chapter 43: The Scattering of Eager Rejection

Those who are opposed to the Guru, who are full of the 30 *mohas* (delusions), who are strong in the 21 *shabalas* (vices), and who are of corrupt character, they are controlled by their *asamadhi* (lack of concentration) and become eternal wanderers.

**Explanation:**

This chapter answers the fourth question: "How does one cross the infinite?"

The Guru teaches the truth, but those who are opposed to the Guru, like Gosala, reject the Guru's teachings. They are full of the 30 *mohas* and the 21 *shabalas*. They are controlled by their *asamadhi* and become eternal wanderers.

**Note:**

* **Guru:** Spiritual teacher
* **Moha:** Delusion
* **Shabala:** Vice
* **Asamadhi:** Lack of concentration
* **Ananta Samsari:** Eternal wanderer

**Why is the fourth question answered before the third?**

This is done to demonstrate the variety of ways in which the teachings can be presented. It is also done to strengthen the student's understanding.

**Explanation:**

Those who are attached to the words of the Jinas, their minds are filled with their teachings, and they follow the words of the Guru, the teachings of the Dharma Acharya, with devotion, considering them beneficial.

##  Chapter 46:  The Scattering of Eager Rejection

Those who do not know the words of the Jinas, they will die many times in many ways, such as death in childhood, taking up weapons, consuming poison, etc.  They will die, they will die, this is the connection.  Thus, many, many, indeed, are the deaths that are without desire, without longing.  Some, who are afflicted by great diseases, will die out of delusion, not wanting to die.  They are outside the words of the Jinas.  ||45||

Those who do not know the words of the Jinas, they will die many times in many ways, such as death in childhood, taking up weapons, etc.  Thus, many, many, indeed, are the deaths that are without desire, without longing.  Some, who are afflicted by great diseases and suffering, will die even though they do not want to.  They are outside the words of the Jinas.  ||45||

[Chapter 46-47: Death in Childhood] Taking up weapons, consuming poison, burning, and entering water.  Those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, they are bound by birth and death.  ||46||

Taking up weapons, consuming poison, burning, and entering water.  Those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, they are bound by birth and death.  ||46||

**Explanation:** Now, the deaths in childhood are made clear.  There, taking up weapons refers to the placing of a conch shell on the head during pilgrimages, the head-shaving ceremony, etc.  Consuming poison refers to the consumption of poison from the palate, etc., out of detachment.  Entering fire refers to the consumption of wood, the five fires, and entering water refers to immersion in a pilgrimage site, milk, or a bath for the throat, or during the month of Magha.  From the word "etc.", other similar things like tying up, etc., should be understood as death in childhood.  Who will die from these deaths in childhood?  It is said, "Those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness."  Righteous conduct is the behavior prescribed by the scriptures.  The vessel used for that is the vessel of righteous conduct.  It is not the vessel of righteous conduct, but the vessel of unrighteous conduct.  Those who have the habit of serving that are those who serve the vessels of unrighteous conduct.  They are the wandering ascetics, etc., who have false views, or those who serve them through laughter, delusion, etc.  They are the wandering ascetics.

**List of Items:** 1. Pauya, 2. Tidanda, 3. Kundiya, 4. Kanchani, 5. Kesari, 6. Chhatta, 7. Chhannal, 8. Missi, 9. Karodi, 10. Pavitti, 11. Vaththa, 12. Kus, 13. Panah, 14.

**Chapter 48: The Scattering of the Eager Rejection**

**Soma:**  "What will happen to those who die?"

**He says:**  "Above the earth, in the upper realms, extending for a hundred yojanas, and in the lower realms, in the villages and dwellings of the lords of the lower realms, and in the seven earths, and in the realm of the animals, extending for a hundred and eight yojanas, the deaths experienced by living beings, such as death in childhood, unwanted death, death by weapons, etc., or those mentioned earlier, if they are experienced, then what should be done?"

**He says:**  "The क्षपक, knowing the consequences of death in childhood, thinks: 'With the knowledge of the right view and right knowledge, I will die a wise death, a discerning death, as the meaning of the word अनुरथ suggests.'"

**Gun:**  "The upper realm, the lower realm, the villages and dwellings of the lower realms, and in the realm of the animals, extending for a hundred and eight yojanas, the deaths experienced by living beings."

**Soma:**  "Then the teacher, showing the क्षपक the fear of a bad destiny, gives advice: 'O son! For one who has violated the vows, there is a terrible, frightening, and anxiety-inducing thing. What is it? Birth is जाति, death is मरण, and जाति and मरण together are जातिमरण. You will wander in the cycle of existence. This is the conclusion. And in the hells, which torment and call out to the wicked, there are torments such as cutting, piercing, tearing apart with claws, ripping apart with sharp blades, being planted on the top of a शाल्मली tree, embracing a hot iron statue, being drowned in the river Vaitarani, carrying a load of iron sand, and drinking hot iron liquid. These are ten kinds of unbearable torments. Therefore, remembering and contemplating these things, die a wise death, a death of liberation, now.'"

**Gun:**  "Terrible, frightening, and anxiety-inducing. What is it? जाति and मरण. You will wander in the cycle of existence. This is the conclusion. In the hells, there are torments such as cutting, etc. Remembering and contemplating these things."

## Chapter 50: The Scattering of Eager Rejection

**If, due to the violation of the vows taught by the Guru, a feeling of distress arises, then one should contemplate the nature of its origin. This distress is not caused by anything external to the self, but by the self itself. Or, one may think, "How much distress is this? In the past, what was the chain of suffering I experienced? While I was wandering in the world, attached to birth, etc., did I not experience and encounter many things? But I endured them with the strength of non-attachment. The benefit of that endurance was small. Now, because of the attainment of infinite virtues, I should endure with fortitude."**

**Or, if distress arises, what should one do? The answer is: "One should consider this as a friend, a companion, a disease, or a person. What kind of friend is this? One who gives distress. This friend should be observed. What is special about this? I, who am burdened by karma, have not experienced this. Or, what distress have I experienced due to karma? I have not experienced it, not perceived it. What is special about it? While wandering in the world."**

**"In the wheel of the world, all beings have been consumed by me many times. I have not attained satisfaction from those who have been consumed and transformed."**

**"It is not only pain that I have endured while wandering in the world, but also all those things that are the cause of pleasure, all those that have been consumed. Yet, this self of mine remains unsatisfied."**

**"The word 'chakravala' (wheel of the world) refers to the totality of existence. While wandering in this totality, I have consumed all beings, all the aggregates of beings, many times. I have consumed them as food, and I have transformed them through the experience of their taste, or through their transformation into the body, mind, speech, and life force. I have wandered through countless cycles of beings. Yet, I have not attained satisfaction or contentment from all these consumptions."**

**"While wandering in the cycle of existence, I have consumed all beings, all the aggregates of beings, many times. I have consumed them as food, and I have transformed them through the experience of their taste. I have not attained satisfaction or contentment."**

Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam Ga. 53
This is the fault of the eye-sense organ: just as water falls on the ground, so does the ignorant person. ||2|| This is the fault of the nose-sense organ: just as a bee is attracted by a fragrant smell. ||3|| This is the fault of the tongue-sense organ: just as a fish, attracted by a bait, jumps out of the water. ||4|| This is the fault of the touch-sense organ: just as an elephant, attracted by a sweet smell, digs up the ground with its tusks. ||5|| Since this is the fault, therefore, due to the natural tendency of the Tirthankaras and Sadhus, there is a change in gender, and they are unable to desire food with their minds. ||52||
Soma: Then the Kshatriya, thinking about the faults of the vulture in food, says: Food is the cause, food is the cause. Therefore, seeing many fish entering and exiting the mouth of the big fish, the fish think, "If I become like this, then I will eat all of them." Thus, they go to the seventh earth, called Tamas, with a fierce mind. Similarly, the fault of taste is to be understood from the examples of deer, insects, bees, and elephants, as the desire for other objects is rooted in taste. Since this is the fault, therefore, due to the natural tendency of the Sadhus, they are unable to desire food with their minds. They are not virtuous, nor are they logical. The meaning of "na khamati" is that due to the natural tendency, there is a change in gender, and the Jina Sadhus are unable to desire food with their minds. ||52||
Guna: Then he says about the faults of the vulture in food: Due to food, the fish go to the seventh earth. They are unable to desire food with their minds. ||52||
Previously, having done the karma, without any cause, he thought with his mind. Later, he accepted death immediately, being stained with the kshaya. ||53||
Previously, having done the karma, without any cause, he thought with his mind. Later, he accepted death immediately, being stained with the kshaya. ||53||
Bhava: The Kshatriya, having known the result of the object, and having been taught by the Guru, says: Previously, in the beginning, he did the karma, having done the excellent, medium, and inferior karma, in the order of "four varieties", etc.

Chapter: 1 Verse: 54

**Verse 53**

Twelve years, twelve months, twelve fortnights, a detailed account. Without a cause, without a cause.  "Ehiun" (to think) and "Vittal" (to consider) the mind arising at that time, the intellect that is future-oriented and subtle in its understanding, after considering it again.  The one who has purified the passions and subdued the attachments, being ready, quickly accepts death, meaning, I accept it.

**Verse 54**

Those who are not prepared, who are not ready, at the time of death, they fall back due to the influence of their past actions.

**Explanation**

Now, regarding those who are unprepared and do not perform the right actions, and who accept death, the text explains their downfall. Those who perform worship without proper preparation, without a proper occasion, and whose soul has not been prepared for a long time, they are not ready.  (The text uses a grammatical abbreviation due to its Prakrit nature).  These men, who have not performed proper worship, at the time of death, due to the influence of their past actions, they fall back.  They perform actions like "Nandisena" (a mythical figure who performed false worship) and thus they go to hell.  It means, they are like "Kurudo" (a blind person) and "Utkurudo" (a person who is blind and deaf).

**Chapter 55: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager**

**Verse 54**
So, those who undertake fasting without a proper occasion and without having performed the necessary rituals, their downfall is described here: Those who perform worship in the form of fasting without a proper occasion and without a proper time, and those whose souls have been purified by rituals after a long and abundant period of time (i.e., those who have been purified for a long time), and those who are not like this (i.e., those who have not been purified for a long time) - these men, at the time of death, at the time of death (i.e., the word "time" refers to the occasion). The feeling that arises from the karma accumulated in the past, from the completion of that karma, arises from the results of their own natural karma. They fall into falsehood and hell like the Nandiṣa, due to the cause of their actions. They go to hell like the Kuruḍa and the Utkuḍa.

**Verse 55**
Therefore, the Chandrakavedhya should be performed by a man with a proper reason and with a straight mind. The soul, free from all defects, should be made to walk on the path of liberation.

**Explanation**
If there is a fault in those who perform actions without a proper occasion and without having practiced them, then what should be done? The Guru gives the following advice: Therefore, the Chandrakavedhya, which is the piercing of the moon, should be performed by a man with a proper reason. Just as the Chandrakavedhya is performed with a proper reason for the attainment of a kingdom or other benefits, by a prince who has been given a boon by Indra, so also you should perform the Chandrakavedhya, like the Chandrakavedhya, with a proper reason for the attainment of heaven and liberation. Then how should it be performed? It is said: "The soul, free from all defects, should be made to walk on the path of liberation." Where? On the path of liberation, which is the path of knowledge, vision, conduct, and austerity. For it is by following this path that one can perform the Chandrakavedhya.

Chapter: 1 Verse: 56

**Verse 55**

The Guru instructs on what should be done: "Therefore, the moon, which is to be pierced, is like the target in archery, which is to be pierced by an arrow shot upwards from the middle of the wheel, which is rotating clockwise and counterclockwise, and which is reflected in the oil in the earthen pot on the ground. This is the meaning of 'piercing the moon'. It is to be achieved. By whom? By a man. What kind of man? One who is diligent, determined, and careful. How? With a reason, for the sake of attaining heaven, liberation, and wealth. Just as the moon is pierced for the sake of gaining a kingdom, etc., by someone, so too, this moon-like fasting should be done with care for the sake of attaining liberation, etc. This is the means of achieving it."

Just as the moon is pierced for the sake of gaining a kingdom, etc., by someone like a prince who is given by Indra, so too, this moon-like fasting should be done with care for the sake of attaining heaven, liberation, and the lotus of liberation. How then is it to be achieved?"

**Verse 56**

"The soul should be free from external practices and should be devoted to internal meditation. Just as a wise person abandons the body in that time and place, so too, the soul should be free from external practices and should be devoted to internal meditation."

"The soul should be free from external practices and should be devoted to internal meditation. Just as a wise person abandons the body in that time and place, so too, the soul should be free from external practices and should be devoted to internal meditation."

"How should the soul be guided on the path of liberation?" The Guru says: "The soul should be free from external practices, such as external relationships, means of travel, and tools. It should be devoted to internal meditation, such as 'Jin-Saahu-Gun-Kittan', etc. Just as a wise person abandons the body in that time and place, so too, the soul should be free from external practices and should be devoted to internal meditation."

**56.** The one who is not devoid of consciousness abandons the body, meaning the physical form. When the reading is "na hu tammi," then the meaning is this: If one is not free from external yoga in the past and is not engaged in internal meditation yoga, then he will not abandon the body, meaning the physical form, at the time of death, without being confused.

**56.** Soma asks, "How should such a being be in the path of liberation?" He says, "One who is free from external yoga, which is in the form of external connections, means of travel, tools, and other restrictions, and who is engaged in internal meditation yoga, like "jiṇasāhugunakittaṇa," etc., and who is dependent on the "alllīṇo," should be like that." Just as in that place and time, at that moment, he is not confused, not devoid of consciousness, meaning he is mindful, he abandons the body, meaning the physical form. When the reading is "na hu tammi dese kāle," then the meaning is this: If one is free from external yoga in the past and is engaged in internal meditation yoga, then he will not abandon the body, meaning the physical form, at the time of death, without being confused.

**56.** Guṇa asks, "How should a being be in the path of liberation?" He says, "One who is free from external yoga, which is in the form of external connections, means of travel, tools, and other restrictions, and who is engaged in internal meditation yoga, like "jiṇasādhugunakittaṇa," etc., and who is dependent on the "alllīṇo," should be like that." Just as in that place and time, at that moment, he is not confused, not devoid of consciousness, he abandons the body.

**57.** Having conquered attachment and aversion, having broken the chain of eight karmas, [the collection],
Having cut the fetters of birth and death, you will be liberated from existence.

**57.** Having conquered attachment and aversion, having broken the chain of eight karmas, [the collection],

**57.** Bhuk says, "My dear, what will happen to you who are about to abandon your body?" He says, "Having conquered attachment and aversion (singular because of Prakrit grammar) and having broken the chain of eight karmas, 'sankaliam' in the reading, meaning the eight karmas, the fetters of birth and death, meaning birth, old age, and death, the fetters of birth, old age, and death, in which the beings of the world, bound by the mass of karma, wander like a tied goat. Even among them, some who are careless wander and, having broken the garland of virtues, fall into the hellish pit and suffer intense pain. Those who wander without carelessness, having been showered with the teachings of the guru, are free from bondage and attain the auspicious path that leads to liberation in all aspects. Having cut such fetters of birth, old age, and death, my dear, you will be liberated from existence."

**57.** Soma says, "My dear, what will happen to you who are about to abandon your body?" He says, "Having conquered attachment and aversion (singular because of Prakrit grammar) or because of the duality of the collection, and having broken the chain of eight karmas, 'sankaliam' in the reading, meaning the eight karmas,

Chapter: 1 Verse: 58

"This chain of eight karmas, you will break it, that is the meaning."  The cycle of birth and death is a collision, a collision of birth and death, breaking through it, you will be liberated from the world, dear one! This is the meaning: In the collision of birth and death, the souls of the world, bound by the mass of karma, wander like a tied animal, constantly. Even among them, those who are careless wander, consuming the garland of qualities, fall into the well of hell, and endure intense suffering. Those who wander without carelessness, purified by the rain of the Guru's teachings, free from bondage, attain the auspicious path, the path to liberation in all aspects. Thus, you too will be liberated, that is the meaning. ||57||

"And, dear one, what will happen to your body after death?"  Breaking the chain of eight karmas, the souls of the world, bound by the mass of karma, wander like a tied animal, constantly. Even among them, those who are careless wander, consuming the garland of qualities, fall into the well of hell, and endure intense suffering. Those who wander without carelessness, purified by the Guru's teachings, free from bondage, attain the auspicious path, the path to liberation in all aspects.

Even in that time and place, the twelve-fold *Shruta-skandha* cannot be fully comprehended. Even with a strong mind, it is difficult to contemplate all of it. ||59||

**Explanation:**

It has been said that a *jiva* should be endowed with virtues by the *gurus*. This is achieved through contemplation of the *Shruta*. How much should one contemplate? The text says: "Even in that time and place, when the bonds are loosening, the tongue falters, and the power of hearing is waning, the twelve-fold *Shruta-skandha* cannot be fully comprehended. Even with a strong mind, it is difficult to contemplate all of it." ||59||

Chapter: - 1 Verse: 61, 62

**Verse 60**
When a person studies the words of the Gatha, which are the purpose of studying the Angas, he attains the emotion of liberation, which is the desire for liberation, continuously and constantly. This death is the attainment of emotion, and it is by this means that one should die.

**Verse 61**
Therefore, even if a person contemplates a single verse, which is the form of a single verse or a single word, at the time of death, he becomes a devotee.

**Verse 62**
A devotee who has properly spent his time, having become fit for devotion, attains liberation by going to the three excellent states.

**Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam Ga. 63**

By making time, being well-behaved, virtuous, and performing excellent and extraordinary right worship, one attains liberation (nirvana) after passing through three existences. This means that if one makes time with utmost dedication, then one will definitely attain liberation in the third existence. 

Someone else says that one attains liberation by performing Samayika within eight existences. This is neither excellent nor inferior. How is there no contradiction? It is said that this statement is based on the understanding of the true nature of the principles. 

The statement that one attains liberation in the lowest existence by passing through only one existence is based on the Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana. This is said by accepting the Chhedaprustha-Samhanana. The Chhedaprustha-Samhanana, if it performs excellent worship, attains liberation in the third existence. The word "excellent" here refers to extraordinary. It is not accepted by the Bhavan. If the Bhavan is accepted, then the Chhedaprustha-Samhanana attains liberation in eight existences. Therefore, there is no contradiction.

**Soma**

Now, the fruit of the worshipper is explained. The worship is performed with the understanding of the highest meaning. It means that one is dedicated and careful. By making time, being well-behaved, virtuous, and performing excellent and extraordinary right worship, one attains liberation (nirvana) after passing through three existences. This means that if one makes time with utmost dedication, then one will definitely attain liberation in the third existence. 

Someone else says that one attains liberation by performing Samayika within eight existences. This is neither excellent nor inferior. How is there no contradiction? It is said that this statement is based on the understanding of the true nature of the principles. 

The statement that one attains liberation in the lowest existence by passing through only one existence is based on the Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana. This is said by accepting the Sevarta-Samhanana. The Sevarta-Samhanana, if it performs excellent worship, attains liberation in the third existence. The word "excellent" here refers to extraordinary. The special characteristic of worship should be observed. It is not accepted by the Bhavan. If the Bhavan is accepted, then the Sevarta-Samhanana attains liberation in eight existences. Therefore, there is no contradiction.

**Guna**

What is the fruit of the worshipper? By performing worship with the understanding of the highest meaning, one is dedicated. By making time, being well-behaved, virtuous, and performing excellent and extraordinary right worship, one attains liberation (nirvana) after passing through three existences. This means that if one makes time with utmost dedication, then one will definitely attain liberation in the third existence.

**Samano**

I am a Shraman, I am restrained everywhere. I renounce everything. This is said in summary.

**Bhuva**

Knowing the fruit of worship, with what intention does one renounce everything? First, I am a Shraman.

**Chapter 1, Verse 64**

**Commentary:**

The क्षपक (a person who has renounced the world) contemplates and says: "I, a श्रमण (a renunciant), have accepted the महाव्रत (the five great vows) and have experienced the sorrow of the world (संसारखेद). Secondly, I am restrained (संयतो) with my senses controlled (निगृहीतेन्द्रिय) due to the constant practice of समितगुप्त (the vow of non-attachment). Therefore, for me, who am like this, what is the need for any restrictions (प्रतिबन्ध) or desires for food (आहाराभिलाष)? I renounce all of this. This is the essence of the क्षपक's contemplation."

**Verse 64:**

"I have obtained the Jinavacana (the teachings of the Jinas), which is unparalleled and like nectar. Having embraced the path of liberation, I do not fear death."

**Commentary:**

The क्षपक further contemplates and says: "I have obtained (लब्धं) the Jinavacana (the teachings of the Jinas), which was previously unattainable (अलब्धपूर्वं). In my past lives, I never experienced such teachings. What is special about it? It is well-spoken (सुभाषितं) and profound (अतिशयेन भाषितं). How is it like that? It is like nectar (अमृतभूतं), like food for the gods (देवभोज्यतुल्यम्). Or, the Jinavacana itself is the special thing, and it is also unparalleled (अलब्धपूर्वम्). As it is said:

"The wealth of the gods, the splendor of the palaces, the riches of the earth, all are easily attainable. But the Jinavacana, the teachings of the Jinas, is difficult to obtain."

Also, it is like nectar (अमृतभूतं) because it is the cause of supreme happiness (परमसुखहेतुत्वात्) and destroys old age and death (वलिपलितजराविघातकत्वाच्च). Therefore, I have embraced (गृहीतो) the path of liberation (सुगतिमार्गो) and I do not fear death (मरणाद्विभेमीत्यर्थः)."

**64.** Soma again, as the क्षपक (skeptic) contemplates, says: "The obtained, the attained, which was not obtained before, was not obtained by me before, in the past, while I was wandering in this existence. I have never experienced this object of worship." What is special? It is well and truly stated in the Jina's words, in the सिद्धान्त (principle). How is it so? The word "भूत" (being) is used in the sense of a simile, meaning "like nectar," because it is the cause of the supreme state, and because it destroys old age, death, etc. Or, the special word is the Jina's well-spoken word. That too is "not obtained before, obtained, like nectar," because this is obtained, therefore the path of good fortune, the path of liberation, is taken by me, therefore I do not fear death now. Due to its being in the Prakrit language, the sixth case is used in the sense of the fifth case.

**65.** The क्षपक (skeptic) again, contemplating, says: "The obtained, the attained, which was not obtained before, was not obtained by me before, while I was wandering in this existence. I have never experienced this object of worship." The Jina's well-spoken word is "like nectar," like food for the gods, the path of good fortune, the path of liberation, is taken by me. I do not fear death now.

**65.** "Even the brave must die, even the coward must die. Both must die, but it is better to die with courage."

**65.** Even the brave, even the good warrior, must die. Even the coward, the one without courage, the fearful one, must die. Both must die, it is clear. Therefore, it is better to die with courage, with determination.

**65.** Even the brave, even the good warrior, must die. Even the coward, the one without courage, the fearful one, must die. Both must die, it is clear. Therefore, it is better to die with courage, with determination.

**65.** Even the brave, even the good warrior, must die. Even the coward, the fearful one, must die. Both must die, it is clear. Therefore, it is better to die with courage, with determination.

**66.** "Even the virtuous must die, even the non-virtuous must die. Both must die, but it is better to die with virtue."

**66.** Even the virtuous must die, even the non-virtuous must die. Both must die, but it is better to die with virtue.

Chapter: 1 Verse: 67

**Verse 66**

A person is considered virtuous due to his conduct and good character. One should be committed to one's vows, even if they are difficult to keep. One should also be committed to one's vows, even if they are broken. One should be committed to one's vows, even if they are difficult to keep, and even if they are broken. Therefore, it is better to be virtuous and committed to one's vows.

**Verse 67**

Whoever, possessing right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, will make use of them, will be liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

**Commentary**

The teacher, having established the point, explains the general principles through five verses, using the fruit as a means of explanation. The five verses explain the special use of knowledge, the general use of faith, the eight types of right faith, and the eight types of conduct, which are classified according to their secrecy and openness. Whoever, being virtuous, will make use of these, will be liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

## Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam, Chapter 71

One who knows old age and death is called Jaramarana-vit. One who gives wisdom and intelligence to all the worthy beings is called Dhira. One who knows the special knowledge, the Kevala-jnana, which is the form of special understanding, is called Jnana. The same is the form of general understanding [Kevala-darshan]. One who is endowed with both is called Samyukta. He is the illuminator of the fourteen-rayed world. The meaning is that he should direct, do, and destroy all sins and all karmas. When, however, it is read as Vira in another reading, then he inspires and motivates the eight types of karma, and he is the last Tirthankara. The rest is the same. In this text, the name of the author is also secretly revealed. Because, it is heard that Virabhadra is the author of this Prakirnakam. Due to the transfer of the knowledge of the devotees, it is clear that it was done by him. Therefore, it is known that he is the author of this too. || 71 || End of the explanation of Aaturpratyakhyan. || 6 ||

## Chapter 90

-

If I have said anything contrary to this explanation, then it should be corrected by the wise, with compassion towards me. || 1 ||

May the grace of the great teacher, Sri Dharmaghosa Suri, the essence of the omniscient teachings, be victorious. || 6 ||

The renowned and wise Aryarakshita Suri, the expounder of the Dharma, was previously the teacher of Sri Jayasimha Suri, the abode of peace. || 1 ||

Sri Dharmaghosa Suri, the sun of the mountain of the lineage, was his successor. From him, Mahendra Suri, who dispelled the false doctrines, was born. || 2 ||

Sri Bhuvanatunga Suri, from him, did the favor of writing this explanation of the Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam. || 3 ||

If anything false has been said here by me, due to my foolishness in great matters, then it should be corrected by the wise, especially with compassion towards me. || 4 ||

|| End of the praise of the explanation of Aaturpratyakhyan. || The number of verses is 850. || Sri ||

|| This Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam, composed by Sri Virabhadragani, along with the commentary by Sri Bhuvanatunga Suri of the Anchalika Gaccha, has been edited and revised in the year 2066 of the Vikrami era by Vijayakirtiyasasuri. ||

Soma: Now, at the end of the study, the author of the text says, "One who is wise and rules with intelligence is called Dhira, the Tirthankara. Old age, aging, and death are called Jaramarana. One who knows old age and death is called Jaramarana-vit."

Chapter - 1 Verse - 71

**Meaning:** One who knows the nature, destruction, etc. of the soul.  The word "Dheer" is an epithet, meaning one who gives joy (rati) to the intellect (dhi) of all the worthy ones.  "Kevalgyan" is the special knowledge, the knowledge of the form of special understanding (visheshavabodharoopa).  "Kevaldarshan" is the knowledge that is known (gyanate), the knowledge of the form of general understanding (samanavabodharoopa).  One who is endowed with both of these.  One who illuminates the fourteen-stringed world (loka) with the illumination of the substance (dravyaodyota) and the illumination of the Kevala-light (kevalalokabhavodyota), and thus illuminates the world (lokoodyotakara) always.  May he direct, may he do, the destruction (kshaya) of all the miseries (durita), all the sins (papa), all the karmas.  When "Veer" is read in the alternative reading, then it means one who inspires (ireyate), motivates (prereyate) the eight types of karma, and is a Veeracharama-tirthakrit.  This is the word to be qualified (visheshya), the rest are the qualifiers (visheshana).  In this text, the name of the author (shastrakara) is also secretly revealed (guptamunta).  Because, even of this "Prakirnak" (collection of verses), Veerabhadra is heard to be the good author (sadhu karta) in the "Bhaktaparijna" (knowledge of devotees) written by him.  It is known from the over-emphasis (atideshakarana) in the study of this text that he is the author of this also.  This is the meaning.  || 71 ||

Thus ends the "Avchurini" (commentary) done by Shri Somasundarasuripada, the supreme guru (paramguru) of the Shri Gachchhesha Bhattaraka, according to the commentary (vritti) written by Shri Mahendrasuri, the disciple of Shri Dharmaghossuri.  May it be auspicious for the Shri Sangha.  || 6 ||

This "Aturapratyakhyan Prakirnak" (collection of verses on the rejection of the sick) written by Shri Veerabhadragani, along with the "Avchurini" (commentary) written by Shri Somasundarasuri, has been edited and published by Vijayakirtiyasuri in the year 2066 of the Vikrami era.  ||

**Gunaratna Suri's Commentary:**

Dheer is one who rules (rajate) with intellect (dhi), a Tirthakrit, one who knows (vetti) old age and death (jaramarana), the end of old age (vridhatvanidhana).  Dheer is one who gives joy (rati) to the intellect (dhi) of all the worthy ones.  "Kevalgyan" is the special knowledge (vishistam gyanam), "Kevaldarshan" is the knowledge that is known (gyanate), the same knowledge in the form of general understanding (samanavabodharoopa).  One who is endowed with both of these.  One who illuminates the fourteen-stringed world (loka) with the illumination of the substance (dravyaodyota) and the illumination of the Kevala-light (kevalalokabhavodyota), and thus illuminates the world (lokoodyotakara) always.  May he direct, may he do, the destruction (

Chapter - 2, Collection of Examples within the Discourse on Miscellaneous Sayings: 1. The story of Ashakata's father, who was ignorant and heedless, from the scriptures on the conduct of the Sangha. A certain Suri, being negligent, became devoid of knowledge after death. He was reborn in the same family, like a pearl from the ocean of knowledge. ||1|| Thus, in a certain family of monks, residing on the banks of the Ganga, two brothers took vows and became peaceful. One of them was very knowledgeable. ||2|| He became a Suri, and was constantly served by his disciples who sought the essence of the scriptures. He spent every day in service, never taking rest. ||3|| Even at night, he did not get restful sleep, being constantly engaged in contemplation and answering questions about the scriptures. ||4|| His other brother, however, always lived comfortably. Seeing him, the Suri, filled with a sense of inferiority, thought: ||5|| "Oh, how fortunate my brother is, who lives happily always. Due to his lack of knowledge and wisdom, he will not be afflicted by any suffering." ||6|| "I, on the other hand, have attained knowledge like a sharp sword, and will not be afflicted by any suffering. This has been explained to me by a wise person." ||7|| "My friend, ignorance is indeed pleasant for me, and for him too. He has eight qualities: 1-He is carefree, 2-He eats a lot, 3-He is not concerned about others, 4-He sleeps day and night, 5-He is blind and deaf to the consideration of right and wrong actions, 6-He is indifferent to honor and dishonor, 7-He is mostly free from fear, 8-He is strong and foolish, and lives happily." ||8|| "He does not contemplate the nectar-like essence of various scriptures, nor does he enjoy the company of learned people. Their days pass by in the pursuit of knowledge, their minds unburdened. Their birth and life are fruitful, adorned by them. What is the use of others, who are like animals, devoid of discrimination, and a burden to the world?" ||9|| "Thus, filled with hatred for knowledge, he desired knowledge. With a wicked mind, he committed an act that destroyed knowledge due to his negligence." ||10|| "Without considering the consequences of violating the principles of knowledge and conduct, he became a god in the celestial realm, due to the influence of his past actions." ||11|| "He fell from that family into a family of Abhiras, and was born as a son in Bharata. He married a girl of his own caste, who was like his own self, to his parents." ||12|| "One day, a beautiful and virtuous daughter was born to him. She reached youth, captivating the hearts of young men." ||13|| "Her father, wanting to sell ghee, left her at home and went to the city with the Abhiras." ||14|| "Seeing her, the young men lost their minds and their senses. They strayed from the path, and fell down somewhere." ||15|| "They gathered together, and seeing her, they called her Ashakata, Ashakata-pita, again and again." ||16||

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam

**17.** Hearing this, the dispassion of the one with small karma arose. Having given his daughter in marriage to someone, and given him wealth and other things, 

**18.**  he went out to some place, and brought the Yoga-udvahana.  He diligently studied the three Uttara-adhyayana, which were very clear.

**19.**  He also studied the Turya-adhyayana, which is called "Asanskruta", with ease.  From that, the karma-udaya arose, which is called "Jnana-avaraneya".

**20.**  For two days, he studied that, and he did not speak to anyone, even though he was in great distress due to the other obligations.

**21.**  Then, he was asked by his teachers, "What is it that you are allowed to do?"  He said, "O Bhagavan, what is Yoga?"  Then the teacher said,

**22.**  "As long as you do not reach this, you will be in the Aachama state."  He said, "I have already done that, by listening and by penance."

**23.**  Then he performed the Aachama, for twelve years, with great concentration.  He destroyed his karma with ease, and he enjoyed the knowledge he had gained.

**24.**  He also quickly studied the remaining scriptures.  He was a great intellect, and he became a devotee of the scriptures.  He became happy everywhere, both in this world and the next.

## 2. An example of Anaachaara-dhyana from the Konkana Sadhu, from the Sri Kalpasutra Subodhikaatika

Just as a merchant from the Konkana region, who had become a monk in his old age, once stayed for a long time in a place where the Aryapathis were being cremated.  He was asked by his teachers, "What have you been thinking about during this long time of cremation?"  He replied, "Swamin! I have been thinking about the welfare of living beings."  When asked how, he said, "In my previous life as a householder, I had many grains of rice, which were obtained after cutting down trees in the fields.  Now, if my sons do not cut down trees, how will they have rice, and how will they be able to live?"  He spoke truthfully, and expressed his opinion as it was.  The teacher said, "O great one! You have misunderstood.  This is not right for a Yati."  He was then given a false punishment.

## 2-14.  An example of Anaachaara-dhyana and Sankha-dhyana, from the story of the Aashada-sura, who wanted to renounce the world, but the gods did not come to him, from the Srimad Bhava Vijayakrita Sri Uttara-adhyayana Sutra Vritti

**1.**  In the land of Vatsa, there were many learned teachers with many disciples.  The Acharya, named Aryashada, was loved by all.

**2.**  Whoever in their group was devoted, they rejected them and they suffered.  Those suns said, "We will take you out of this world, without any scriptures."

**3.**  They said, "You must give me your darshan, quickly, because I am in the Deva-bhavana state."  Even though they said this, none of them went to heaven.

**4.**  Then, one day, they said to their beloved disciple, "We will take you out of this world."  They said this with great force, and their words were choked with emotion.

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

Those who are devoted to knowledge, vision, conduct, and worship are peaceful in mind. They are free from the prescribed fasts, are righteous in their conduct, and are liberated themselves. ||9||

Those who have accepted my words and those who have died, who are dear to me, how can they not come to me? [Pair. ||10||

Whatever he did today, the action was useless and painful. Giving up enjoyable pleasures, my soul has been cheated in vain! ||11||

Having enjoyed pleasures, I will make this life fruitful. For in the afterlife, who is troubled in vain by a skilled person? ||12||

Reflecting on this, he relied on his own sign, which is false. Desiring to renounce the world, he left his home and went away. ||13||

In the meantime, from the knowledge of the omniscient, he learned the nature of his teacher. Knowing this, the disciple went to heaven, and being distressed, he meditated. ||14||

Oh! My teachers, even though they are endowed with the eyes of Jain scriptures, they abandon the path of liberation, being overwhelmed by the darkness of delusion! ||15||

Oh! The greatness of delusion, conquering the world, is flourishing. Like the blind, all people act, even though they see! ||16||

Even though he is of a good family, even though he is courageous, even though he is profound, even though he is wise, delusion destroys his limits, like the ocean at the end of a kalpa. ||17||

As long as people are driven by delusion and commit evil deeds, I will continue to enlighten them, making them follow the righteous path! ||18||

Meditating, he came to the place where his teacher had gone. He performed a divine play in a village on the bank of a river. ||19||

Then that sage, seeing that beautiful play, was filled with joy for six months. ||20||

He saw that play, enduring the cold, heat, wind, thirst, and the fatigue of six months. ||21||

In that dance, the god, being united, stood still in front of him. For a moment, he thought, "I have seen a good play, a good fortune." ||22||

Then that god, wanting to test those who were not yet enlightened, created six children in the forest, each representing one of the six types of living beings. ||23||

Seeing the first of them, adorned with many ornaments, the sage thought, "I will cut off the ornaments of this child and use them for my own enjoyment." ||24||

"With the wealth of these ornaments, my desire for enjoyment will be fulfilled for a long time. Without wealth, the desire for water in a mirage is like a thirst for water in a mirage." ||25||

Reflecting on this, he said to the child with a milk-white throat, "Hey! Give up your ornaments!" But the child did not give them up. ||26||

Then, angry, he grabbed the child by the neck. The child, frightened, stammered, "In this terrible forest, I am afraid of thieves and other dangers. I am a 'prithvi-kaya' (earth-bodied being), and I have taken refuge in you." ||27||

"These lives are impermanent, but fame is eternal. Even at the cost of life, one should protect those who have taken refuge. ||29||

"Protect me, protect me, Lord! I am a helpless child." Then, those who were adorned with ornaments protected the one who had taken refuge. ||30||

For, "He who supports the fallen, he who rescues

Even though he was told this, the greedy soul, that Sūri, was eager to take his necklace. As long as he was attached to taking it, the cub again spoke. ||32||
“O Bhagavan, one should act appropriately after hearing a story. Sūri said, “Tell me, then.” The cub said, “Listen.” ||33||
“Once upon a time, there was a potter in a village, and he was digging a pit. He was attacked by the collapsing edge of the pit, and he said, “I give alms and offerings to please the gods, and I support my relatives. But the earth is attacking me. I have found refuge from fear!” ||34-35||
“Just as a potter, who is seeking the main happiness of livelihood, depends on the earth, so too was this potter quickly harmed by it! ||36||
“O Bhagavan, I am also afraid, and I have taken refuge in you. You will save me from this fear. I have found refuge from fear!” ||37||
“You are very clever, little one!” said the Guru. He took the ornaments and took the child. ||38||
He threw the remaining ornaments into his own alms bowl. Even though he was clever, he was overcome by his vow, and he became completely devoid of greed. ||39||
Then, going forward, the Guru crossed a forest. He saw a second cub, named Apkāya, and he spoke to him as before. ||40||
He was about to take the ornaments from this one too, but the cub, having declared his own name, told a story. ||41||
“There was once a storyteller named Pāṭala, who was skilled in telling beautiful stories. He was full of witty sayings. ||42||
“Once, he was crossing the Ganges, which was flowing with a full current. He saw the people standing on the bank, and he said to them in amazement, ||43||
“‘The Ganges carries Pāṭala, who is full of stories. It is good that you are being carried. Tell me something witty.’ ||44||
“The people, who were eager to hear, said, ‘Pāṭala, tell us a verse that is not obscene.’ Pāṭala said, ||45||
“‘By which seeds grow, by which farmers live, in the midst of that, I have found refuge from fear!’ ||46||
“Having revealed his feelings and told the story, the cub stood there. Sūri, abandoning compassion, took the ornaments from him too. ||47||
Then, going further, he saw a third cub, named Tejaska. Sūri was about to take his ornaments. ||48||
Then, that cub, as before, revealed his own name and began to tell a story, displaying his eloquence. ||49||
“Once upon a time, there was an ascetic in an ashram who worshipped fire every day. He never burned anything else in his fire. ||50||
“‘I satisfy him with honey and ghee day and night. I have been burned by that fire. I have found refuge from fear!’ ||51||
“‘Once, someone went into the forest and lit a fire at night because he was afraid of a tiger. He was careless and was burned by it. He said, ||52||
“‘I was afraid of a tiger, and I took refuge in the fire. I was burned by it. I have found refuge from fear!’ ||53||
“Having told the story and revealed its meaning, the cub stood there. Then,

"There was once a young man, very strong and stout. He was afflicted with a wind disease. Seeing him, someone asked, "57.

"You, who were once a strong swimmer and walker, now go about leaning on a stick. What disease afflicts you?" 58.

"The eldest of the Maruts, who brings happiness in the month of Ashadha, is the one who troubles me. I have found fear in my refuge!" 59.

"Calling it a story, and reflecting on it as before, the teacher took the ornaments from the child who was standing there. 60.

"Again, in front of the child, he was adorned with ornaments as before. He saw the fifth, named Vanaspatika. 61.

"The teacher was eager to take the ornaments from him too. He also told a story, after telling his own story. 62.

"In a tree with flowers and fruits, some birds lived. They were confident, thinking, "This tree is our refuge." 63.

"While they lived there, they were undisturbed. Their many young ones played and grew. 64.

"From the side of that tree, a creeper grew up. It encircled the tree and climbed high above it. 65.

"On that creeper, a large snake slithered. Climbing the tree, it devoured the young birds. 66.

"Then, the birds, distressed by the destruction of their young, made a great noise and said to each other again and again, 67.

"Until today, we were happy in the tree, living here without trouble. Now, from this creeper-laden tree, we have found fear in our refuge!" 68.

"Having told this story, and showing the meaning as before, he gave the ornaments to the child who was standing there. 69.

"Then, he went on to the sixth, a child named Trasaka. Seeing his ornaments, he was eager to take them. 70.

"After telling his own story, he told the fourth story. He said that the four senses are possible there. 71.

"For example, in a city, surrounded by enemies, the frightened elephants entered the city quickly from outside. 72.

"Those who were inside the city, fearing the sound of the elephants, drove them out. They were greatly harassed by the enemies. 73.

"Thinking, "The city will be our refuge," they entered. Seeing their plight, someone asked, 74.

"The frightened citizens are harassing you, and the enemies are chasing you. Go somewhere else, elephants! You have found fear in your refuge!" 75.

"With the same explanation as before, even after telling this story, the teacher released the child and told the second story. 76.

"In a city, there was a king, who was wicked and his people were wicked. He always caused theft in his own city. 77.

"The king's priest deceived all the people. All the people were distressed and spoke to each other. 78.

"Where the king himself is a thief, and the priest is a deceiver, go away, citizens! You have found fear in your refuge!" 79.

"He told this story with the same explanation as before. He did not release the child, like a wicked planet seizing people! 80.

"Then, the child was about to tell the third story. "For example, in a village, there was a Brahmin who was lustful. 81.

He, having built a temple and a garden for the sake of his own welfare, performed a goat sacrifice and repeatedly did so there. ||107||
"This is my religious practice, it will be my salvation in the next world," thinking thus, he sacrificed many goats in the sacrifices. ||108||
That Bhūdeva, having died, was reborn as a goat. That goat, by gradual increase, became fat and strong. ||109||
When he was being led to be killed in the sacrifice, he remembered his own kind, seeing his own pond and so on, by his own sons. ||110||
"This was done by me, it has become a calamity for me," thus blaming his own actions, he repeatedly made the sound "bubū". ||111||
Seeing him thus, a wise great sage, knowing his previous birth story, said this. ||112||
"This pond and the trees were planted by you, the sacrifices were performed by you, why are you making the sound "bubū", O animal!" ||113||
Hearing these good words, that goat took refuge in silence, thinking, "What is the use of rewards when my actions have borne fruit?" ||114||
"This one, who is silent, is a good man, he is not born of a mother," thinking thus, the twice-born ones were filled with wonder and asked. ||115||
"O venerable one, what is this ram doing, having heard your words? He has become silent, as if he has been subdued by a spell?" ||116||
"O venerable one, this one was a cow in your previous birth, he has become a goat. Seeing this pond and so on, he remembered his own kind." ||117||
"Then, remembering his suffering, he made the sound "bubū" loudly, knowing the fault of his own actions, he quickly became silent." ||118||
"Then his offspring said, "What is the proof here, O master? Without proof, who would believe what is unseen?" ||119||
"The good man has said in your presence, it is hidden in his previous birth. If he shows you the treasure, then this will be true." ||120||
Hearing this, his sons said, "Show us the place of the treasure." The goat went to the place of the treasure and dug the earth with his forefoot. ||121||
Then, his sons, having gained faith, in the presence of the sage, that goat renounced his goathood and embraced Jainism. ||122||
Hearing the Dharma from the sage, that ram also embraced it. He immediately became a vegetarian and attained the state of a god. ||123||
Just as a twice-born one, with the intention of "I will be his refuge after death", built a pond and so on, he went to his refuge. ||124||
"Thus, I, being afraid, have taken refuge in you. If they kill me, then I have also gone to your refuge." ||125||
Even with these four stories told by the teacher, his bad nature did not cease, like an incurable disease with medicines. ||126||
Then, the sage, as before, took his ornaments. A greedy person is never satisfied with wealth, like the ocean with water. ||127||
Thus, that one, with the ornaments of the six princes, took upon himself the acceptance of gifts, which were difficult to choose. ||128||
Then, the sage quickly, quickly, started to go forward, thinking, "I will connect these children with

## The Scattering of Eager Refusal

A woman with beautiful eyes, adorned with many ornaments and marked with a tilak, said to the sage, "O virtuous one, who are you and from where have you come?" (132)

Hearing the words, "He is Surya," she was filled with anger and, without hesitation, quickly replied to him. (133)

"O Surya! Do you see mustard seeds and holes? Even though you see your own self as small as a bilva fruit, you do not see it?" (134)

"And, teaching others in this way, one who is faultless indeed shines. But one who is himself full of faults is not worthy of teaching!" (135)

"If you consider yourself a Shraman, a Brahmachari, a worthy recipient of gold, a well-behaved and austere one, (136)

then come with me, why are you perishing? I will see, O elder lady, how I can accept your offering." (137)

Thus urged by the virtuous woman, he remained silent and went forward. He saw the army approaching, which had been created by the Yaksha himself. (138)

Frightened, Surya abandoned the path of the army. Even though he was perishing, he was saved by the grace of fate. (139)

The king, seeing him, got down from his elephant and bowed. He said, "Oh, what good fortune! You have graced us with your presence!" (140)

"Please accept these sweets and other offerings as a token of my gratitude. Take them quickly!" (141)

"I will not eat today," Surya said loudly, refusing to accept the offerings. He was thinking, "Let the heap of ornaments in the bowl be seen!" (142)

"Release him, release him!" the king urged, but out of fear, he did not release him. Like a young woman who refuses to release her lover, he was hesitant to let go. (143)

Even though the king repeatedly pulled at Surya's hand, he did not release him. Like a young woman who refuses to release her garment, he held on tight. (144)

Then, forcefully, the king cut off Surya's hand and the offering fell to the ground. As the king was about to throw the sweets and other offerings, (145)

Surya, seeing his ornaments scattered, became very angry. With a furrowed brow and a stern face, he spoke to the king. (146)

"You wicked one! You must have killed my sons. Otherwise, how could these ornaments be near you?" (147)

"O wicked one! O hateful one! O most sinful one! You hypocrite in the guise of a virtuous one! How will you live after killing my sons?" (148)

Hearing the king's words, the sage's mind was filled with sorrow. With a heavy heart, he thought, "Oh, I have done a terrible thing! (149)

I have taken these ornaments from the king's sons! My sin is known to this king. He will surely kill me with one of his sons!" (150)

"The fruit of all my sins has come to pass. Who will be my refuge now?" (151)

"Or perhaps I acted rashly without thinking. I abandoned the peace of restraint for the sake of worldly pleasures." (152)

While he was thinking thus, Surya, gathering his magic, appeared with his body shining brightly, illuminating the sky. (154)

"O revered one!" he said, "I am your beloved disciple. I myself will go

## Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

**105**

Some time was spent in the arrival of Madan, which should be known to be due to his being engrossed in the work of the newly born god. ||157||

To enlighten you, whose minds have been corrupted by restraint, I have enacted this play, which is unseen by the venerable ones in this world! ||158||

Six children, called the Six Bodies, were refined by me for the purpose of testing you, along with their female companion. ||159||

Then, understanding your nature, quickly overcome by delusion and madness, I presented the fear of the army, the medicine for its destruction. ||160||

Abandoning this doubt and fear, filled with delusion, turn your mind, which has gone astray, towards the true path. ||161||

Furthermore, "Those who are attached to the world, who are engrossed in worldly pleasures, who are not free from the smallest particle of karma, do not attain liberation, even if they are born as humans. ||162||

Four hundred and fifty Joanas (a unit of time) are the lifespan of a human being. He who lives for that long, the gods do not come to him. ||163||

"These and other Agamic scriptures, even the wise ones know, what kind of action was undertaken by Madan in his arrival? ||164||

And also, due to curiosity to see the divine play, even though much time has passed, the ignorant ones do not know! ||165||

Even you, whose minds are captivated by that divine play, have spent six months, as if it were a moment, in the upper realms! ||166||

Thus ends the chapter. This delusion is not fit for you to do. Even at the end of the kalpa, does the ocean of milk overflow its limits? ||167||

When even those like you do such things, who else in the world will be steadfast in their dharma? ||168||

Considering all this evil conduct, O great ones! Practice good conduct, the fire that burns the cage of karma. ||169||

Having heard the words of Girvan (the name of the Jain scriptures), the noble one was awakened. That sage condemned his own evil conduct again and again. ||170||

Again and again, the god Aryashada said to him, "Well done, well done, my son! I am enlightened by your great wisdom! ||171||

I, through my own actions, was destined for the path of hell, but you, my friend in the path of liberation, have led me to the path of liberation. ||172||

I am no longer indebted to you, the giver of dharma, who has made me bold in dharma. What more can I say? ||173||

Saluting the god, the sage went to his own place. He reflected upon his past actions and engaged in intense austerities. ||174||

The god, bowing to the sage, filled with joy, forgave his own offense and returned to the heaven. ||175||

The sage Nashad, as seen before, endured this suffering, but it was not appropriate. That sage endured it, and so it should be endured by all the virtuous ones forever. ||176||

**3. The Example of the Shraavak from Saurashtra in the Commentary on the Shree Samyaktv Shataati**

In the land of Shree Saurashtra, the ornament of all nations, there lived a Shraavak, a knower of the truth, from the knowledge of right faith. ||1||

When a famine, difficult to obtain food,

## The Scattering of Eager Rejection

The hungry one, accepting those words, went along the path of the one carrying the vessel, eating and becoming filled with the essence of that state. ||4||

This one, however, who held great joy in the teachings of the Buddha, while traveling on the path, developed a most incurable disease in his body. ||5||

Unable to travel with the caravan, he remained on the path. The Buddhists, covering him with a garment of red ochre, departed. ||6||

He, corrupted in his right understanding, due to the disease, went to the state of the five senses. He became a Yaksha, with knowledge of the limits of life, but with a mind obscured by karma. ||7||

What good deeds, what wonders did he do in his previous life, by which he attained this radiant position of a Yaksha? ||8||

Seeing his body covered in red cloth, the one with external vision reflected in his heart thus: ||9||

"By the influence of the monks, I have obtained divine fortune. Therefore, I too have attained greatness in their teachings." ||10||

"Where I, the resident of the banyan tree, am, the monks eat in the monastery. There, I, with my hands adorned with bangles, bracelets, and rings, revealed myself to the Shakyas, giving them sweets and other things. I treated the entire world with respect in the Buddhist teachings." ||11||

**Couplet:**

Those with deceitful minds, intoxicated by the influence of pride, slander the teachings of the Jinas, though they should not. ||13||

Why bother with other philosophies? Embrace the teachings of the Shakyas, where even the gods are always eager to serve. ||14||

Once, some great teachers, masters of knowledge, wandered the earth. They came to the city of Ujjain, full of strength. ||15||

Those radiant ones, through their offerings, informed the Buddhists of the story. They sent two great sages, saying, "Go and teach them." ||16||

When the hand of a god goes out to the monastery of the Buddhists, it should be held and this should be said to the young ones by the elders: ||17||

"Oh, awaken, awaken! Do not be deluded, O best of the hidden! Remember the five prostrations, the path of auspicious conduct." ||18||

Invited by the Buddhists, filled with pride, the two sages entered the monastery. They touched the hand that had come out and it disappeared. ||19||

Holding the hand, they clearly spoke the words of their teacher. At that moment, the Yaksha, hearing this, awakened. ||20||

He thought, "Alas, how shameful! In my own teachings of the Jinas, even though I am knowledgeable, how can I be deluded, attached to the view of the earth?" ||21||

Then, the Yaksha appeared and addressed the Buddhists, his followers, and others, saying loudly, "Listen to my words!" ||22||

"All other philosophies are declared to be false. Only one truth should be known: the teachings of Shri Jinendra. ||23||

"Therefore, abandoning your false views, embrace the teachings of the Jinas. Just as the tip of the finger touches both the sword and liberation, so too..." ||24||

Having said this, he went and bowed to the great teachers, acknowledging his transgression. Reflecting on his sin, he embraced the Jain path and departed. ||25||

Some, like bees drinking nectar, drank in those words, and in the garden of the glorious Jain teachings, they learned the qualities of the worthy ones. ||26||

Hearing the story of the merchant from Saurashtra,

**4. The story of Kulavalaka Muni, as described in the commentary of Shrimad Bhava Vijay on the Uttara Adhyayana, is as follows:**

A disciple of a sage was very rude and hot-tempered. He was being taught by the sage, but he became angry and entered the abode of anger. 

The sage, with his skillful teaching, tried to teach him, but the disciple considered even that teaching to be like poison mixed with arrows. 

Good teaching for the wicked does not lead to benefit, just as drinking milk for the weak does not benefit but only increases the poison. 

After bowing to the Siddha Shala and the teachers who are superior to the Jinas, the wicked disciple, standing behind, rubbed his foot on the Gandha Shala. 

Seeing him approaching with a loud voice, the wise sage quickly spread his feet, and the disciple passed between them. 

The sage, with his body intact, was angry at the disciple's evil deed. He cursed him, saying, "Oh, sinner! Your wife will soon fall from her body."

The disciple, being small and with a small mind, was unable to bear the sage's words. He went to a desolate forest and stayed on the bank of a river. 

He performed severe austerities there to alleviate his suffering. He stopped eating, drinking, and traveling for months and fortnights. 

After many years, the river, filled with water brought by the clouds, became full of water. 

The Muni, who was like a lotus growing in the mud, was surrounded by the water. The wicked river, like a thief in the forest, was trying to take him away. 

Thinking this, the river goddess flowed away from him. People called him Kulavalaka, meaning "one who is restrained."

**(Pair)**

In the city of Rajagriha, there was a king named Shrenika. He had two queens, Nandana and Chillanana, who were both beautiful. 

The first queen gave birth to a son named Abhaya, and the other queen gave birth to a son named Sunandana. They were both handsome and lived in the palace of Kunika Hall. 

They had ten brothers, all from different mothers. Abhaya, the eldest, took initiation from the Jina. 

When Nandana became a nun, she gave her sons, Hall and Hall, two earrings, a pair of divine clothes, and a pair of saffron clothes. 

Thinking that the eldest son would inherit the kingdom, the king gave his two sons, Gandhadvipa, a watering pot, and a necklace adorned by the gods. 

Kunika and his brothers, being wicked, imprisoned the king and divided the kingdom among themselves. Kunika became the king. 

Their father gave them the kingdom, the necklace, and other things. Thus, Hall and Hall did not inherit the kingdom. 

Their father died in prison after being poisoned. Kunika, filled with remorse, did not stay in the city. 

He was taken to a new city called Champa and lived there like Vasava, a great king. 

He was adorned with divine necklaces and earrings, and he wore the Gandhadvipa on his body. He was surrounded by his wives in the inner palace. 

Every day, Hall and Hall went to the river to play. Their wives, who were like the fragrance of the ocean, played with them. 

**(Pair)**

Some of the beautiful women placed flowers on their shoulders, some placed them on their heads, and some placed them between their teeth.

## The Scattering of Eager Refusal

Some, like little girls, raised their hands. Some, like elephants, swayed their trunks.  || 24 || "What more need be said?" As they spoke, the noble elephant was pleased. He, knowing the nature of separation, acted accordingly. || 25 || Seeing this, all the people of the city exclaimed, "These two are the only ones who enjoy the fruits of the kingdom, not a single ant." || 26 || Hearing this, Queen Padmavati, the wife of the king who was like an ant, became filled with anger and thought in her mind. || 27 || Without the divine ornaments and the fragrant elephant, the kingdom does not prosper, it is like a meal without salt. || 28 || "I will make my husband understand all this, even by force." Thinking thus, she secretly informed the king. || 29 || The king said, "I have given you your brother's wife. I would be lower than a crow if I were to take it back. Enough of this talk." || 30 || Even though the king had forbidden it, she did not give up her pursuit. For a child's pursuit is strong, even among children. || 31 || The king, overwhelmed by her love, succumbed to her wishes. What is not done by those who are under the influence of others, even if it is wrong? || 32 || As it is said, "Even a descendant of a noble lineage can do wrong when influenced by a woman. Curds are sweet, but look at the churner, what does he get?" || 33 || The king asked his brothers for the ornaments, etc. He was like a madman, throwing away his clothes far away. || 34 || They said, "Father gave us this, we are not worthy to give it back. But we will give it back, O King, if you give us a share of the kingdom." || 35 || The king, stained by attachment, said to them, "Why did you take it from your father without thinking? What is the use of this precious jewel, the fourfold treasure? Jewels are said to be for the king, even by the ignorant." || 36 || "If you don't give it back, I will take it by force." Saying this, they left the palace in a hurry. || 38 || "Let them take it," thought the king. "This is not a good idea. This is like a snake in the clothes, it is not good for us." || 39 || Thinking thus, they took the ornaments, etc., and all their belongings. They left Champā at night and went to the city of Vaiśālī. || 40 || There, they informed their maternal grandfather, the king of the Cetas, of everything that had happened, and they were honored for their actions. || 41 || The king of the ants, having lost both his brothers, was filled with worry. When he learned that they had gone to Vaiśālī, he sent a messenger, a skilled speaker. || 42 || The messenger went to Vaiśālī and bowed to the king of the Cetas. "O King, the king of the ants sends you this message. || 43 || The two princes have come here, taking the elephant and other jewels. They should be sent back immediately, with due respect, and treated equally with me." || 44 || "If they do not come, then a two-legged messenger should be sent immediately. Otherwise, there will be much trouble and sorrow." || 45 || The king of the Cetas said, "Messenger, tell the king of the ants, 'The wealth of his brothers, given

Going to the messenger of Chetak, the messenger told his master. Then, he too, filled with anger, spoke of the journey. ||50||

United with ten Kaladyas, with brothers similar to himself, thirty-three thousand chariots, horses, and elephants, ||51||

Thirty-three crore soldiers, he then moved. Kuniika covered the earth and sky with dust-filled armies. ||52||

(Couplet) Then, united with eighteen kings, wearing crowns, he was equipped with fifty-seven thousand chariots, elephants, and horses. ||53||

Chetak also came with fifty-seven crore soldiers. He formed a war formation with his army on the border of his country. ||54||

(Couplet) Kuniika also arrived there and formed a Tayavyuha formation with his army. He fought fiercely, like time fighting time. ||55||

With a visible army of heroes, with their backs uncovered, and their clothes torn, both armies prepared for a fierce battle. ||56||

The Nishad fought with the Nishad, the charioteer with the charioteer, the Sadi with the Sadi, and the foot soldier with the foot soldier. ||57||

Kali, eager for victory, fought alongside Chetak's army. He then went to Chetak, who was fighting the king. ||58||

Then, every day, he released arrows, holding his bow. Chetak killed him, the guest of death, with a divine arrow. ||59||

Unable to bear the sight of the army of the king of Champa, filled with sorrow, the sun then set, and the battle ceased. ||60||

On the second day, the armies again engaged in battle. Chetak killed Mahakal, the commander of Kuniika's army. ||61||

Thus, after killing many others, in eight days, Asoka Chandra, filled with sorrow, thought, ||62||

"I have killed this king, not knowing his divine power. My ten Kaladyas brothers have met their end in vain. ||63||

Today, I will worship some god and conquer this enemy. If not, I will soon follow them." ||64||

Thinking thus, he meditated on the gods, and on the eighth day, he was visited by Indra and Yama, who were his companions in his previous birth. ||65||

"What do you desire?" they asked. Then, Kuniika said, "If you are pleased, let Chetak be killed now." ||66||

Indra said to Yama, "I will not kill Chetak. I will protect him, due to your devotion." ||67||

"In the battle, give him a chariot with a large stone, a thorny club, and a mace. Yama, you will be the reason for his victory over his enemy." ||68||

"First, when they are thrown at the enemy, the thorny club and the large stone weapon will be deadly." ||69||

"In the second battle, the chariot with the mace will be confusing, without any confusion. It will roam around, destroying the enemy's forces." ||70||

Then, the wicked Kuniika, pleased, went to the king. He stirred up the war formation, like the ocean stirred by the mountain. ||7

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

The king, Chetaka, filled with anger, drew his bow to kill the approaching Tam, and immediately released a divine arrow from his quiver. ||72||  He placed a vajra-kavacha (diamond armor) on the front of the arrow, and a layer of iron on the back. Then, the Asura king, ||73||  seeing the divine arrow with its vajra-kavacha, felt a tremor within. The soldiers of King Chetaka thought their good deeds were coming to an end. ||74||  The truthful Chetaka released a second arrow, also named Chetaka. The second arrow also proved ineffective. ||75||  In the first battle, ninety-six lakh (960,000) men perished. In the second great battle, eighty lakh (800,000) men died. ||76||  Among them, Varuna, a descendant of the Nagas, attained heaven. His friend, Bhadraka, went to hell after experiencing animal birth. ||77||  Thus, every day, in the battle between the two armies, eighteen kings lost their kingdoms and perished. ||78||  A part of Chetaka's army entered the city of Vaishali. Kunika, with his powerful forces, blocked all entrances to the city. ||79||  (Pair) Then, the entire army of Kunika, mounted on chariots, rushed towards the two brothers, Halla and Vihalla, to attack them. ||80||  No one in the army was able to kill or even follow the approaching Gandhastina, who was carrying a gift for the king. ||81||  Following the advice of his ministers, Kunika dug a pit filled with burning coals and covered it with leaves. ||82||  That night, the elephant, realizing the danger, approached the pit. Even though he was hungry, he did not move forward. ||83||  Seeing this, the two princes, Halla and Vihalla, said to the elephant, "Why are you afraid of others? Why don't you move forward?" ||84||  "It is better to be a dog, always loyal to its master, than a treacherous snake, who destroys his master's work. You are like that treacherous snake." ||85||  Thus, addressed by the two princes, Sindhu, the loyal elephant, picked them up with his trunk and placed them on the back of the army. ||86||  He himself then entered the pit, sacrificing himself. What great courage this animal possessed! ||87||  Seeing this, the two princes were filled with remorse. They said, "We are blinded by anger and have done a terrible deed!" ||88||  "For whom have we abandoned our country? Our brother has become our enemy. And in this ocean of misfortune, our grandfather has also been thrown in!" ||89||  "It is right that we killed the elephant. We cannot live. If we live, we will only be disciples of the brave gods, and nothing else." ||90||  (Pair) Then, the queen, Shasana Devi, took them to the presence of the great sage, Virajina. They renounced the world and took the eleven vows, becoming wise and learned. ||91||  Halla became a god, victorious, and Vihalla became invincible, having attained the highest state of meditation. ||92||  Even though the two princes had taken the vows, Kunika was unable to capture the city. The moon of sorrow, Ashoka Chandra, became fearless and energetic. ||93||  "If I do not conquer this city with my army, led by Khara, then I

## Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

Hearing this, the king, pleased, instructed the prostitute thus: "Bring here, dear one, the Kūlavala, making him your husband." ||97||

She, a follower of Maya, became his wife. She knew a restrained muni, who was staying somewhere there. ||98||

Going to the forest, she bowed to him properly. This deceitful woman spoke with words like nectar. ||99||

"O Lord! I have set out to visit the holy places. By good fortune, I have worshipped the venerable feet, which are superior to all holy places, here. ||100||

Accept alms from me, who am on a pilgrimage. " Thus, she spoke respectfully. The virtuous muni also went with her. ||101||

She gave him food mixed with poison. She also gave him sweet cakes. From eating those, she suffered unbearable diarrhoea. ||102||

Then, she stayed there, pretending to be ill. With crooked intentions, she repeatedly approached the muni like a serpent. ||103||

She repeatedly touched his body with her hands, under the pretext of tending to him. She gradually made him weak by giving him different medicines. ||104||

With her glances, words, and touch, she tried to confuse the muni's mind. But his mind, unshaken, remained firm. Where is the possibility of a man of steadfast mind being entangled with a woman? ||105||

He then abandoned his vows and became attached to her. He could not stay even for a moment without her. ||106||

Under her influence, he went to Kūlavala, the border of the kingdom. The Kūlavala, honouring him, spoke to the muni thus: ||107||

"Great soul! This city is being besieged by many enemies. Please tell us how to overcome this siege, O destroyer of enemies!" ||108||

Then, disguised as an astrologer, he entered Vaiśālī. He saw a stupa built by Śrīsuvrata, and he was confused. ||109||

"Surely, this stupa has a strong foundation. This city is prosperous due to its glory. ||110||

How can I destroy it?" Thinking thus, he was approached by a worried citizen. ||111||

"Tell me, astrologer, when will this siege of Vaiśālī end? We are very distressed, as if we are in prison." ||112||

He, pleased, replied, "Like a pig in a mud puddle, as long as this stupa remains here, why should you worry? ||113||

People, if you quickly destroy this stupa, then the siege of the city will surely end right now." ||114||

The foolish people, deceived by the rogue, started to destroy the stupa. Who is not deceived by a cheat? ||115||

When they started to destroy the stupa, the king of Magadha arrived. He immediately drove away the king of Campā, two yojanas away. ||116||

Then, the people, convinced that the stupa was destroyed from its roots, the Kūlavala, with a strong army, attacked the city. ||117||

Then, the Cetaka, remembering the five great vows, fasted and tied an iron chain around his neck and fell into a well. ||118||

Then, the king, seeing his steadfastness, came there. He took the righteous man and brought him to his palace. ||119||

He performed proper worship and offered him food. The Cetaka, staying there, attained liberation and went to heaven.

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal
To protect all his maternal grandfather's people, who were being looted, he quickly uprooted them with his knowledge and brought them to the Neelavati mountain. ||122||
Filled with anger, the Kūṇika then, with his well-trained elephants, encircled that city, and after covering it with ploughs, he returned to his own city, having fulfilled his vow. ||123||
Kūlavalaka, a cunning man, died and went to hell. But he was rescued from there and will wander in the endless cycle of existence. ||124||
Just as Kūlavalaka, the Muni, experienced suffering, so too will an unrefined Muni.
To avoid such arrogance, one should follow the humility of the true Guru, as taught by the good disciples. ||125||
## 4. The Story of Gosala in the Trishatishalaka Purushacharita, in the Meditation on Anger
Having said this, the Lord then went to Shravasti, dwelling there. In that city, in the garden called Kosthaka, ||1||
There, the one who had been struck by the brilliance of the Lord's radiance, and who had knowledge of the eight auspicious signs, and who was aware of the minds of all beings, ||2||
Gosala, the potter of the Halahala pot, who was also known as Ajina, proclaimed himself to be a Jina. ||3||
(Pair) Hearing of his fame, people with deluded minds, went to him again and again, and constantly worshipped him. ||4||
At that time, Gautama, with the permission of his Master, entered the city, desiring to perform the sixth fast. ||5||
Hearing that Gosala was there, the all-knowing Arhat, Gautama, filled with sorrow, went to the presence of the Lord. ||6||
Having performed the fast properly, Gautama, at the appropriate time, asked the Lord, in the presence of the people of the city, with a pure mind. ||7||
"Lord, in this city, all the people say that Gosala is the all-knowing one. Is this true or not?" ||8||
Then the Blessed One said, "This son of Mankhala, Ajina, is another Jina, Gosala is a deceiver. ||9||
He was initiated by me, and I taught him. He has embraced falsehood. He is not the all-knowing one, Gautama!" ||10||
Hearing the words of the Master, the people of the city, from that time onwards, spoke to each other in the four directions and in the three worlds. ||11||
"Oh, the Arhat has come! The valiant Lord speaks the truth. Gosala, the son of Mankhala, is a deceiver, not the all-knowing one." ||12||
Hearing this from the people, Gosala, like a venomous snake, filled with anger, stood surrounded by his followers. ||13||
At that time, Ananda, the senior monk, a disciple of the Master, entered the city to perform the sixth fast. ||14||
Gosala, sitting in his Halahala house, saw Ananda entering the city. Calling him, with arrogance, he said, ||15||
"Oh Ananda! Your teacher, desiring honour from the people, is trying to belittle me in the assembly. ||16||
He calls me, the son of Mankhala, unworthy and not the all-knowing one. He does not know my power to burn my opponents with the brilliance of my radiance. ||17||
I will reduce him to ashes, along with his followers. I

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples
113

Opportunity, Spread, Dialogue, and Agent were merchants in the city of Kshemila. ||19||
They loaded their carts with goods and set out on their journey. They entered a waterless forest and traveled some distance. ||20||
The five of them, parched and traveling on the desert path, searched for water throughout the vast forest. ||21||
Wandering, Opportunity saw a five-peaked, thorny bush. He showed it to the four friends. ||22||
They all together quickly broke the eastern peak of the bush. They obtained water from it, drank it, and regained their health. ||23||
Then Spread said, "This thorny bush is long. We will surely get something else from it." ||24||
Then Opportunity said, "Digging is not appropriate for this. A serpent will rise from it, for it is the abode of the wealthy." ||25||
Dialogue spoke, and there was disagreement. "A serpent did not rise from the broken eastern peak." ||26||
Opportunity again said, "By chance, there was water here. Agent, by chance, there will be wealth here." ||27||
Having said this, Agent began to dig. Opportunity, saying, "This is not my opinion," went away. ||28||
Bhalana said, "Opportunity has gone. If he goes, we will dig without him." They all dug. ||29||
From that thorny bush, they immediately obtained wealth. They divided it, and the four took their share. ||30||
They tasted the fourth peak and obtained gold. Then, out of greed for gold, they dug for silver. ||31||
Thinking that there would be jewels in the fifth peak, they tasted it, blinded by greed. Greed increases from gain. ||32||
From the very deep pit, like a fierce poison, a venomous serpent rose. ||33||
That serpent, standing on the top of an anthill, looked at the sun and then at them. He turned the four, along with Opportunity and the bull, into ashes. ||34||
Opportunity, free from greed, and the bull, were saved. The serpent's goddess protector granted Opportunity the desired place. ||35||
"I will burn your teacher, the serpent, and then the four, just as I have burned them. I will free you, Opportunity," said the serpent. ||36||
Then, with his begging incomplete, Ananda went to the Lord. He was worried, thinking, "What will I ask?" ||37||
"I will turn him into ashes," was what Gosala had said. "Was that a madman's speech? Is he capable of doing that?" ||38||
Then the Lord said, "He is capable of doing that to others, but not to the worthy. A wicked mind can only cause suffering to the worthy." ||39||
"Go and tell Gautama and the others that they should not be afraid of him. They do not drive away those who come here with righteous motivation." ||40||
Going to them, Ananda then told Gosala. Gosala came before his master and said, ||41||
"O Kashyapa! Gosala, the son of Mankhala, says that I am his resident. That is a false statement of yours." ||42||

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Gosaala, your disciple, was of the white caste. He died while meditating on the Dharma and was reborn among the gods. ||43||

In this body, I, the sage Udayana, endured the trials of suffering. Abandoning my own form, ||44||

Then, not recognizing me, you called Gosaala, the son of Mankhala, your disciple. How can you call him your disciple when you are not my teacher? ||45||

My lord, just as a traveler, while walking through mud, a pit, a fortress, or a forest, ||46||

may think himself covered by wool, hemp, cotton, or grass, being of little intelligence, ||47||

so too, you, Gosaala, falsely claim yourself to be different. Why do you speak falsely? He is your equal, not your superior. ||48||

Thus, angered by the words of his lord, Gosaala spoke to the Lord: "Today, you are corrupt, you are lost, you are not a Kashyapa!" ||49||

The disciple of the omniscient, the one who experiences all, the one who is devoted to the path, ||50||

was unable to bear those words. Gosaala spoke to the Lord: "By whom were you initiated, by whom were you taught, O Gosaala? You are he!" ||51||

Then, Gosaala, in anger, released a blazing ray of energy, like a poisonous fire from the eyes, for the experience of all. ||52||

Being consumed by the blazing energy of Gosaala, the one who experiences all, ||53||

the one who was devoted to good meditation, died and became a god in the Sahasrara. ||53||

Gosaala, at that time, proud of his own power of energy, ||54||

was eager to rebuke the Lord again and again. ||54||

His disciple, Sunakshatra, a good star, then rebuked his lord, the one who was criticizing his teacher, ||55||

with great devotion to his teacher, as one who experiences all. ||55||

Gosaala, with his blazing body, released by the energy ray, ||56||

circumambulated the Lord, taking on more vows. ||56||

Then, after reflecting and retracting, forgiving all the sages, ||57||

the sage Sunakshatra died and became a god in the realm of Achyuta. ||57||

(Pair) Jita-Kashi and Gosaala, then, with very harsh words, ||58||

cried out to the world, their Lord, who was full of compassion. ||58||

"You were initiated, you were taught, you were made a scholar by me. You are my own, a slanderer. What is this confusion in your mind?" ||59||

Being told by the Lord, "It is you yourself," Gosaala, greatly angered, ||60||

approached and said something to the Lord, with a blazing ray of energy. ||60||

The Lord, who is not subject to the power of others, like a great wind on a mountain, ||61||

circumambulated the Lord, a devotee, following the path of devotion. ||61||

The Lord's body was scorched by that blazing ray of energy, ||62||

like a forest fire consuming the water of a river, originating from the banks. ||62||

"This is not right, this is a disgrace," she thought in anger. ||63||

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples

You, afflicted by the fever of Tejo-leshya, will surely suffer for seven days. || 67 ||

The body, tormented by Tejo-leshya, cried out and fell to the ground like a withered branch in the wind. || 68 ||

The sages, Gautama and others, angered by the disrespect, spoke to Gosala in these harsh words. || 69 ||

Oh, you who are against the Dharma-acharyas, where is your Tejo-leshya, where is it employed in the Dharma-acharya? || 70 ||

Even though the great sage spoke for a long time and even though he killed, he will be afflicted by his own Tejo-leshya, being protected by his master out of compassion. || 71 ||

You will be afflicted in the future, as you were before, by the Tejo-leshya of Vaishkaayana. If the Lord had not protected you with his own Tejo-leshya, you would have been frozen. || 72 ||

Like a tiger fallen into a pit among the virtuous, he was unable to get out and stood there, filled with anger. || 73 ||

He sighed deeply, his fangs and hair bristling, and struck the earth with his feet, repeatedly saying, "I am killed!" || 74 ||

Leaving the assembly of his master, he went to the market, looked at by people like a thief. || 75 ||

(Pair) Then the master told the sages, "The Tejo-leshya that Gosala has projected to kill us, this is its power." || 76 ||

He has the power to burn the lands of Vatsa, Shakutsam, Magadha, Vanga, Malava, Kosala, Patala, Atava, Vajri, Mala, Malaya, Vadhaka, and Anga, sixteen kingdoms. || 77 ||

Gosala's Tejo-leshya, attained through his intense tapas, is capable of burning these lands. || 78 ||

All twenty of those sages, Gautama and others, being virtuous, do not harbor envy even towards the power of another. || 79 ||

Gosala, being consumed by his own Tejo-leshya, drank wine to alleviate the heat, holding a wine vessel. || 80 ||

Intoxicated, Gosala sang and danced, and repeatedly bowed to the Halaahala with folded hands. || 81 ||

He smeared his body with red ochre, and repeatedly drank the water from the house well, which had been mixed with earth for the sake of the vessel. || 82 ||

He spoke incoherent and contradictory words, and was cared for by his disciples with sorrow, and thus passed the day. || 83 ||

Ayampula, the follower of Gosala, was awake all night, meditating on Dharma. || 84 ||

"Where is the Tridna-gopala situated?" I do not know. I will go and ask Gosala, my omniscient guru. || 85 ||

Having decided thus, he went to the Halaahala house, wearing unadorned ornaments, and saw Gosala there. || 86 ||

Ayampula, filled with shame, quickly turned back. He was seen by the elders, the disciples of Gosala, and the world. || 87 ||

"Ayampula, you were born in the last night. You have a doubt about the location of the Tridna-gopala." || 88 ||

Surprised, he said, "Yes, yes, that is true, O great sages." They spoke further to explain Gosala's actions. || 8

## The Scattering of Eager Refutation

This is the last song, dance, and offering of hands.  Whatever else there is, like drinking, the sound of the mridanga, and melody, etc.  || 11 ||

Go to the twenty-fourth Arhat, Gosala, the embodiment of liberation, and ask him this doubt.  He is your omniscient guru. || 92 ||

Thus spoken to, they went to him.  He turned towards them, and they told him of their arrival and doubt in front of Gosala. || 93 ||

They removed the wine vessels and other things from Gosala.  They seated him on a seat, and then the sage arrived. || 94 ||

Then, sitting in front of him, Gosala said, "What is your doubt about the nature of the Tṛṇagopālikā?" || 95 ||

"Know the Tṛṇagopālikā to be like the root of a bamboo," said the sage, and immediately, filled with joy, he went to his own abode. || 96 ||

Having gained consciousness the other day, and knowing his own end, Gosala, with great affection, called his disciples. || 97 ||

"My dead body should be bathed with fragrant water and ointments.  It should be anointed with fragrant unguents and adorned with excellent clothes. || 98 ||

Then, it should be adorned with divine ornaments.  After that, it should be placed in a thousand-wheeled chariot and taken out. || 99 ||

"This is the twenty-fourth Jinesvara, the Arhat, who is now going to liberation.  This should be proclaimed throughout the world." || 100 ||

They agreed, and on the seventh day, Gosala, having become pure in heart, reflected on his repentance. || 101 ||

"Alas! I, a sinner, have greatly wronged my own virtuous Dharma-guru.  I, a fool, have completely disregarded him in three ways. || 102 ||

"I have deceived the omniscient one, and all beings, with false teachings and by hiding the truth. || 103 ||

"The great sages, the two who were worthy of being my gurus, have been burned by me.  Shame on me, for I have lost the essence of their brilliance by my own burning. || 104 ||

"What have I done in these few days?  I have done something that will bind me to a long stay in hell. || 105 ||

"Not only will I, myself, become a guest in hell, but also, because of my false teachings, the whole world will go astray. || 106 ||

"Let it be so, even if the world goes astray.  Let it go its own way."  Reflecting thus, he called his disciples and said, || 107 ||

"Listen, all of you!  I am not a worthy Kevali.  I am only Gosala, the son of Mankhali, a disciple of the hero. || 108 ||

In Śrāvastī, the disciples of Mahavira swore an oath to free themselves from the cycle of birth and death. They also attracted Gośāla, making proclamations and the like. ||115||

Then, Gośāla's body was cremated. His disciples, with great wealth, performed the rites of the funeral pyre. ||116||

## Chapter 118: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**3.** The king of the Saisya country, victorious over the earth, was deceived by many clever tricks. Thus, the Kulagiri, with many forms, was defeated.

**4.** The king of the Pauma country, who protects the one with all good qualities, became firm in the right dharma, known as the great hero, Vara.

**5.** The son of the Vihnu, adorned with the lion dream, was the first son. The great Pauma was the second son, born from the fourteen dream signs.

**6.** The Vihnu, being without desire, was eager for battle. The great Pauma, though young, was established as the heir apparent.

**7.** Then, in Ujjayini, the great sage, Suvaya Jina, was the king. The one named Suvaya, having come together, was said to be wandering.

**8.** The one named Siri Dhamma, a minister, came to pay homage to him. The wicked minister, named Namui, came with him.

**9.** By him, a dispute was raised in the assembly of the monks. The sage, being silent for a moment, was called upon to give a decision.

**10.** He said, "Why has this one come? Does he know his strength? One who cannot tolerate disrespect to the teacher speaks out."

**11.** "The wicked one considers even the great one incapable, due to the teacher's kindness. He desires to see the destruction of the righteous, due to the opportunity of the rule of law."

**12.** "These sages are steadfast in the truth, like a mountain. If you are so insignificant, then speak to me, and I will be with you."

**13.** The wicked one, being defeated, spoke nothing. The sage, being silent, went with his followers to the Saahu country.

**14.** Thinking deeply about the injustice, he rose in the morning. He went to the Saahu country, taking the weapon to kill them.

**15.** The one with right vision, the divine one, was then present there. He was seen by the people of the world, accompanied by the Pauma.

**16.** Then, the people, filled with devotion, did service to the Saahu. The wicked Namui, ashamed before the divine one, was humbled.

**17.** Thinking about the injustice done to the Saahu, he went to the king, seeking justice. He went to the elephant enclosure and met the great Pauma.

**18.** "This king, whatever he desires, is fulfilled by his intelligence. The minister, being defeated, stands near him."

**19.** Then, the great Pauma, with his peace, conquered all the countries. The minister, named Singhbala, with his strength, attacked the fort.

**20.** He was captured and bound. The great Pauma, being pleased, gave him a boon. "Ask for a boon, son, I will give it to you at the right time," he said.

**21.** "I will make Jala Devi my wife, and I will live in the Jina's religion. She is the most beautiful, and I will make her a Brahma-wife."

**22.** The king, being humbled, first spoke to the beautiful one. Then, he made this agreement with Jala.

**23.** "I will take food only if the Jina does not humble himself first. Otherwise, the Pauma king will be imprisoned, and I will remain here."

**24.** The great Pauma, considering this an insult, was humbled. He went to the city of Sindhunandan

Just as anger flares up in the ears when they are desired, so too, is there any possibility of discernment in the presence of the qualities of the Guru? ||74||
O Upasantas, Muni-Saras! Remember the words of the Jina-Bhasya. Cultivate compassion in your mind, and make it a refuge for the three jewels. ||75||
By speaking in this way, and by all the words of the Sangha, the entire world of gods and demons has attained peace. ||76||
In the presence of the great Pauma, one should not be arrogant, even with one's family. One should be humble, calm, and respectful in one's movements. ||77||
Therefore, the Upasantas, who are devoted to the three jewels, are known for their great virtues. They are pure, having been purified by the light of knowledge, as it is said. ||78||
In the presence of the Aryas, in the Kula-Gana-Sangha, and in the destruction of the world, they are pure, like the vast ocean. ||79||
Having attained Kevala-Jnana, the son of Vinhu became a Siddha in due course. The great Pauma, having attained the state of a Siddha, went to the Siddha-loka. ||80||
4. The story of the Nihnva of Shiva-Bhuta, from the Uttaradhyayanasutra, in the chapter on the meditation of anger.
In the city of Rath-Veer-Pura, there was a forest called Deepaka. In that forest, the Aryas, known as Krishna, were the sun. ||1||
In that city, there was a Kshatriya named Shiva-Bhuta, who was the foremost of the Sattvika. He sought to serve the king, who had a thousand warriors. ||2||
The king thought, "I will test this man's qualities of patience, etc. For a man without qualities would be a burden to his master, and not a source of happiness." ||3||
"I will give him a livelihood only after testing him. For a gift given to a man without qualities is like throwing it into the fire." ||4||
Thinking thus, the king, on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight, at the beginning of the night, gave him a goat and a pitcher of water, and said to him, ||5||
"Go to the cemetery, to the temple of the Mother Goddess, and offer the goat as a sacrifice. Do this duty for us." ||6||
Shiva-Bhuta, being courageous, took the goat and went to the cemetery. He killed the goat and offered it as a sacrifice to the Mother Goddess. ||7||
Being hungry, he began to eat the flesh of the goat right there. He was not afraid of the cemetery or the Mother Goddess. ||8||
Then, to frighten him, the king sent some men there. They went there and shouted "Shiva" and "Bhairava" all around. ||9||
He was disturbed by them, but his mind did not waver. There was no fear in his body, and no hair stood on end. ||10||
The king's men then told the king about his nature. He had eaten the flesh of the goat calmly and had gone to the outskirts of the city. ||11||
The king, having understood his courage, gave him a large livelihood. Shiva-Bhuta then served the king day and night. ||12||
On another occasion, the king ordered all his generals and soldiers, saying, "Go quickly to the city of Mathura." ||13||

## Chapter 122: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

No one, not even the great kings, has spoken of the special nature of his [the king's] path. The king, with his fierce nature, cannot be questioned again. ||16||

All of them, thinking, "Where should we go?", were unable to stay or go, as long as they remained on the path. ||17||

Shiva-bhooti then arrived there and said to them, "Why are you standing here, as if you have stumbled upon an inauspicious omen?" ||18||

When they told him about the situation, he said, "We will take both cities equally." ||19||

They said, "Friend, with the army divided into two parts, we cannot take even one city!" ||20||

"The time will come when it will be even more difficult to conquer even one. After conquering one, conquering the other will be extremely difficult." ||21||

Shiva-bhooti then said, "If that is the case, then, O warriors! Give me the one that is more difficult to conquer immediately." ||22||

They said, "The one that is more difficult to conquer among the two, go to that one." He, having won with the strength of his intellect, went to Mathura. ||23||

He himself fortified the villages and other settlements on the outskirts of that country. He captured all the forts and gradually the city as well. ||24||

Shiva-bhooti, the great intellect, having subdued that kingdom, went to the king of Abhyarna and spoke to him about everything. ||25||

The king, pleased, said, "What do you desire? I will give it to you." After thinking for a while, he said, "O Lord, give me independence!" ||26||

"Just as I am free to play with my friends, let no one stop me from taking whatever I want." ||27||

"So be it," said the king, who was true to his word. He then wandered about the city, engaging in various kinds of play. ||28||

He sometimes enjoyed himself with gamblers, day and night. Sometimes, after drinking liquor, he would revel with the intoxicated. ||29||

Sometimes he would serve beautiful courtesans. Sometimes he would play in the water like an aquatic elephant. ||30||

Sometimes he would wander in the forest, like a Nandana garden, playing with flowers, surrounded by a crowd of rogues. ||31||

Wandering like this, he would return to his palace even at midnight. People who are fearless often transgress boundaries. ||32||

As long as he was not at home, his wife would not eat or sleep, as if she were observing a vow. ||33||

She was always tormented by hunger and sleeplessness. She said to her mother-in-law with a trembling voice, "My son comes home every night at midnight. Until he arrives, I do not eat or sleep." ||34||

"I am always tormented by hunger and sleeplessness because of this. Mother, I am your servant, I will do as you command." ||35||

"My dear daughter-in-law, sleep peacefully. I will stay awake tonight." Having been told this, the daughter-in-law went to sleep. ||37||

His mother stood guarding the door of the house. He arrived and immediately said, "Open the door." ||38||

His mother said, "The door will not be opened now. Go away, the door will not be opened now." ||39||

Then, Shivbhooti, filled with pride, thought: "I have been insulted by my mother today, so I will go somewhere else." ||40|| For, "Even if a person is insulted in his own place, it is better for him to bear it. Just as dust, when kicked up, rises to the head, so too should he bear it." ||41|| Thinking thus, he left his home out of shame and wandered around the city. By fate, he saw an open door and a place of ascetics. ||42|| Entering there, he bowed to the Aryakrishnachaaryas and said, "Initiate me into the order." They initiated him. ||43|| Then, he himself, with his own hands, shaved his head. The gurus gave him the insignia, the Dharma flag, etc. ||44|| Knowing that he had taken the vows, the king came there in the morning and said, "What have you done without asking me?" ||45|| He said, "I have done this, seeking my own freedom." Then, the king bowed to him and went away, saddened by his separation. ||46|| After wandering outside, he returned, and the sun also returned another day. Then, out of affection, the king called Shivbhooti and brought him to his home. ||47|| Even though he was unwilling, the king gave him a cloth of jewels. The Suri, who had come with him, said to Shivbhooti, "Why did you take this cloth of jewels, my son? We do not consider it right to take expensive clothes, etc." ||49|| Even though he was told this by the Suri, he did not give up the cloth due to his delusion. But, he hid it in his clothes and protected it secretly for many days. ||50|| 

The Suris wondered, "What is the reason for his delusion?" When he had gone somewhere, they took the cloth of jewels from him. ||51|| They made pieces of it and gave it to the ascetics for sitting on. Knowing this, Shivbhooti came back. ||52|| He stood there, paying attention, and looked for the flaws in his guru. Another day, the Suris were describing the Jain principles. ||53|| 

There are two types of Jain principles. Some eat with their hands, while others eat with a bowl. ||54|| They are also of two types, according to the Jain saints. Some wear clothes, while others do not wear clothes. ||55|| 

Hearing this, Shivbhooti said, "How are the Jain principles being followed now? They are not being followed by those who are free from attachments and without possessions." ||56|| 

The Suri said, "The Jain principles have been broken in India. They were broken by Shri Veeraswami's grandson, Shri Jambuswami." ||57|| 

He said, "It has been broken for those of weak character, but not for us. We are of great character and can still follow it." ||58|| 

"For those seeking liberation, all possessions must be abandoned, including clothes, bowls, etc. I will abandon these possessions." ||59|| 

The Suris said, "My son, clothes, bowls, etc., are not possessions. They are tools for Dharma, and therefore, they are not considered possessions." ||60|| 

"There is no fault in protecting them for those seeking liberation. It is greed that hinders liberation, not clothes." ||61|| 

"The use of clothes, etc., is not a fault for ascetics, because they are tools for Dharma, just like pure food, etc." ||62

## Aturapatyakhyanaprakirnakam

**65.**  For the protection of beings like Sampati, etc., a face-veil is used. For the examination of creatures that consume food and drink, a vessel is used.

**66.**  For the sake of right faith, knowledge, conduct, and austerity, the virtuous ones accept robes and other requisites.

**67.**  Without robes, a monk would be afflicted by cold, heat, bites, etc., and due to distraction, he would fall from right faith, etc.

**68.**  Thus, the means of Dharma are the support of Dharma.  Therefore, the acceptance of these by the vow-takers is not wrong, as it is well-established.

**69.**  He who, without the means, wishes to save beings, etc., like the Lord, would have a fault even in not accepting them.

**70.**  He would not be a true renunciate, nor would he be a true renunciate again.  And such renunciation does not exist in India today.

**71.**  Even though it is said that Shiva renounced everything, he abandoned the tip of his hair.  He abandoned robes, etc., and became naked, and went out of the city.

**124.**  When Bharata, the Chakravarti, was trying to make his younger brothers accept his rule, they renounced their kingdoms and became monks under Rishabhadeva.  All of them attained Kevala Jnana.  Bahubali, however, thought, "How can I accept his rule or become a monk out of fear?"  He was filled with anger and a battle ensued between the two brothers.  Bharata, skilled in the use of eyes, fists, clubs, and weapons, defeated Bahubali.  Bharata thought, "Is this really the Chakravarti?"  At that moment, the Chakra was given to him by the deity.  Bahubali, seeing Bharata holding the Chakra, thought, "Should I crush him along with the Chakra?  Or should I kill him, who has abandoned the rules of life?  Oh, how difficult are these worldly desires!  Those who are attached do not consider what is right and wrong."  As it is said:

**1.**  He does not see his mother, father, sister, or brother, but sees only the objects of desire, just as a person who is attached to worldly desires sees only them.

**124.**  Thus, Bahubali, filled with dispassion, renounced the world and performed the five-fisted penance.  The deity gave him the power to remove dust, etc.  He took to monkhood.  Seeing this, Bharata, ashamed of his actions, praised Bahubali in many ways and returned to his own place.  Bahubali thought, "How can I, who am in disguise, praise my younger brothers who are Kevalins?"  He remained there, standing in a state of complete surrender.  A year passed.  His body became like a pillar scorched by the cold wind, sun, and rain.  Creepers spread all around him, and blades of grass and thorns grew on him.  Ant-hills formed around his feet, and birds built their nests on his knees.  The Lord's sisters, Brahmi and Sundari, went to the young ones and said, "Brother, come down from the pillar."  They went and told him.  He thought, "How can a liberated soul come down from the pillar?  Ah, I understand!  It is pride."  "Shame on me, you wicked-minded one!

5. Verses from the story of Shri Vishwabhooti, included in the Shri Trishatisalaaka Purushacharitra, about meditation on the self.  He wandered for many births, having been cast out from the Brahma Loka. Births are indeed endless, due to the results of one's own actions. ||1||
From there, in the royal palace, there was a king named Vishwanandi. His wife was Priyangu, and their son was Vishakhanandi. ||2||
Vishakhabhooti was the prince, the younger brother of the king. The prince had a beloved wife named Dhaarini. ||3||
Marichijeeva, due to good deeds accumulated in a previous birth, was born as the son of Vishakhabhooti and Dhaarini, named Vishwabhooti. ||4||
Vishwabhooti, in his youth, enjoyed himself in the forest, in the Pushpakarandaka, like a divine prince in Nandana. ||5||
Vishakhanandi, the king's son, was outside, wanting to play. The maidservants went to gather flowers, and they saw him there. ||6||
Knowing this, Priyangu, out of anger, became enraged and went away. The king, wanting to fulfill her desire, sounded the war drum. ||7||
The valiant Purushasimha, a vassal, said in the assembly, "I will go to conquer him." He spoke deceitfully. ||8||
Hearing this, Vishwabhooti, out of devotion, came from the forest and stopped the king from going. ||9||
He went and saw Purushasimha, who was a king, and he was afraid. He went back to the Pushpakarandaka forest. ||10||
He was told by the gatekeeper that Vishakhanandi was inside. He thought, "I have been tricked by the Pushpakarandaka." ||11||
In anger, he struck a kapittha tree with his fist, and the fruit fell down. He showed the gatekeeper the ground covered with fruit. ||12||
"I will cause the heads of all of you to fall like this. If you do not have devotion to me, then it will be worse and worse for you." ||13||
Saying, "I am deceived by pleasures, wealth, and such things," he went to the feet of Sambhooti Muni and took vows. ||14||
Hearing that he had become an ascetic, the king, with his army, went there. He bowed down, begged forgiveness, and requested him to return to the kingdom. ||15||
Knowing that Vishwabhooti did not want to return, the king went back home. Vishwabhooti then lived elsewhere with his guru. ||16||
With the permission of his guru, he practiced austerities in solitude, becoming thin. He went to the city of Mathura. ||17||
At that time, Vishakhanandi's son, Udvo, came to Mathura. Vishwabhooti, at the end of the month, entered the city for his parana. ||18||
Vishakhanandi, having come out of his camp, saw Vishwabhooti, the prince, and was filled with hatred. ||19||
Vishakhanandi, seeing him immediately, became angry like an enemy. Vishwabhooti, with a single cow, fell down. ||20||
"You who caused the kapittha fruit to fall, where are you now?" he laughed. Vishwabhooti, in anger, took the cow by its horns and swung it around. ||21||
"You have great strength,

## Chapter 126: The Scattering of Eager Refusal

**5. The Story of Parashurama, Included in the **Shree Trishatishalakapurushacharitra** **Under the Cycle of the Great Earth Emperor**

The story of the eighth in the lineage of the Great Earth Emperor, who was a Tirthankara, will be told, as it was created by Arati. 

1. In the land of Bharata, in the great city, there was a king named Bhupala, who protected the Kshatriya vows. 
2. He was defeated in a battle by many enemies who had united, a stronger force. 
3. Defeated by his enemies, his face stained with the dirt of humiliation, he took refuge in the feet of the Muni and embraced the life of a wandering ascetic. 
4. He ended his enjoyment of kingship and, as a result of his penance, became a celestial being in the realm of the great Shukra. 
5. From him, a son was born, named Kuru, after whom the land of Kuru was named. His son was named Hastin, after whom Hastinapur was named. 
6. Hastinapur was the birthplace of the Tirthankara, the Great Earth Emperor. 
7. From him, a great-armed king named Anantavirya ruled there. 
8. In the land of Bharata, in the city of Vasantpur, there was a man named Agni, whose lineage had been cut off. 
9. He left that place and traveled to another land, carrying goods and wandering. He reached the hermitage of a sage. 
10. The sage took Agni as his son and he became known as Jamadagni in the world. 
11. He practiced intense penance, like a fire burning brightly, his brilliance unbearable on the earth. 
12. At that time, the celestial being Vaishvanara, who was known by that name in his previous birth, and Dhanvantari, a devotee of the sages, argued. 
13. One said that the right to food was the only dharma, while the other said that the right to food was determined by the sages. 
14. In this dispute between the sages, they decided to have a test. 
15. They said, "Whoever is the most inferior in the worthy, and whoever is the most superior among the sages, should be tested. By what qualities do they surpass each other?" 
16. At that time, in the city of Mithila, adorned with nine virtues, a noble man named Padmaratha was traveling on the earth. 
17. He was a sage who was about to receive initiation at the end of the Vasu Puja. While traveling to Champapuri, he saw those two celestial beings on the path. 
18. Desiring to test them, the king offered them food and drink. Though thirsty and hungry, they remained steadfast in their resolve, their minds unwavering. 
19. The king, with cruel thorns like a crab, inflicted pain on the soft lotus feet of the two celestial beings. 
20. Blood flowed from their feet, but even in such a difficult journey, they walked as gracefully as a feather. 
21. They did not react to the king's insults, songs, and dances, just as a divine weapon is ineffective against its own lineage. 
22. Appearing before him in the form of the sons of Siddhas, they said, "O great one, you have many years left to live. 
23. Enjoy your pleasures freely. What is the use of penance in youth? Who, even if industrious, would do their work at night and in the morning?

The austerity performed by one with unsteady senses in youth is not austerity indeed. The warrior who is brave in battle with a dreadful weapon is called brave. ||25||
Seeing him steadfast in his resolve, the two sages said, "He is virtuous, he is virtuous." ||26||
They went to test the great ascetic Jamadagni. ||26||
They saw him with his matted hair spread out like a banyan tree, his feet covered with dust, and subdued. ||27||
A pair of cuckoos, having made a nest in the tangle of his matted hair by magic, settled there. ||28||
The cuckoo said to the female cuckoo, "I will go to the Himalayas. You are not attached to anyone else, so you will come with me." ||29||
"I am bound by an oath that I will not go if I am caught in the sin of killing a cow. My dear, I will not go." ||30||
The cuckoo said to the female cuckoo, "If you swear that you will not be caught by this sage, my dear, I will release you. May your journeys be auspicious." ||31||
Hearing these words, the sage Jamadagni became angry and seized both the birds with his two hands. ||32||
Then he said, "While performing difficult austerities, what kind of sin is this in me, like darkness in the midst of the rays of the sun?" ||33||
Then the sage said to the cuckoo, "Do not be angry in vain. You have heard that a childless man has no way, haven't you?" ||34||
Thinking thus, the sage pondered, "My austerity is like a thread in a stream for the sake of my wife and son." ||35||
Seeing him agitated and thinking, "He is bewildered by asceticism," Dhanvantari was born. Who can deny that he was born from the merit of the funeral rites? ||36||
The two celestial beings became invisible then. Jamadagni reached the city of Nemikakoshtaka. ||37||
He went there to get a wife, like Shiva who went to get Gauri. ||38||
The king, rising from his seat, folded his hands and said to him, "Why have you come? What do you want me to do?" ||39||
When the sage said, "I have come for a wife," the king said, "There are a hundred daughters in my palace. Choose whichever you want." ||40||
Going into the palace, he addressed the king's daughters, "Which of you will be my wife?" ||41||
He was matted, gray-haired, emaciated, and a beggar. Hearing this, they said, "Are you not ashamed?" ||42||
Like a furious wind, the sage Jamadagni then took up his bow and arrows and made the daughters hunchbacked. ||43||
Then, in the courtyard, he saw one of the king's daughters, who was playing with a pile of dust, and said to her, "You are Renukā." ||44||
He said to her, "Do you want me?" and showed her the sign of a husband. She extended her hand, indicating her acceptance. ||45||
The sage took her hand and rejoiced like a miser who has found treasure. The king gave her to him along with cows and other things, according to the custom. ||46||
He was jealous, and because of his affection, he desired one less daughter. He prepared to perform austerities, which are a waste for fools. ||47||
Taking her to his hermitage, the

## Chapter 128: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Witnessing the blazing fire, Jamadagni Muni then, like Bhutesha to Parvati, properly married her. ||50|| In due season, he said to her, "I will prepare the offering for you, so that a son, blessed like the head of a Brahmin, may be born." ||51|| He then told the king of Hastinapur, Anantavirya, "My sister has a wife, and for her, a Kshatriya offering should also be prepared." ||52|| He prepared a Brahmin offering for his righteous sister, and a Kshatriya offering for the other. He prepared the offering to obtain a son. ||53|| She thought, "I was a deer in the forest. May my son not be like me," and she ate the Kshatriya offering. ||54|| She received the Brahmin offering, and from her sister's lineage, two sons were born to them. There, Rama was born to Renukā, and Kritavirya was born to her sister. ||55|| Once, a certain Vidhyadhara, suffering from dysentery, came there. His knowledge, like a celestial being, was forgotten due to the dysentery. ||56|| Rama, treating him like his own brother, cured him with medicines. The Vidhyadhara, grateful to Rama, gave him the Parashu Vidya. ||57|| Going to the Madhyeshvara forest, he mastered that knowledge. From then on, Rama became known as Parashurama. ||58|| The other day, Renukā's sister, anxious about her husband, went to Hastinapur. There was no distance between them in love. ||59|| Anantavirya, like Indra to the Rishi wife, Ahalya, enjoyed the pleasures of love with Renukā, who was captivated by his love. ||60|| A son was born to Renukā from Anantavirya, like a son born to a righteous wife of Brihaspati. ||62|| The Muni, along with his son, brought Renukā back. Lustful men generally do not see any fault in women. ||63|| Seeing his mother, like a vine bearing unripe fruit, with her son, Parashurama, filled with anger, cut her with his axe. ||64|| This incident was told to Anantavirya by his sister. It ignited his anger like the wind to a dry tree. ||65|| Then, Anantavirya, the king, filled with rage, went to Jamadagni's hermitage, like a wild elephant. ||66|| He terrified the ascetics, took their cows and other possessions, and slowly circled around, like a lion. ||67|| Hearing this story and knowing the truth, the ascetic, filled with fear, Parashurama, ran towards him, like Yama himself. ||68|| Eager for battle, Jamadagni's son, like a fierce warrior, chopped Anantavirya into pieces, like wood. ||69|| He established his rule with the help of his natural warriors. Kritavirya, a great warrior, was still young. ||70|| He had a queen, Tara, with eyes like stars. They enjoyed their pleasures without any hindrance, like the immortals. ||71|| Even though he was a king, he fulfilled his lifespan. He was born from Tara's womb, having been expelled from the womb of Mahashukra. ||72|| Once, Kritavirya, hearing his father's story from his mother, went to Jamadagni and killed him, like a lion. ||73|| Rama, enraged by the killing of his father, went to Hastin

Jamadagni then entered his kingdom himself. For a kingdom is subject to prowess, not to lineage or order. ||75||
The queen of the king Kritavirya, who had been invaded by Rama, went to the hermitage of the ascetics, like a tigress from a forest ravaged by tigers. ||76||
She secretly deposited her wealth and treasures within the earth-house, like a treasure, and it was guarded by the ascetics from the cruel Parashurama. ||77||
Her son was born, as indicated by fourteen great dreams. He happily acquired the earth and was therefore called Subhūma. ||78||
Wherever there was a Kshatriya, there he shone. He was like the embodiment of the fire of Parashurama's anger. ||79||
Rama once went to that hermitage, and the beast blazed. The Kshatriya power was indicated by the smoke, like a flag that had been burnt. ||80||
"Is there a Kshatriya here?" asked Rama. The ascetics, who had become ascetics, said, "We are Kshatriyas." ||81||
Rama, in his anger, destroyed the earth seven times, making it devoid of Kshatriyas, like a forest fire that consumes the grass and leaves only the bare rocks. ||82||
Rama filled the earth with the teeth of the slain Kshatriyas, like Yama, the god of death, who is full of desires and has a full vessel of prosperity. ||83||
Rama asked, "Why is my death destined? For those who are always hostile to me, death comes from afar." ||84||
"Those who are the teeth of the earth, who are seated on the throne here, will eat you. Therefore, your death is imminent," they said. ||85||
Rama then had a sacrificial hall built, which was well-guarded. He placed the throne on the ground in front of it. ||86||
Then, in the hermitage, Subhūma, who was twenty-eight years old and had a golden complexion, went to the courtyard, like a tree that had grown miraculously. ||87||
The celestial being, Megha-nāda, asked, "My daughter, to whom should she be given? For she is not destined for an ordinary man." ||88||
They advised him to give her to Subhūma, who was the most worthy suitor. After giving her daughter to him, he became his servant. ||89||
Subhūma, like a well-digger who is alone and has no other protector, asked his mother, "Is this world small, or is it even greater?" ||90||
His mother said, "The world is infinite, my son. This hermitage is only a speck in the world, like the foot of a fly." ||91||
"In this world, there is a famous city called Hastinapura. Your father, Kritavirya, was the king there, a great warrior." ||92||
"Rama killed your father and took the kingdom for himself. He made the earth devoid of Kshatriyas. We are here because of fear of him." ||93||
At that time, Subhūma, who was as bright as the sun, went to Hastinapura, filled with anger against his enemy. For the power of a Kshatriya is difficult to control. ||94||
He went to the sacrificial hall, like a lion entering his throne. He, the strong-armed one, devoured those who were the teeth of the earth. ||95||
The Brahmanas, who were the protectors

## Chapter 130: The Scattering of the Eagerly Rejected

The eighth Chakravarti, the radiant one, with his wheel, severed the head of Parashurama, like a lotus being cut. ||100||

Just as Rama made the earth devoid of Kshatriyas seven times, so did this one make it devoid of Brahmanas twenty-one times. ||101||

With his army, filled with the dust of the earth, the hooves of horses, and the blood of the slain, he advanced towards the east, conquering the eastern direction. ||102||

His land, adorned with the severed heads of countless warriors, he, like another lord of the south, attacked the south. ||103||

With the bones and teeth of warriors, like oysters and conch shells, he blocked the ocean and conquered the western direction. ||104||

He, the great king, with his army, whose strength was revealed by the roar of the war drums, entered the northern region to conquer the Mlechchas. ||105||

There, he, like a great fire, consumed the Mlechchas, the earth being drenched with the blood of the slain. ||106||

To Megha-nada, for his conquest of the two mountain ranges, the Vaitalya and the Girishreya, the Chakravarti, the great king, bestowed the position of the king of the Vidyadharas. ||107||

He, with a lifespan of sixty thousand years, wandered in all four directions, conquering the six continents, slaying countless warriors. ||108||

He, with his inner self constantly burning with the fire of the fierce meditation on the non-violent, illuminating the path of the virtuous, attained death due to the course of time and went to the seventh hell, the earth of the wicked. ||109||

He spent five thousand years as a prince, five hundred years as a king, half a lakh years in victory, and five hundred years less than that as a Chakravarti. ||110||

## 5. The Story of the Assembly in the Tri-Sixty-Laka-Purusha

At that time, Sakra was in the assembly of Sudharma, surrounded by eighty thousand celestial beings. ||1||

There were thirty-three assemblies, each with thirty-three members, and four Lokapalas, along with countless scattered beings. ||2||

Each assembly had eighty thousand bodyguards, with strong weapons, ready for battle in all four directions. ||3||

There were seven commanders, each with their own army, along with gods and goddesses, and those who were guilty of various offenses. ||4||

They spent their time with music, entertainment, and amusement, Sakra, the lion king, sitting on his throne, guarding the southern half of the universe. ||5||

Knowing by his knowledge of the future that the Bhagavan was present, he rose, discarding his sandals and upper garment. ||6||

He placed his left knee on the ground, and bowed his head, touching the earth with his right hand. ||7||

Rising, with all his body trembling and his hair standing on end, the lord of Sachi addressed the entire assembly. ||8||

"O, all you inhabitants of Sudharma, the best of the gods! Listen to the wondrous glory of the great Lord Mahavira." ||9||

"He, who possesses the five vows, purified by the three secrets, free from anger, pride, deceit, and greed, without any attachment." ||10||

"He, whose mind is not attached to wealth, land, time, or emotions, whose eyes are fixed on the subtle particles, and whose mind is absorbed in meditation." ||11||

Neither by immortals, nor by demons, nor by Yakshas, nor by Rakshasas, nor by gods, nor by men, nor even by the entire three worlds, can the Arhat be disturbed by meditation. || 12 ||
Hearing these words of Shakra, a god of Shakra's assembly, with a terrible frown formed by his furrowed brow, || 13 ||
with trembling lower lip, with bloodshot eyes, and with a deep attachment to false beliefs, spoke to the assembly. || 14 ||
"This mortal, merely a Shraman, is praised by you, O god! The reason for this is his freedom in speaking truth and falsehood. || 15 ||
Even gods cannot disturb him by meditation, O lord! How can he be held in the heart, or how can he be described? || 16 ||
Whose peaks obstruct the sky, whose roots obstruct the netherworld, || 17 ||
who, with the play of dust, shake Mount Meru, whose splendor is hidden by the vastness of the earth, || 18 ||
who, with a single arm, with the play of a mighty umbrella, lift up the earth along with countless other earths, || 19 ||
for those gods, who are not equal in wealth, who are not equal in strength, who are not equal in desires, who are not equal in accomplishments, what is this mere mortal? || 20 ||
"I will disturb him by meditation," saying this, he struck the earth with his hand and rose from the assembly hall. || 21 ||
The Arhats, with the help of others, perform their austerities without interruption. This foolish Shakra, thinking that he is not aware, disregarded him. || 22 ||
Then, with a violent wind, a storm, and a dense cloud of fire, with a terrible form, with Apsaras fleeing in fear, || 23 ||
with a huge body, with a mass of planets struck by the earth, that wicked one went to where the Supreme Lord was. || 24 ||
|| Pair ||
Seeing the Lord of the world, who is the friend of the world without a cause, who is established without hindrance, his envy increased. || 25 ||
That wicked one, with the dust of the earth, rained dust upon the Lord of the world, who is free from all calamities. || 26 ||
Like the moon by the sun, like the sun by a bad day, he covered the entire body of the Lord of the world with a dust storm. || 27 ||
Even the ears of the listeners were completely filled with dust, so that the Lord became like one without breathing in or out. || 28 ||
Even a single sesame seed did not move from the meditation of the Lord of the world. Does a mountain move even when surrounded by elephants? || 29 ||
Taking that dust, the ants with their diamond-like mouths, produced ants all over the body of the Lord. || 30 ||
They entered his body from all sides, and went out from other sides, piercing with their sharp-pointed mouths, like needles in clothes. || 31 ||
His desires, like those of a hapless person, were frustrated even in these. That wicked one created bites, not ending the suffering of the wicked. || 32 ||
With a single blow from them, the Lord, with his body filled with the juice of milk, became like a king of mountains with waterfalls. || 33 ||
Seeing that the Lord of the world was not disturbed by them, that wicked one created terrible, unstoppable, ghee-like flies with sharp-pointed mouths. || 34 ||

## The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

Fierce, blazing, scorching, like the sparks of a consuming fire, they struck the body of the Lord with cruel, sharp, and barbed weapons. ||37||

Though unperturbed, the Lord, filled with the essence of right resolve, created countless, fierce, and sharp-toothed jackals. ||38||

They roared, gnashing their teeth, tearing the body of the Lord into pieces, scattering fragments of flesh. ||39||

Still unfulfilled, the Lord of Death, in his rage, unleashed terrifying, venomous serpents with sharp fangs. ||40||

These great serpents, like creepers clinging to a mighty tree, encircled the great hero, Mahavir, with their coils. ||41||

They hissed and spat, their fangs tearing and ripping, just as the branches of a tree break and fall. ||42||

With their long, dangling necks, like ropes, the Lord, swift as lightning, struck down countless mice with his diamond-like teeth. ||43||

They gnawed at the Lord's body with their sharp teeth, claws, and hands, and then, in their cruelty, sprinkled salt on the wounds. ||44||

Unfazed by these creatures, the Lord, in his anger, created a mighty elephant with a massive, sharp tusk. ||45||

The elephant charged, its feet shaking the earth, its trunk tearing through the sky. ||46||

With its trunk, the elephant lifted the Lord high into the air, tossing him far away. ||47||

"Let him fall to pieces and be destroyed," thought the wicked one, as he watched the Lord falling through the sky. ||48||

The elephant, with its sharp tusks, repeatedly pierced the falling Lord, and from the impact of the diamond-like tusks, sparks flew from his chest. ||49||

The elephant, unable to do any further harm, turned its attention to the Lord's female companion, as if she were an enemy. ||50||

With its sharp, unbroken tusks, the elephant pierced the Lord's companion, and then, with its own body fluids, drenched her in poison. ||51||

From the dust and dirt on the elephant's feet, the Lord of the Asuras created a terrifying, fierce, and sharp-toothed demon. ||52||

The demon's mouth, filled with flames and wide open, was like a burning pyre. ||53||

Its arms, like the pillars of the gates of Yama, were raised high, and its thighs, like tall palm trees, were strong and sturdy. ||54||

The demon, with a mocking laugh, roared and danced, wielding a sword and a dagger, attacking the Lord. ||55||

Seeing the demon, the Lord, like a lamp with dwindling oil, in his anger, transformed into a fierce tiger. ||56||

The tiger, with its tail sweeping the ground, roared and howled, shaking the heavens with its cries. ||57||

With its diamond-like fangs and sharp claws, the tiger relentlessly attacked the Lord, the protector of the universe. ||58||

Seeing the Lord, like a tree consumed by fire, the Lord of the Asuras, in his wickedness, transformed into the form of King Siddhartha. ||59||

"Why are you undertaking this difficult path, my dear son? Abandon this path of renunciation. Do not disregard our pleas." ||60||

"You have abandoned me, your old father, in my time of need," cried Nandivardhana, and Trisala, his wife, wept repeatedly. ||61||

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

Then, even with their lamentations, the Lord remained unmoved in his mind. The wicked one, having made his abode in the form of a mountain, created a mountain of suffering. ||62||

There, unable to find a grinding stone, the wicked one, with great care, placed a pot on the fire. He placed the Lord's feet on the hearth and placed the pot on them. ||63||

At that time, the fire, ignited by him, blazed fiercely. The fire, like a forest fire at the foot of the mountain of the Lord of the world, blazed. ||64||

Even though the Lord was heated, his glory did not diminish, like that of gold. Then, the wicked one made a terrible, cooked dish. ||65||

The cooked dish, even though it was on the Lord's throat, ears, shoulders, and shanks, hung like a cage of small birds. ||66||

The birds, with their beak and claws, pecked at the Lord's body. Thus, his body became like a cage full of holes. ||67||

When the cooked dish, like a cooked leaf, became useless, it produced a great storm. ||68||

It uprooted great trees in the sky, threw up grass, scattered dust in all directions, and threw up crabs. ||69||

It filled the womb of the sky with ashes, and uprooted trees, and that wind struck the Lord. ||70||

Even with that fierce wind, the wicked one, whose family was stained with sin, did not give up his desire. He created a wind that was like a stain. ||71||

The wicked one, who was able to make the earth tremble, made the Lord, who was like a lump of clay on a wheel, spin. ||72||

The Lord, spinning like a whirlpool in the ocean, did not lose his focus, even in his mind. ||73||

This one, whose mind was like a diamond, was repeatedly insulted in many ways. He did not get angry, thinking, "How can I break the city of my enemies?" ||74||

The wicked one thought, "If his life is taken, his meditation will be destroyed, and not otherwise." He created a wheel of time. ||75||

Then, the wicked one, like Ravana lifting Mount Kailasa, lifted a mountain of a thousand pots. ||76||

Thinking that he had created another pot to seal the earth, he jumped up and threw the wheel of time on the Lord. ||77||

The flames, leaping up, filled all directions with terror. The fire fell on the Lord of the world, like a fire in the ocean. ||78||

The Lord, unable to withstand the blow of the wicked one, sank into the earth. ||79||

Even in this state, the Lord did not grieve, thinking, "We are the cause of the world's suffering, so we must save the world." ||80||

Even though he was struck by the wheel of time, he did not die. What other way is there to save him? ||81||

Thinking, "If the suffering is favorable, then I will be angry," the Lord, sitting in his chariot, stood before the wicked one and spoke. ||82||

The wicked one, who was full of evil thoughts, showed the Lord the morning, even though it was not the time, and the sky was full of birds. ||83||

Thinking that this was a divine illusion, the wicked one, who was full of pride, did not give up his meditation, even though he was attacked. ||84||

The Lord, adorned with a crown, earrings

They spread out, hiding behind the dense folds of their garments, occasionally revealing the disc of their buttocks. ||111|| With a gesture of breaking their limbs, they displayed their full, raised breasts, for a long time captivating the one with beautiful eyes. ||112|| If you are truly free from attachment, why do you not abandon attachment? If you are truly independent of the body, why do you not abandon this chest as well? ||113|| If you are compassionate, then how will you protect us from the cruel weapon, the arrow shot by the wicked? ||114|| If you are indifferent to our desires for love, then some respect is due, but not after death. ||115|| Master! Abandon your harshness and fulfill our desires. Do not turn away from our pleas, they said for a long time. ||116|| Even with songs, dances, and bodily movements, and with the flattery of celestial women, the world teacher was not disturbed. ||117|| Thus, for twenty nights, the wicked celestial being, Sangamaka, tormented the world teacher, who was in a state of complete surrender. ||118|| In the morning, Sangamaka thought, "Oh, this one, even though he is in a state of complete surrender, does not waver in his meditation, like the ocean that does not waver from its boundaries." ||119|| "What should I do? Should I go to heaven, having broken my promise, or how should I go? I will torment him, staying here for a long time." ||120|| When the sun touched the path, the Lord, with his vision restored for only a moment, moved towards the village called Valuka. ||121|| Sangamaka, the wicked celestial being, created a mountain of sand on the path, resembling a sea of sand. ||122|| "Maternal uncle! Maternal uncle!" the bandits shouted loudly to the Lord, shaking the earth as if a mountain had split. ||123|| The Lord of peace, the ocean of nectar, went to the village of Valuka, his feet sinking into the sand up to his knees. ||124|| The wicked celestial being, with his cruel nature, followed the Lord, relentlessly, in the city, the village, the forest, and everywhere else. ||125|| Six months passed, created by the tormentor, Sangamaka. Then the Lord went to Gokula, where there was a festival at that time. ||126|| The Lord, having fasted for six months, wished to break his fast and entered Gokula to beg for alms. ||127|| Wherever the Lord went, to every house, the wicked celestial being, with his evil mind, created obstacles. ||128|| Knowing that the wicked celestial being had been subdued, the Lord, having finished his begging, stood outside, like a statue. ||129|| The celestial being, wondering, "What is this broken outcome?" looked at the Lord, but saw him undisturbed. ||130|| The celestial being thought, "For six months, I have continuously tormented him, but he has not been shaken, like the ocean that is not shaken by the waves." ||131|| "Even with this long time, he will not waver from his meditation. My effort here has been in vain, like an elephant trying to break a mountain." ||132|| "Having abandoned the pleasures of heaven, like the earth that has been cursed, how long, alas, will I wander, deceived by my own foolishness?" ||133|| Thinking thus, the celestial being bowed to the world teacher, folded his hands, lowered his head, and spoke humbly. ||134

## Chapter 136

**The Scattering of the Eager Refusal**

"You are true to your word, but I, alas, am false. I have not done what is right. Forgive me, O Ocean of Forgiveness!" (136)

"I will go to heaven, content, turning my back on misfortune. Go you too, without fear, to the villages and cities." (137)

"Go to the villages to beg, and eat unpolluted food. Even the faults of begging were ordained by me in the past." (138)

"The Lord said, 'Do not worry, O Sangamaka! We are not subject to anyone, but wander freely according to our own will.'" (139)

Prostrating himself before the glorious Vira, the fallen god, filled with remorse, set out for the city of Puruhuta. (140)

From that time on, the gods who dwell in Sudharma, for so long, were without joy, without enthusiasm, and filled with anxiety. (141)

Indra, too, was deeply distressed, his mind devoid of all pleasure. He thought to himself: (142)

"I am the cause of all these misfortunes. When I praised the Lord, this god became angry." (143)

Meanwhile, Sangamaka, the fallen god, stained with the mud of sin, his radiance lost, like a mirror touched by water, (144)

false to his word, with dull eyes and muddy lotus-like eyes, went to the assembly of the gods, presided over by the king of the gods. (145)

Seeing Sangamaka, Indra immediately turned his back and said, "O gods, all of you, listen to my words! (146)

This is Sangamaka, the fallen god, a wretch, a sinner. Even though he is visible, he is not fit to be seen. (147)

He has offended us greatly, for he has disobeyed our Lord. Why should we be afraid of him? Why should we be afraid of this fallen god? (148)

The Arhats do not suffer because of the help of others. They suffer because of their own karma. I have taught this fallen god about karma and its consequences. (149)

Therefore, he must be banished from this world, for he is a source of sin for us. He must be banished from this world, this fallen god." (150)

Saying this, Vajrapani, with his vajra, struck the fallen god with his left foot, filled with anger. (151)

He was pursued by the various armies of the gods, dragged by the goddesses of heaven with their strong hands, (152)

mocked by the celestial beings, riding in his chariot called Yana, he went to the peak of Mount Meru, the abode of the gods, where the air is pure and the sky is clear. (153)

The wives of Sangamaka said to Indra, "If it is your command, we will follow our lord." (154)

The wives of Sangamaka, with tearful eyes, wished to follow him. But Vasava prevented them, and all his retinue. (155)

He did, his sister-in-law was making a noise, he thought to himself, "I wonder what her mind is like?" After that, he looked at her closely, and at the time of the auspicious entry, he repeatedly chanted many religious verses, and then, as if he had heard a good thing, his sister-in-law said, "What's the point of all this?" He thought, "This one is definitely a sinner, and she is also being supported by the Blessed One, so I will definitely be ruined." He got up from the couch and left, she thought, "What is this?" After that, he said, "Bring me something from home." She thought, "Is he making things difficult for me?" She didn't see anything, so she went to the ground and brought a small piece of cloth, she went out with her hair loose, Dhanasri said, "Why is your hair loose?" She said, crying, "We are not going home, and the house is also locked." He said, "Don't worry, I will take care of you." His wife said, "What is this?" He said, "Stop this evil behavior." She said, "How do you know?" He said, "I know from your own actions, and I have heard the Dharma teachings, and you are preventing them." She said, "Oh, you are wise, and you have a good understanding of the Dharma, and you have a good understanding of the Dharma. I have spoken many bad things to the Blessed One in your presence, and I have also tried to stop you. Is this the only way to be a sinner?" Then he was ashamed, he was very sorry for his bad deeds, and he thought, "This one is my enemy, and she is also a sinner, and she is also a sinner." Then she said, "What's the point of all this? You will be punished." The rest of the story is the same, until he thought, "This one is my enemy." But in this case, the sin of not giving food to her was very strongly bound to her karma. After that, his aversion to her increased, and he went to the mountain with his wife. He protected his vow, and they both went to the heaven of the gods. There, he protected his vow, and he was born as the son of Asogadatta, the king of the city of Sagara, in the country of Naya, in the family of Samuddadatta and Sayaradatta.

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

After the festival, while the festival-goers were wandering around, a certain woman went to the market. Her former husband's relatives, the wealthy ones, did not welcome her. In the meantime, a second karma, a binding karma, arose. She entered the begging bowl, having taken a vow.  She went to a beautiful house and asked for alms. The woman woke up and, taking off her necklace, she went to beg. In the meantime, a peacock, whose mind was filled with evil karma, swallowed the necklace. She thought, "This is amazing!" Then she was bitten by a snake. She went out, having received alms. She looked around and saw that the necklace was gone. She thought, "What should I do?" She asked the owner of the house. He said, "No one else has entered here today and taken anything." She was very upset and then fainted. 

Even the festival-goers stopped. She said, "The results of karma are strange!" Then she went to her relatives. They did not welcome her, because they were jealous of her wealth. The wealthy ones laughed at her, but they did not change their minds. She also experienced the results of her karma. In the meantime, she stayed in the house with her former husband.  The necklace, which had been swallowed by the peacock, was expelled from its body. They were filled with awe. "Oh, the greatness of the Lord! This is not possible!" They were amazed. In the meantime, the Lord appeared. The gods praised him. They asked him questions. He told them the story of her past life. These festival-goers, they are like this, full of delusion and suffering. 

## 7. The Story of the Two Friends in the *Sri Avashyak Niyukti Hari Bhadriya Vritta* on the Subject of Greed and Delusion. - *Cheda Ganihana* - 

Two friends, they wanted to see a place of execution. They were greedy for gold. One of them took a gold coin and hid it. The next day, he wanted the gold coin. The cunning one said, "Oh, you foolish one, why do we need that gold coin?" He did not agree. His heart did not see it. He made a promise to him. He took two dogs and put food on top of them. The dogs ate the promise. 

He prepared food and brought it to the door. He did not give it to him. He said, "The dogs have eaten it. Come here." He placed it in a place where it could be eaten. The dogs ate it. They barked and ran away. He said, "These are your sons." He said, "How can dogs be my sons?" He said, "Just as the gold coin is gone, so too are your sons."

## 7. The Example of the Lion and the Kesari in the *Sri Upadesha Prasada* on the Subject of Greed and Delusion.

In Champa, there was a virtuous man named Suvrata. He took a vow of fasting for a month. He took four types of possessions, including money, land, time, and possessions. He went out to beg for the first time in his life. Because he was endowed with excellent austerities, all times were suitable for begging. As it is said, "For a monk who eats every day, one time is suitable for begging." This is the meaning of the *Samachari Sutra*. A virtuous person who eats only once a day is allowed to go out to beg once a day, to enter a householder's house for alms, but not a second time. If, after eating once, he is unable to perform the duties of a teacher, a mentor, or a sick

It is said that renunciation of austerity is more serious than eating. Or, if the hair on the body, the buttocks, the thighs, etc., has not yet grown, then there is no fault in eating twice, even for a very young child. A solitary observer has to be sustained by one mealtime, so he begs a second time. A sixth-meal observer has two mealtimes. An eighth-meal observer, a four- or five-fasting observer, and all others have all mealtimes, so they beg whenever they wish, but they should not hold on to what they have received in the morning, because there is a possibility of faults such as attachment to life, etc., arising from hoarding. (This is shown) by the following example.

Once, a monk was wandering through a city in search of food. He saw a merchant selling Singhkeshar modaks (a type of sweet) and thought, "Today, I will take only modaks, and those too, only Singhkeshar modaks." He made this resolution and entered into begging. Due to his greed, he refused everything else. He did not get them, and with a troubled mind, he kept wandering, thinking only of the Singhkeshar modaks. Midday arrived. Then, he became disheartened, thinking, "I did not get the modaks." He entered his house and said, "Singhkeshar modaks" at the place of receiving alms. He wandered like this the whole day, and at night, he wandered in the same way through the market streets, crossroads, etc. He did not even remember the time for performing the daily rituals of writing, reading, and reciting the scriptures. He did not even remember that he should look out for animals on the road while walking, as the sun's rays were falling on the people. Wandering like this, he spent two nights. Then, he entered a householder's house. He said, "Singhkeshar modaks" at the place of receiving alms. The householder, after rising and performing the necessary rituals, thought, "How is it that the monk has come at such an inappropriate time? This virtuous man is a renunciant, and I saw him today, without any attachment. Earlier, he renounced his house, filled with wealth, grain, gold, women, servants, and slaves, and became a renunciant. I know all this. This is the meaning of the song. But why has he come here suddenly at night? If I tell him about his existing faults directly, then what will be the merit of my offering? It is not proper for me to speak in front of a person who knows many scriptures and their meanings. Or, the character of great men is incomprehensible and beyond the reach of those who are attached to worldly things like us. Therefore, only those who are knowledgeable know the true meaning of his thoughts. By observing his actions, which are beyond the scope of ordinary worldly affairs, one should not find fault with the virtues of the virtuous. Nevertheless, it is necessary to test him with the intention of understanding his virtues. Why is he biased? Or, is it just a little bit?" He thought again, "I do not see any worldly desires in his actions. I do not see any desire to steal other people's wealth or gold. He speaks with his mouth covered by his clothes. He is seen to be careful in placing his feet. Therefore, he is not a destroyer of his fundamental virtues. He is known to be desirous of food." Thinking this, he offered him various kinds of sweets, sugar, khar-khajj, ghee-filled moti-chura, kur-kur, camphor-scented sukh-adya, etc. The monk repeatedly said, "This is not mine, this is not mine." Hearing this, the householder thought

## The Scattering of Eager Refusal

The mind of the disciple was calmed. Then the householder thought, "There are four breaks for the monks, as follows: 1. Food taken at night should be eaten at night. 2. Food taken at night should be eaten during the day. 3. Food taken during the day should be eaten at night. 4. Food taken during the day should be eaten during the day. Of these breaks, the last one is permissible, the other three are not. Sometimes, due to greed, one might eat, and then there will be a loss of merit. Gradually, there will be a destruction of the root merit as well. Thus, there will be great loss. Nighttime food is contaminated with endless faults. Even though this is the meaning of the scripture, it does not occur to his mind now. Now, I will do such a thing that will bring great merit by determining the time."

Thinking thus, and with proper humility, he said, "Master! Today, I am very fortunate that you, the moving Kalpa tree, the teacher, have come to my house after receiving the two-fold teachings. Before, all the humans, like the lotus, etc., have seen your virtuous form. You are blessed, content, and your conduct is like nectar. Your feet are worthy of worship. I am deluded, attached to the pleasures of the senses, and attached to my son and wife. I am unable to describe your good qualities in a single breath. Even though I am like this, you have shown great kindness by staying here. Now, please answer one question. Every morning, when I see two or three stars in the sky, I refuse to do the salutations, etc. Today, I refused before the sunrise. Is it complete or not?"

Then the monk, using the knowledge of Shrutadatta, observed the constellation. He saw that two yamas had passed, and it was midnight. He said, "In the twenty-sixth chapter of the Uttaraadhyayana, it is said:

* **"First, one should be attentive, then one should meditate. Then, one should be free from sleep. In the fourth part, one should be attentive again."**

* **"One should not go to sleep at night, when the constellation is in the fourth part. One should stop and be attentive during the evening time."**

* **"When the night ends, when the constellation sets in the day, in the field, in the constellation, it becomes night. That constellation is usually the fourteenth from the sun's constellation, say the elders. When the constellation reaches the fourth part of the sky, one should stop and return from one's studies, at the time of the evening, at the beginning of the night."**

Knowing this, I am deluded. I have acted improperly. Alas, the life of one who is overcome by greed! Oh, disciple! You are knowledgeable in the Jain teachings! You are blessed, you have done good deeds. You have saved me from drowning in the world by asking me about the refusal before the sunrise. Your advice is true. You are my spiritual guide, because you have shown me the right path. Your intelligence and patience are beyond words."

Thus, he criticized himself and praised the monk. Knowing that it was night, he would be committing a sin if he left. Then, he asked for the way to his house, and he stayed there in solitude, meditating. In the morning, to fulfill his vow of not eating before sunrise, he went to a clean, flat ground, and he began to crush the sweetmeats according to the rules. He thought, "Just as the fire of the parrot's meditation burns the fuel of karma, so too, I will burn all the karmas in a moment and become a knower

Chapter:-2 Collection of Examples
143
A beggar approached a virtuous man, and said to the virtuous man who was without a family, "This house will be yours, son, by the will of the teacher." After that, the teacher, being hidden by the Chandala, was beaten by them. To take him away, they cut off his finger. Then, he was taken away by the king's soldiers, and his son was born. When he grew up, another merchant ship arrived there. Seeing him, he asked him, "Whose is this?" He was told, "He is an orphan who came here." "Then, I will give him a gift and make him a householder." He was prepared, and went to the temple outside the city of Rajagriha and slept there. The merchant ship's sailors, named Visa, saw him in the courtyard of the temple. They told the king, "This orphan, who has not yet been initiated, should be given a gift, a garland, earrings, and a gift of money." He entered the city, and was married to Visa. The merchant ship arrived, and the courtyard of the house was decorated. The merchant ship's son was killed by a merchant ship's arrow. The king, the king's minister, and the householder were all killed. The enjoyment of wealth was lost. 8. The example of Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya philosophy, as described in the Sri Mahavira Charitra, in the chapter on the contemplation of anger.
Another, while preaching the Dharma, had a son named Kavila, who was full of pride. He was also protected by the five great vows, and was endowed with the qualities of peace, restraint of the five senses, purity, freedom from dependence, and fruitfulness. He was a good man. Kavila said to him, "My dear friend, you are always talking about renunciation. You should also practice it. What is the point of all this?" The sage replied, "My dear friend, this good Dharma has been taught to you. But I have understood this good Dharma through the power of the good Dharma, through the strength of the fire of renunciation, through the ability to walk on the difficult path, and through the skillful application of all knowledge. Father, this is the way to cross over. Therefore, renounce this world and embrace the Dharma of the monks without any doubt." Kavila said, "My dear friend, is there any place of refuge for you here?" The sage replied, "My dear friend, there is a place of refuge in the Dharma of the monks. Here, too, there is a place for the mind to go. Thus, he preached the truth without any hesitation. The world is like a vast ocean, full of countless waves." "Is it possible to speak of such a vast and diverse world in this way?" "What is the point of this?" "It is wrong to speak of the Jina's teachings in a way that is not in accordance with the teachings." "By eating food that is not suitable, one gets sick." 178. "Even those who are endowed with the qualities of good speech and good answers, are not free from the cycle of birth and death." 179. "He who speaks the truth, even though he is not free from the cycle of birth and death, is like a lamp that illuminates everything." 180. "What is the point of taking refuge in someone who, being afraid of the cycle of birth and death, speaks of the path of liberation in a way that is not in accordance with the teachings?" 181. "Even the most difficult and painful things do not cause suffering to a being who has taken refuge in the Jina's teachings." "Enough of this discussion." He said, "I will speak further." 2

## The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

That Kavi, overwhelmed by the assembly, as if he were greatly burdened by a heavy load, as if he were being urged to do something by a previous vow, as if he were being greatly pressured by a powerful desire, did not accept the Samana Dharma, even in his mind. Then, thinking with a troubled mind, he thought: "This Jain Dharma does not suit me. I have a need for a job, for traveling to other villages, for bodily adornment, for the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, and for a companion. Therefore, I will reject this." Thinking thus, the Kavi was caught in the net of desire, and he learned some kind of false doctrine, a false understanding of the nature of things. And so, he, adorned with a dyed garment and a garland of flowers, with a staff in his hand, became a wanderer, going from village to village, seeking a lover, or a god, or a master, or a great teacher, or a place where he could kill animals, or a place where he could earn a living, or a place where he could indulge in sensual pleasures. And so, in time, while he was speaking, the Tirthankara, who had protected all beings for eighty-four hundred thousand years, who had never been defeated, who had always walked the path of righteousness, who had spent countless kalpas in the Brahma-loka, who had become a god, heard him.

That Kavi, who was not a true seeker of the highest good, who was attached to false doctrines, who was a follower of the path of desire, who was a seeker of worldly pleasures, who was a follower of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding, who was a seeker of the path of false understanding

9. The story of Madhudeva and Pippalada, as shown in the commentary of Shri Aavashyakaharibhadriya, on the subject of hatred.
There were two wandering nuns named Sulasa and Subhadra. Sulasa was very knowledgeable in many scriptures. Meanwhile, a wandering monk named Yajnavalkya announced, "Whoever defeats me in debate, I will be his disciple." He then offered a bet. Sulasa defeated him, and he became her disciple. Due to their close association, they engaged in improper conduct, and Sulasa became pregnant. When Subhadra found out, she harshly rebuked him. He concealed the truth and, on another day, gave birth to a son at night. Subhadra was unaware of this. The wandering monk abandoned the child under a Pippala tree and left with her in the night. In the morning, Subhadra followed his footsteps and saw the child. The child was hungry and, out of fear, had put a Pippala fruit in his mouth and tasted it. Thus, he was named Pippalada. He grew up, and Subhadra taught him. He became very eloquent. He learned about his parents and developed hatred towards both his mother and father. He embraced the unrighteous Vedas and propagated them. He taught them this: "Kings should perform sacrifices with animals, horses, elephants, humans, etc., for the sake of peace and to attain heaven." He had a friend named Parvata, who was famous for the story of "Aliehi Ya Vasuraaya." Parvata told him, "It is mentioned in the Vedas that sacrifices should be performed with non-living things. You have presented a good argument."
Furthermore, a prince named Madhu was humiliated by all the kings gathered at a marriage pavilion. He developed hatred towards them and died. He was reborn in another realm. He thought, "This is a brilliant plan devised by the son of the wandering monk. If these kings follow this, they will all go to hell. My hatred will be fulfilled." Thinking this, he approached Pippalada and said, "Propagate this in the world. I will help you." He then caused diseases everywhere. The wandering monk told the kings, "If you perform sacrifices with animals, everything will be cured. These animals will be killed in the sacrifice and will go to heaven. There is no fault in this." The kings followed his instructions. To give the impression of going to heaven, they placed the bodies of the animals killed in the sacrifice on a chariot and sent it into the sky. Madhudeva appeared to the people and cured all the diseases. Thus, the people believed in this. Then, Pippalada, while propagating this, took his parents from the king's palace, saying that they would attain liberation. He killed them in the sacrifice, claiming that the sacrifice was the ultimate goal. From that time onwards, the unrighteous Vedas were practiced. This is a summary.
9. The story of hatred, a section from the Dharma Ruchi, a part of the Aakhyanaka Manikosa.
A boat named Nanda, carrying a multitude of people, crossed the Ganges, which was full of living beings and flocks of birds.
1.
A man named Dharma Ruchi, who was wealthy and possessed various virtues, was crossing the Ganges on that boat.
2.
As the boat was about to reach the other side, a storm arose. The boat was tossed about by the strong waves.
3.
A group of six thousand people perished in the storm.
4.
A crow, born from the dead, was a wicked creature. Dharma Ruchi also perished and was reborn as a crow.

## Chapter 146: The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

The monks, having gone out to beg, were eating. There, the householder, remembering his past life, was angry. ||5|| He scattered the food, the monk got up and said something else. He did the same, even in that place. ||6|| Then, the righteous one thought, "What kind of happiness is this I have received?" Seeing the evil, he too became angry. ||7|| Then, on the bank of the Mayang river, a swan died and was reborn. In time, the righteous one went there. ||8|| Seeing him, the swan, with its wings filled with cool water, remembered its past life and was chilled in the cold season. ||9|| Thus, again and again, the monk was tired, but he did not leave until he asked, "What kind of happiness is this, that I have been entangled in this way?" ||10|| A lion, having died, was reborn in the Anjana mountain, and was very fierce. In time, the righteous one went there with his companions. ||11|| Seeing them, the lion, with its companions, quickly ran away, fleeing from the group of monks, until it was stopped by the world. ||12|| "Who is it that has not been bound? What kind of happiness is this I have received?" The monk, quickly becoming angry, spoke harshly. ||13|| Having died, he went to the city of Varanasi, and entered the begging bowl. The righteous one saw him. ||14|| Seeing him, he was delighted, and he did everything to please him. Because of the hatred of his past life, he was killed by him. ||15|| Having died, he was reborn as a king in the same place. He remembered his past life and thought, "I have been a fool in these many lives." ||16|| "Even if I were to be given all the wealth of the kingdom, I would not be happy. If I see him, I will be content." ||17|| "For the sake of knowing this, I will recite the story of my past life with the righteous one! Everyone should read this story." ||18||

"Nanda was a boatman on the Ganges, a householder in the assembly. The swan was on the bank of the Mayang, the lion was on the Anjana mountain. ||1||
The merchant was in Varanasi, the king came there." Whoever completes this story, the earth will give him half the kingdom. The people of the city proclaimed this with great enthusiasm. ||19|| The wise ones, following the path of the wise, followed the western half. The foolish ones did not follow, for they were not human. ||20|| The righteous one, wandering, came to that place and got up. In the garden, the gardener read it. ||21||

"Nanda was a boatman on the Ganges," having heard this, he said, "You read it again and again, why, good sir, is this?" ||22|| The righteous one, seeing his foolishness, told him the true meaning of the monk. Then, the monk completed the western half in this way. ||23||

"This is the one who is wounded, he has come here." ||2|| Taking this complete story, he was comforted and lived in peace. The king, having heard this, was very frightened. ||24||

He fell down in the great circle due to pride, then he went to hell. This is the result of the evil deeds. ||25||
He was beaten, he said, "What should I do? What should I take?" But I have been given the root of suffering by the monks. ||26||
The king of Ujjain, who was known for his generosity, was asked, "Who did this deed?" He said, "The Muni in the forest." ||27||
He went there and met the sage, he bowed down to him and asked for forgiveness. He was forgiven and he accepted the teachings of the monks. ||28||
The Muni, who had attained liberation, was pleased with his previous deeds. He praised him and made him sit at the feet of his guru. ||29||
He was purified by the fire of right knowledge, his mind was clear, his remaining karma was destroyed, he attained happiness and liberation. ||30||
9. In the commentary on the Sri Kalpa Sutra, the story of Virakadeva is mentioned in the context of hatred.
In a certain city, the wife of a certain king, Viraka, named Vanamala, was very beautiful. She was kept in the inner palace. The king was very sad because of her separation. He would see anyone and say, "Vanamala, Vanamala." In this way, he would wander around the city surrounded by many people who were curious. He was seen by the king playing with Vanamala. Then, both of them thought that they had done something wrong. They died instantly due to a lightning strike and were reborn together in the Hari Varsha region. When the king heard that they were dead, he became cautious and said, "Oh, the sin of the sinners is attached to them." Then, he became detached and practiced austerities and became a recluse. He saw them with his divine knowledge and thought, "Oh, these two enemies of mine are enjoying happiness together and will become gods. Therefore, I will make them fall into hell." With his power, he brought them here in a shrunken form. He gave them the kingdom and taught them seven vices. Then, they went to hell. His lineage was Hari Vasa. Here, the bringing of the couple here, the shrinking of their bodies, the teaching of the vices, and the going to hell, all are amazing.
10. In the story of the Pandavas, the story of Balabhadra, who carried Vishnu's body, is mentioned in the context of delusion.
The Muni said, "The knowledge is uninterrupted." Balarama took water and went to Krishna. ||1||
He said to his brother, "Get up, get up, dear one. This water is cool and fragrant." ||2||
He washed his face with it and drank some. The fatigue caused by the journey in the distant wilderness was removed. ||3||
The charioteer said, "Why are you angry, O lord? Are you wasting time?" ||4||
Krishna said, "This is your anger now, but now be happy. The water is scarce in this country." ||5||
The charioteer thought, "He is lying. He is tired and wants to sleep. He is thinking about sleeping." ||6||
Krishna got up and went to Krishna. There were flies around Krishna. He was confused and covered his face. ||7||
Then, he saw the blood of the slain Kansa and the wounds on his feet. ||8||

## Chapter 148: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**Verse 9:** Filled with rage, he roared like a lion, shaking the forest and causing the earth to tremble.

**Verse 10:**  He spoke, intoxicated with anger, "Who is the sinner, tell me, who killed my brother, who was sleeping, his life like a boundless ocean?"

**Verse 11:** "Even in the midst of the sleeping, the intoxicated, the careless, the children, the women, the ascetics, and the cows, who would dare to strike a cruel, wicked soul?"

**Verse 12:** "If there is anyone with strong arms, let him come forward. This is the medicine for all, the arm of those who are burning with fever."

**Verse 13:** And so on, he spoke many words in anger, his voice echoing through the mountains. He released a torrent of abuse, and fainted, falling to the ground.

**Verse 14:**  He regained consciousness in a moment, and, with the cool winds of the desert, he wept, lamenting with cries of sorrow.

**Verse 15:** "Alas! He was the only one who was brave in the world! Alas! He was the only one who was fierce to his enemies! Alas! He was the only one who was steadfast in his virtues! Alas! He was the only one who was loving to his teachers!"

**Verse 16:** "Alas! He was the one who destroyed Kamsa! Alas! He was the one who extinguished the fire of time! Alas! He was the one who destroyed Jarasandha, the one without a lineage! Alas! He was the one who was fierce and valiant in battle!"

**Verse 17:** "Alas! He was the one who played with Lakshmi! Alas! He was the one who was fearless, the crown jewel! Alas! He was the one who was the banner of fame! Alas! He was the one who was the festival of Rama's eyes!"

**Verse 18:** "The wounds inflicted by the weapons of his enemies, those were a burden to him in the past. How can we now bear the thought of death from this wound on his leg?"

**Verse 19:** "Rise quickly, the sun is climbing high in the sky. We cannot travel ahead in the heat of the day."

**Verse 20:** "I cannot move because of the pain in my leg. Get on my shoulder, brother! Are you confused?"

**Verse 21:** "Why do you cry like this? Why don't you answer me? These ears are eager to drink the nectar of your words."

**Verse 22:** "You were angry with me before, but that anger has never gone away. Now, even without a reason, why do you hold this long-lasting anger?"

**Verse 23:** "Alas! Fate! If this was destined to happen, then why did you make this world, this universe, a place of justice and righteousness?"

**Verse 24:** "Or perhaps you know that you are mocking me. But even a small sprout can have great strength."

**Verse 25:** "What is the use of these reproaches? We will face fate together. We will overcome this evil one."

**Verse 26:** "If you are not willing to go because of your love for the comfort of sleep, then stay here, brother, in the shade of this forest."

**Verse 27:**  He spoke these words, sometimes high, sometimes low, and called the day "the bearer of the sun" and the night "the one who brings darkness."

**Verse 28:**  With these words, he urged Achyuta

The charioteer then said, "In battles, thousands are killed. Even if he is dead now, by a blow to his foot. ||34|| If he is a soul, a living being, your relative. Even if he is in pieces, the chariot will be improved. ||35|| Where is my relative dead? Why are you so sad? Seeing him crooked again and again, he did not move the plow forward. ||36|| After examining it, he planted a lotus in a stone. The plowman laughed and said something loudly. ||37|| "What is this, in this extremely hard stone? Will a lotus sprout even with thousands of efforts? ||38|| He also said, "If this is true, my brother will live. In this rough stone, a lotus will sprout. ||39|| Even this, the Indian, was helpless in his ignorance. He moved the pestle forward, clearly laughing. ||40|| Then, seeing the one who was watering the plant that had been burnt by the fire of the forest, Rama said, "Oh, what a bad decision! Do burnt plants ever produce shoots? ||42|| He said, "If the body is a messenger, then this tree will also become a shade. ||43|| Hearing his words, the plowman moved forward. He saw someone throwing grass into the cow's mouth. ||44|| The cows also said, "How can these be good? Will they eat grass, having gone to the state of skeletons? ||45|| He also said, "If he is standing with his feet, he will go. Then the cows will eat these grass shoots. ||46|| Rama then thought, "Is my brother really dead? Everyone is saying the same thing. ||47|| As long as the consciousness is not completely gone, the plow will move a little. Then, a god appeared in front of him, his mind at peace. ||48|| He said to the charioteer, "I am Siddhartha, your charioteer. Due to the power of his penance, he has attained the state of a god. ||49|| Remember, during your wandering, you will ask me. You will save me from falling into the ocean of misery. ||50|| Seeing you now, lost in the sleep of delusion. Remembering your request, I have come to awaken you. ||51|| When death said to Murari's daughter, "You are old." What he said, that happened, his words were not false. ||52|| These stones, chariots, etc., are all transformations. I have shown them to you to remove your brother's delusion. ||53|| Freeing yourself from this delusion, the accumulation of suffering. Create something great within yourself, karma. ||54|| Relatives are found by souls, birth after birth. But they are the cause of your delusion, the army of delusion. ||55|| All souls, alas! Deceived by the love of relatives. They never endure the suffering of karma. ||56|| The love of relatives is a vast ocean, for those who are going to happiness. It is the destroyer of that ocean, the resting place of the line of suffering. ||57|| Hearing the words of Siddhartha Deva, the plowman said, "You are right, brother! I am well-instructed. ||58||

"But tell me, brother, what is the remedy for the grief of Murudvisha, who is deeply afflicted by death? How can he find solace?" (59)

"He is a god, brother, a tree that fulfills the desires of the three worlds. There is indeed Bhagavan Nemi, the reliever of the suffering." (60)

"The rain of nectar from his feet is a shower of blessings. Take initiation and attain eternal happiness and prosperity." (61)

"Thus, the one who carried the bow accepted his words. He, along with Murarata, performed the Agni Karma and other rituals." (62)

"Then, he, with a mind eager for self-control, went to the sage Vidhyadhara, who was holding a plough." (63)

"Approaching him and bowing, the son of Rohini, with a heart filled with joy, asked the sage, "Welcome, sir!" (64)

"The sage replied, "Blessings! The Lord, the fulfiller of all desires, Sriman Nemi, has known your heart and has sent you to me." (65)

"Do what your mind desires, for the sake of your well-being and virtuous wealth. This is the time for you to cut the root of your evil deeds." (66)

"Thus, urged by the sage's enthusiasm, the celestial being, the one who carried the bow, immediately renounced all vices." (67)

"He instantly understood the secrets of the Javas, the Atirasyas, and the Ahyas. He realized that true refinement is not dependent on birth or lineage." (68)

[Sri Pandavacharitra, Slokas 23 to 90] 11. The story of Kapila, who was driven by increasing greed, as described in the Sri Uttaraadhyayana Brihadvrutti.

At that time, in the city of Kosambi, King Jitasattu, a Brahmin named Kasava, proficient in fourteen branches of knowledge, was highly respected by the king. He was wealthy and well-off. His wife's name was Jasa. Their son was named Kavila. Kasava, the father of Kavila, passed away when Kavila was still young. The king gave the boy a gift of a chariot, which he used to travel around. One day, while Kavila was riding in the chariot, his mother, Jasa, was distressed. Kavila asked her, "Mother, why are you so sad?" She replied, "My dear, your father was a learned man. I wish you could be like him." Kavila said, "I want to learn too." Jasa said, "I don't know anyone who can teach you." She then said, "There is a learned Brahmin named Indadatta in the city of Savatthi. He can teach you." Kavila went to Savatthi and met Indadatta. Indadatta asked him, "Who are you?" Kavila told him his story. Indadatta agreed to teach him. There was a young man named Salibhadda who was also studying with Indadatta. He was jealous of Kavila and tried to harm him. He even tried to kill him. Kavila was a cheerful person and remained friendly with Salibhadda. He said to him, "You are my brother. I don't hold any grudge against you. Don't be angry with me. I am going to eat with my friends. You are welcome to join us." Another servant girl was very fond of Salibhadda. She was upset with Kavila and tried to harm him. She was unable to do so

It is said that he was sent away with great disrespect due to his greed. While going, he was caught and bound by the guards. Then he was brought before King Prasenajit. The king questioned him, and he explained his nature. The king said, "If you tell me the way, I will give it to you." He said, "The way is strange." The king then said, "Think about it, O Asogavaniya." He thought, "Will I have a house, a bed, a chariot, a garden, and enjoyment for two months, or will I have ornaments, a house, a bed, a chariot, a garden, and enjoyment for two months?" He did not settle on anything even after thinking about a kodi. Thinking, he became aware of the good fortune and the urge to go. He went to the king's palace, having become self-aware and having renounced the world. He came to the king's treasury, having renounced the world and having become self-aware. The king asked him, "What were you thinking about?" He said, "As much profit, so much greed." The king said, "I will give you a kodi today." The king, who was a hypocrite, said, "I will give you a kodi today." He went away and took a kodi. The monk became close to him. || 1 ||

12. The story of Jamali in the Sri Upadesha Prasada, a discourse on false belief.

There was a city called Kundapura. There lived a prince named Jamali, who was the nephew of Bhagavan Sri Shaleya. His wife was Priyadarshana, the daughter of Sri Vardhamana. Jamali enjoyed pleasures with her. One day, the Lord was wandering and came there. Jamali, seeing him coming, went there, prostrated himself after circumambulating him, and listened to this Dharmadeshana:

"A house, friends, sons, wives,
Grain, wealth, and the profit of my business.
Doing this, the fool does not know,
That he will leave everything and go to the world of animals." || 1 ||

Hearing these words, he went home, and with great respect, he took leave of his father and mother and became an ascetic with five hundred Kshatriyas. Then, Priyadarshana, along with a thousand women, also became an ascetic. Then, after studying for eleven years, he built a vihara for the Jina. The Jina remained silent and did not give any answer. Nevertheless, he left with five hundred monks and went to Sravasti. There, he stayed in the Tindukoda garden at the caitya. There, he suffered from a severe illness due to the food he had eaten. He was unable to sit down. Then, he told the monks, "Make a bed for me quickly, so that I can sit there." They started to do it. Jamali, who was suffering from a severe fever, asked, "Is the bed made?" The monks, seeing that it was almost made, said, "It is made," even though it was only half made. Then, he, with his mind disturbed by pain, got up and saw that the bed was only half made. He became angry. Remembering the principle, "What is being done is done," etc., he thought, "The words of the Lord, 'What is being done is done, what is moving is moving,' etc., are false. Because this is my direct experience, that the bed is being made but is not made. Therefore, everything that is being done is not done. But what is done is called done. What is done, like making a pot, is seen only at the end of the time of action, but it is

## The Scattering of the Eager Refutation

"This is established by the authority of the children," having said this, he spoke his own fabricated opinion to the Sadhus. Then, the elders of his own sect said, "O Acharya! This is not a false statement of the Bhagavan, nor is it against the authority. Because, in a single act like making a pot, there are countless intervening causes and effects. Bringing the clay, kneading, shaping, drying, and the time for the pot to be made, all of this is the time for the pot to be made, according to your opinion. But this is not right. Because, other actions are begun and completed at every moment, as the time for the action and the time for the completion of the action are the same. But the pot is begun and completed only at the end of the time. There is much to be said here, it should be understood from the great commentary. And as you have said, it is also not right because of your half-closed vision, because whatever is spread out in a particular space at a particular time, is spread out there at that time. So, the cloth is spread out only at the time of spreading out the Western cloth. The words of the Bhagavan are free from fault because they are relative to specific time."

Having been unable to understand him with these arguments, the elders left him and went to the revered Viraantika. Priyadarshana was also there at that time, in the house of the Shraddha-Dhanka-Kumbha-maker. She was completely devoted to Jamali's opinion. She was also ready to defend the Dhanka. Then, knowing that the Dhanka was based on falsehood, she was told, "We do not know anything about the Neddasham."

On another occasion, while she was engaged in turning and inverting clay pots in the kitchen, he threw a piece of coal on a part of her cloth, and while she was studying in that very place, her robe was burnt. She said, "Shravaka! You have burnt my robe." He said, "But the Bhagavan's doctrine is that what is burning is burnt, so where and by whom has your robe been burnt?"

Ignoring his words, she became enlightened and said, "I am rightly inspired," and having given a false wrong, she went to Jamali and informed him. When he was not enlightened in any way, she left him alone and went to the Bhagavan.

Once, Jamali went to Champa and said to the revered Vira, "O Jin! Your other disciples are living in disguise, having abandoned me. I have become a born knower, a seer, an Arhat, an omniscient."

Then, Gautama said, "Do not call yourself Jamali. Knowledge never slips, because it is only for the knower."

If you are a Kevali, then give me an answer to my question - is this world eternal or non-eternal? Are these beings eternal or non-eternal?

Hearing this, he was unable to answer and remained silent like a controlled serpent. Then, the Vibhu said, "O Jamali! Those disguised disciples are also able to answer these questions.

"This world is eternal in relation to the past, present, and future. But it is non-eternal in relation to the ascending and descending cycles."

"O Jamali! This being is eternal in its essence, always. But it is not eternal in its transformations as a beast, a human, or a hell-being."

Not believing the words of his master, he continued to argue with himself and others, and with false attachment, he continued to defend his position. In the end, he abandoned the path of liberation, and after considering, he did not repent. He became

12. The story of Govinda-vachana in the commentary on the Upadesha-pada.
This story of Govinda-vachana is found. As it happened, in a certain city, a Suri was insulted by the wicked. ||1|| Govinda, a Shakyabhikshu, was a great orator, a destroyer of the pride of all learned men, and he was striving to uplift the Danavas. ||2|| Pair. || He went to the vihara, accompanied by the Munis, who were well-versed in the scriptures, proficient in the art of debate, and wise in logic. ||3|| Sri-Gupta, a Suri, was a great luminary, a shining star of the great beings. He was a virtuous man, and he stood firm in his place, adorned with great fame. ||4|| As the moon shines brightly in the sky, adorned with the stars, so he shone brightly among his own followers. ||5|| As the fragrance of flowers fills all directions, so the minds of the people were filled with the fragrance of his virtues. ||6|| The people of that city, who were well-versed in the virtues, were filled with joy at the sight of the Suri. They were like thorns in the lotus feet of the Suri. ||7|| They heard the Dharma spoken by the Jinas, which destroys karma. They were filled with joy and meditation, and their minds were filled with the teachings of the Suri. ||8|| A great wave of knowledge spread throughout the city. I do not think there was anyone who was not amazed by the Suri. ||9|| As a person who has removed seven veils becomes proud, so Govinda became proud when he heard the teachings of the Suri. ||10|| Who, in the presence of me, who am an ocean of knowledge, can achieve fame in the dark? ||11|| With pride in his heart, he challenged the Suri to a debate. ||12|| He was defeated by the Suri, who was like a torrent of rain, and his arguments were scattered like dust. ||13|| He realized that he was not equal to the Suri. He thought, "I will not be defeated by him until I have mastered the scriptures." ||14|| He left the city and went to a distant land. He studied the scriptures diligently, and he became confident in his knowledge. ||15|| He was eager to debate with the Suri again. He was determined to defeat him. ||16|| He was not able to defeat the Suri, who was like a great wave, and he was defeated again. ||17|| He went to another city and studied the scriptures again. He was determined to defeat the Suri. ||18|| He challenged the Suri to a debate again, but he was defeated again. ||19|| He went to another city and studied the scriptures again. He was determined to defeat the Suri. ||20|| He studied the scriptures of the plants, and he argued that plants are living beings. ||21||
He said, "This is also a living being, this is also a living being. This is also a sentient being, this is also a sentient being. This is also a mind-possessing being, this is also a mind-possessing being. This is also a being that is cut and joined, this is also a being that is cut and joined. This is also a being that has food, this is also a being that has food. This is also a being that is not a self, this is also a being that is not a self.

Before the Shakyamat-culture, as a living being, he did not believe in trees. He did not believe in the decrease of delusion in any way. ||22|| Like a person born blind, he was attached to sight, unable to see the trees. He clearly expressed his own opinion as a living being. ||23|| 

Even then, the Guru initiated him again. He was born as the head of the age, having attained the knowledge of the speaker. ||24||

13. The story of Shri Jnata Dharma in the Murchaadhyana Agama, the account of Kanakdhvaj.

Thus, O Jambhoo! In that time, in that era, there was a city named Teyalipuram, in the region of Ujjain, ruled by a king. The king's queen was named Paumavati, and the king's minister in Teyalipuram was named Samadanda. In that Teyalipuram, there was a wealthy merchant named Kala, who was very prosperous. His wife's name was Bhadda. Kala, the wealthy merchant, had a daughter named Pottila, who was beautiful, youthful, and fair-skinned, with a perfect body.

Pottila, the daughter, would often go out to enjoy the fresh air, adorned with all ornaments, surrounded by her maids, and would roam about in the sky and on the ground, moving like a lightning bolt. She would pass by the house of Kala, the wealthy merchant, near the place where the minister of Teyalipuram was standing.

As Pottila, the daughter, was roaming about in the sky and on the ground, moving like a lightning bolt, near the house of Kala, the wealthy merchant, she was seen by a young man from a wealthy family. He was struck by her beauty, youth, and fairness, and he called out to her. He said, "O, you who are dear to the gods! What is the name of this daughter?"

The young man from the wealthy family told the minister of Teyalipuram, "Sir, this is Pottila, the daughter of Kala, the wealthy merchant, and the daughter of Bhadda. She is beautiful, youthful, and fair-skinned, and her body is perfect."

The minister of Teyalipuram, who was standing near his chariot, heard this and said, "Go, you who are dear to the gods! Go and ask Kala, the wealthy merchant, for his daughter Pottila to be my wife."

The young man from the wealthy family, having been told this, was very happy. He bowed his head, folded his hands, and said, "Yes, sir!" He then went to the house of Kala, the wealthy merchant.

Kala, the wealthy merchant, saw the young man coming. He got up from his seat, welcomed him with respect, and offered him a seat. He then sat down and spoke to him with a smile.

Thus you say-O Devānupāyā! What is the arrival of the bride? Then they, the men of the inner quarters, say to the maid-servant-We, O Devānupāyā! want to give your daughter in marriage to Teyalipuṭṭa for his wife. Do you know, O Devānupāyā! whether it is proper, or possible, or advisable, or whether there is a suitable match, give your daughter in marriage to Teyalipuṭṭa. Then say, O Devānupāyā! what shall we give as a gift? Then the maid-servant says to those men of the inner quarters-This, O Devānupāyā! is my son Teyalipuṭṭa, he will do a favour for me for the sake of my daughter. Those men of the inner quarters honour him with abundant food, drink, eatables, and drinkables, flowers, clothes, and even ornaments.
Then they go out of the maid-servant's house, and as soon as they reach Teyalipuṭṭa's house, they inform Teyalipuṭṭa. Then the maid-servant, on some auspicious day, in some auspicious three-part-time, auspicious constellation, and auspicious moment, adorns her daughter with all ornaments, and makes her ready, and then, accompanied by her friends, relatives, and attendants, she goes out of the house, and then, with all pomp and ceremony, she reaches Teyalipuṭṭa's house, and then she gives her daughter in marriage to Teyalipuṭṭa herself. Then Teyalipuṭṭa receives his bride, and then he ties a thread with the adorned bride, and then he bathes himself with white and yellow pitchers, and then he performs the fire-sacrifice, and then he performs the hand-taking ceremony, and then he honours the bride and her friends, relatives, and attendants with abundant food, drink, eatables, and drinkables, flowers, clothes, and even ornaments. Then Teyalipuṭṭa lives happily with his bride.
Then the king of that city, in his kingdom, in his army, in his vehicles, in his treasury, in his storehouse, in his palace, in his fort, in his army, in his sons, mutilates, cuts off the fingers of the disobedient, cuts off the thumbs of the disobedient, and similarly mutilates the toes and thumbs, cuts off the ear-lobes, breaks the noses, mutilates the limbs. Then, on some previous occasion, at some previous time, the queen Paumavati, in her mind, in her thoughts, in her heart, in her intentions, had thought thus-If the king of that city, in his kingdom, in his army, in his vehicles, in his treasury, in his storehouse, in his palace, in his fort, in his army, in his sons, mutilates, cuts off the fingers of the disobedient, cuts off the thumbs of the disobedient, and similarly mutilates the toes and thumbs, cuts off the ear-lobes, breaks the noses, mutilates the limbs, then, if I give my daughter in marriage, then, surely, my daughter will be in danger of being killed or imprisoned by the king of that city. Thus she thought, and then she informed Teyalipuṭṭa, and said-Thus, O Devānupāyā! the king of that city, in his kingdom, in his army, in his vehicles, in his treasury, in his storehouse, in his palace, in his fort, in his army, in his sons, mutilates, cuts off the fingers of the disobedient, cuts off the thumbs of the disobedient, and

The Eager Rejection of the Child

I will tell you, O King, the secret of the city and the secret of the child, which was kept safe, protected, and nurtured by the queen. This child will be the food for you, for me, and for the queen, from the time it was born until it reaches adulthood.

The queen, the daughter of the king, heard this, and she agreed.

The queen, the daughter of the king, and the queen, the wife of the king, both conceived at the same time and both carried their children for the same length of time. The queen, the daughter of the king, gave birth to a child after nine months. On the same night that the queen, the daughter of the king, gave birth, the queen, the wife of the king, also gave birth to a child.

The queen, the daughter of the king, called her maid, and said to her, "Go, O maid, and tell the king the secret." The maid heard this, and went out through the back door. She went to the king's house, and when she reached the king, she said, "O King, the queen, the daughter of the king, has given birth." The king, hearing this, was very happy and went out with the maid. He entered the house through the back door, and went to the queen, the daughter of the king. He bowed his head and folded his hands, and said, "O King, what should I do?" The queen, the daughter of the king, said to the king, "O King, the king of the city has given birth to a child, and I, O King, have given birth to a child after nine months. O King, take this child, and it will be the food for you, for me, and for the queen." She placed the child in the king's hands. The king took the child from the queen, the daughter of the king, and kissed it. He went out through the back door, and went to his house, where his wife, the queen, was. He said to her, "O King, the king of the city has given birth to a child, and this child is the son of the king of the city, the daughter of the king. O King, take this child and keep it safe, protect it, and nurture it." He placed the child in the queen's hands. The queen took the child and kissed it. She went inside through the back door, and went to the queen, the daughter of the king. She placed the child in the queen's hands, and left.

The queen's maids took the child and went to the king of the city. They bowed their heads and folded their hands, and said, "O King, the queen, the daughter of the king, has given birth to a child."

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples
157

"She clasped her hands and said, 'Thus, indeed, Sami! Paumavati Devi gave me as a gift. Then, the king of Kanagaraha, in order to take possession of this gift, did many things, including causing me much suffering. Then, she said to the Tetiliputra, 'I will give you a gift, O noble householder!' Then, she said, 'Quickly, let us go to the city of Kanagaraha, so that this gift may be given to the king of Kanagaraha, and so that the gift may be enjoyed by us.' Then, she, the pot-bearer, was not dear, not beloved, not pleasing, not respected, not honored by the Tetiliputra, even though she was his wife. The Tetiliputra did not desire to hear her name, let alone see her or enjoy her. Then, she, the pot-bearer, thought, pondered, and reflected on the past, present, and future, and a thought arose in her mind: 'Indeed, I was dear, beloved, pleasing, respected, and honored by the Tetiliputra in the past. Now, I am not dear, not beloved, not pleasing, not respected, not honored. The Tetiliputra does not desire to hear my name, let alone enjoy me.' She was filled with sorrow and grief.

Then, the Tetiliputra saw her sorrow and grief, and said, 'Do not, O beloved of the gods! Be filled with sorrow and grief. You will cause me much suffering in terms of food, drink, clothing, and bedding. You will cause me to give alms to many monks, Brahmanas, and householders.' Then, she, the pot-bearer, was pleased by the Tetiliputra's words, and she agreed. She gave him much food, drink, clothing, and bedding, and she gave alms to many monks, Brahmanas, and householders.

Then, at that time, at that moment, there were many ascetics named Suvvyaya, who were well-behaved, well-disciplined, well-controlled, and well-versed in the scriptures. They were well-known and had many followers. They came to the city of Tetiliputra, and they entered the city with great joy. They lived in self-control and austerity, and they were well-behaved.

Then, some of these ascetics named Suvvyaya gathered together in a meeting, and they decided to go to the Tetiliputra's house. Then, she, the pot-bearer, saw these ascetics, and she was pleased. She got up from her seat, and she bowed and prostrated herself before them. She offered them much food, drink, clothing, and bedding. She said, 'Indeed, O ascetics! I was dear, beloved, pleasing, respected, and honored by the Tetiliputra in the past. Now, I am not dear, not beloved, not pleasing, not respected, not honored. The Tetiliputra does not desire to hear my name, let alone see me or enjoy me. You, O ascetics, are well-known, well-learned, and well-versed in the scriptures. You have traveled to many villages and towns, and you have seen many things.'

**The Scattering of the Eager Refusal**

Ahinḍa, many Rāisaras went to the house, and he was there.  I do not know him!  Did he perhaps do something by means of a **cuṇṇajoga** or a **kammaṇajoga** or a **kammajoga** or a **hiyuḍḍāvaṇa** or a **kāuḍḍāvaṇa** or an **ābhiōgiē** or a **vasīkaraṇa** or a **kouyakamma** or a **bhūikamma** or a **mūle kanda** or a **challi valli** or a **siliyā** or a **guliyā** or an **ōsaha** or a **bhesajja** or something obtained previously, so that I would be desirous of him again?

Then the elder Ājātā, having been told this, said to the Pottilā, "We, the Devāṇuppiyā, the Samanīta, the Nigganthīta, and the Gutabhaṃbhācarīta, are not worthy of being spoken to by you, let alone being spoken to, instructed, or invited.  We, the Devāṇuppiyā, will only speak about the **kevalipannatta** Dharma."

Then the Pottilā said to the elder Ājātā, "I wish, elder, that you would speak to me about the **kevalipannatta** Dharma."  Then the elder Ājātā spoke to the Pottilā about the **kevalipannatta** Dharma.  Then the Pottilā, having listened to the Dharma, with a firm and unwavering mind, said, "I believe, elder, in the Niggantha Pāvaṇa.  I accept, elder, the Niggantha Pāvaṇa."  And so on, as you have heard.  "I wish, elder, that I may be instructed by you in the **pañcāṇuvvaiya**, the **sattasikkhāvaiya**, and so on, and be ordained into the Dharma."  "Alas, Devāṇuppiyā, do not be attached!"  Then the Pottilā was instructed by the elder Ājātā in the **pañcāṇuvvaiya**, and so on, and was ordained into the Dharma.  Then the elder Ājātā bowed and paid homage, and welcomed her.  Then the Pottilā, having become a Samanōvāsiyā, went and so on, and became a **paḍilābhamanī** and lived.

Then, on that occasion, the Pottilā, in the past, in the time of her previous existence, while she was a householder, being mindful, having thought, desired, and conceived in her mind, thought, "I was formerly dear, beloved, and cherished by that son.  Now I am not dear, not beloved, not cherished, not cherished, and so on, and I have no enjoyment.  This, indeed, is my fault, and I will be reborn in the presence of the elder Ājātā."  She thought thus, and after a while, when that son came, she, having seen him, with her head bowed and her hands clasped in salutation, said, "Thus, Devāṇuppiyā, I have been reborn in the Dharma, in the presence of the elder Ājātā, and so on, and I have been reborn in the presence of the elder Ājātā."

Then that son said to the Pottilā, "Thus, Devāṇuppiyā, you, having become a **muṇḍā**

## Chapter 160: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Thus, you, the great king, were anointed with the royal anointment. All the people of the city gathered around. Then, those [Isar, Talavar, Madanviya, Kodumbiya, Ibha, Setthi, Senavai, Satthavaha, and others] anointed the young prince Kanagajjhaya with the royal anointment. Then, that prince Kanagajjhaya, the king, wandered about, enjoying the beauty of the Himalayas and the Malaya mountains, until he reached the royal palace.

Then, Queen Paumavati addressed King Kanagajjhaya, saying, "My son! Your [father, King Kanagaraha] ruled the kingdom until his death, and you are the son of his minister, Tetaliputta. Therefore, my son, you should honor, recognize, respect, and esteem that minister Tetaliputta. You should welcome him, provide him with a comfortable dwelling, praise him, offer him a seat, and increase his wealth." Then, that prince Kanagajjhaya listened to Queen Paumavati's words and did as she said, increasing his wealth.

Then, the divine Pottile, seeing Tetaliputta, preached the pure and perfect Dharma to him, but Tetaliputta did not understand. Then, the divine Pottile, with a mind filled with thoughts, desires, and intentions, thought, "Thus, King Kanagajjhaya honors Tetaliputta and increases his wealth, but even though he is preached to, Tetaliputta does not understand the Dharma. Therefore, this is a bad omen for me, as Kanagajjhaya is alienated from Tetaliputta." Thus, Kanagajjhaya became alienated from Tetaliputta.

Then, Tetaliputta, after some time, left his house, surrounded by many people, including his servants and guards, to go to King Kanagajjhaya. As he went, many people, including Isar, Talavar, Madanviya, Kodumbiya, Ibha, Setthi, Senavai, Satthavaha, and others, honored him, welcomed him, greeted him, bowed to him, and followed him, some walking in front, some behind, some on the left, and some on the right.

Then, Tetaliputta reached King Kanagajjhaya. Kanagajjhaya saw Tetaliputta approaching, but he did not honor him, welcome him, or greet him. He remained silent, with his face turned away. Then, Tetaliputta bowed to King Kanagajjhaya, but Kanagajjhaya remained silent, with his face turned away. Then, Tetaliputta, realizing Kanagajjhaya's alienation, became afraid and said, "My King Kanagajjhaya is angry with me. My King Kanagajjhaya is displeased with me. My King Kanagajjhaya is scornful of me. Therefore, I fear that my son, Kanagajjhaya, will kill me." Thus, he was afraid and remained there.

**If a Teliputra (oil-presser's son) has 250 houses, and he has to climb a difficult mountain, he would guard his journey with the same care as he would guard his 250 houses.**

**Just as a Teliputra would not be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised, nor would he fold his hands (in respect) when he sees a king, so too he would not be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised, nor would he fold his hands (in respect) when he sees a monk, nor would he be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised, nor would he fold his hands (in respect) when he sees a path, nor would he be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised, nor would he fold his hands (in respect) when he sees a back, nor would he be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised, nor would he fold his hands (in respect) when he sees a front.**

**Just as a Teliputra would guard his 250 houses, so too he would guard his home. If there are any outsiders in his home, such as servants, messengers, or brothers, he would not be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised. If there are any insiders in his home, such as his father, mother, or his son, he would not be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised.**

**Just as a Teliputra would guard his home, so too he would guard his bed. When he lies down on his bed, he would say to himself, "I am leaving my 250 houses, and I am leaving my home, and I am leaving my family, and I am leaving my friends, and I am leaving my relatives, and I am leaving my servants, and I am leaving my messengers, and I am leaving my companions, and I am leaving my wife, and I am leaving my children, and I am leaving my possessions, and I am leaving my wealth, and I am leaving my body, and I am leaving my life, and I am leaving my soul, and I am leaving my mind, and I am leaving my senses, and I am leaving my thoughts, and I am leaving my feelings, and I am leaving my desires, and I am leaving my attachments, and I am leaving my aversions, and I am leaving my ignorance, and I am leaving my karma, and I am leaving my rebirth, and I am leaving my suffering, and I am leaving my death, and I am leaving my liberation, and I am leaving my enlightenment, and I am leaving my Nirvana." And he would be careful not to be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised. He would be careful not to be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised. He would be careful not to be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised. He would be careful not to be careless, nor would he be negligent, nor would he be surprised.

Who will burn?  The Tetiliputra, the dry grass, the fire will be extinguished, who will burn?  The one with the wrong intention, as long as he lives.

Then, that Tetiliputra, the god, spoke in a way that was like a pot, and the Tetiliputra, who was not far away, stood there and said, "Oh, Tetiliputra!  In front, there is a storm, behind, there is the fear of elephants, on the side, there is blindness, in the middle, the rivers are flowing, in the village, the white ones are burning, in the white ones, the village is burning, Oh! Tetiliputra!  What is the remedy?"

Then, that Tetiliputra, the pot, spoke in this way, "Fear, oh!  is the renunciation, for the anxious, the right path, for the shade, food, for the thirsty, water, for the sick, medicine, for the lost, the secret, for the ambitious, the five senses, for the one who is tired, the vehicle, for the one who wants to cross, the wind, for the one who wants to be happy, the help.  For the one who is patient, the one who has teeth, the one who has conquered the senses, there is nothing more."

Then, that Tetiliputra, the god, spoke to the Tetiliputra, the minister, in this way, "You, Tetiliputra!

"I am worshipping and enjoying the Vinaya, thus I am happy," he said. 2 Just as a four-armed army of the Nāga queen, just as a city of the Ujjāyana, just as a Tetiliputra ascetic, he approaches. 2 He worships and prostrates to the Tetiliputra ascetic, and he says, "I am worshipping and enjoying the Vinaya, thus I am happy." He does not leave until he has been given permission. Then, that Tetiliputra ascetic, in the presence of the king of the Kankagajjha, explains the Dharma to him. Then, that Kankagajjha king, having heard the Dharma from the Tetiliputra ascetic, who is a Kevali, reflects on it and, after understanding it, accepts the five vows, the seven trainings, and the teachings of the Śramaṇa. 2 He becomes a Śramaṇa, a renunciant, and a non-violent being. Then, that Tetiliputra Kevali, after spending many years in the practice of Kevalihood, attains Siddhi. 15. The story of Marīci, as narrated in the Śrī Upadesha Prasāda, a work of the Kāṅkṣādhyāna.

Śrī Bharata Chakra-putra, Marīci-kumāra, once went with his father, the Chakra, to worship the Śrī Yugadi-jina. There, having heard the Śrī Syādvāda Dharma from the mouth of Śrī Mārudeva, he awakened and took the vow. He also recited the eleven chapters in front of the elders. He spent a long time with his master. On another occasion, he was afflicted by the heat of summer and thought, "Because of the arising of the karma of the covering of conduct, I am suffering." For, in the Śrī Vīracarita, it is said:

> I am unable to bear the heavy burden of the qualities of the Śrāmaṇya, like Mount Meru. I am without qualities, and I am desirous of worldly existence. It is better for me to bear it. 1
>
> What should I give up in the world? By giving up, I will be ashamed. I have found a way by which I will not be tired by the vow. 2
>
> These Śramaṇa Bhagavants are always free from the three staffs. Let me have the three staffs as my mark, since I have conquered the three staffs. 3
>
> These are bald-headed, with their hair and eyebrows shaved. I am a shaven-headed one, with a tuft of hair. I am a bearer of the great vow, and I am a bearer of the small vow. 4
>
> These are renunciants, without possessions. Let me have a ring and other things. These are deluded by delusion. Let me have an umbrella, since I am covered. 5
>
> These are without sandals, and they wander about, great sages. Let me have sandals, for the sake of the feet, and also for the sake of the great sages. 6
>
> These are fragrant with good conduct, and I am fragrant with bad conduct. Let me have sandalwood paste and other things, for the sake of fragrance. 7
>
> These are great sages, wearing white clothes, without any dye. Let me have saffron-colored clothes, since I am a renunciant. 8
>
> These renounce water, which is a great torment to living beings. Let me have a bath and drink milk, in moderation, and also for the sake of the great sages. 9

Thus, having considered with his own wisdom, for the sake

## Chapter 164: The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

While traveling, the Master stayed in a village near a virtuous woman. There, after bowing to the Master, Bharata asked about the nature of the cycle of the Arhats. The Master explained it. Then Bharata asked, "Is there anyone in this assembly, in this land of Bharata, who will be a Jina like you?" The Master replied, "Your son, Marichi, will be the last Tirthankara, a hero named Vira, here in Bharata. The first Vasudeva will be born in Videha, and the Chakravartin will also be born there."

Hearing this, Bharata circumambulated Marichi and, bowing, said, "Your wandering life is not worthy of worship, but you are a future Arhat, and therefore worthy of worship." He spoke everything that the Jina had said. Hearing this, Marichi, filled with joy, exclaimed three times, "I will be the first Vishnu!"

"I will be a Chakravartin in the silent city. I will be the last Arhat, my path is complete."

"I am the first of the Vasudevas, my father is the Chakravartin, my grandfather is the Tirthankara, my lineage is the best."

Thus, he boasted, earning the karma of a low lineage. Later, he suffered from a disease. While being cared for by the monks, he became weak and thought, "These monks are heartless, they don't even care to look at me, let alone take care of me. Or perhaps they are worried about me and don't even take care of their own, so how can they take care of me who is sick? Therefore, I will make a disciple." Thinking this, Marichi became eager.

Later, Kapila, a son of his lineage, met him. He was seeking the Arhat's Dharma and informed him of it. Then Kapila asked, "Is there no Dharma in your path?" Knowing that Marichi was neglecting the Jina Dharma, he wanted a disciple and said, "There is Dharma in the Jain path, and there is also Dharma in my path."

Kapila became his disciple, teaching him false Dharma. Marichi, too, earned countless births in the ocean of samsara.

Marichi, realizing this, died after following the prescribed fast. He became a deva in the Brahma Loka, living for a period of ten kalpas.

He made disciples like Surya and others, teaching them his own practices. He suffered in the Brahma Loka, and Kapila also became an immortal.

He remembered his past lives and, due to delusion, returned to the earth. He taught Surya and others about the harm they had done.

Then, the teachings became dense, and the vision arose. Because the practices are easy to achieve, people often follow them.

## Chapter 16: The Example of Acharya Manguna in the Shrine of the Teachings of Shri

In Mathura, Acharya Manguna lived with five hundred monks. People were delighted by his teachings and called him the leader of the age. Because:

"Leaving aside other tasks, ignoring obstacles and disrespect, he served the monks with devotion. People, as if under his control, served only him."

Because:

Chapter: - 2 Collection of Examples
Those people constantly indulge in delicious, sweet, and other enjoyable foods. Gradually, due to their karma, they developed a fondness for taste, leading them to acquire a permanent residence. Then, over time, due to the weight of their attachment to taste, they became lazy in their practice of meditation, teachings, and other actions. Due to the weight of their wealth, they became falsely proud and lazy in their proper humility and other virtues. Due to the weight of their taste, they became attached to their land, family, and other connections, becoming lazy in their search for liberation. Gradually, they died there and were reborn as a Yaksha, the guardian of the cemetery, near the city gate. Seeing his past life through the process of disintegration, he felt remorse and thought, "This is the time I have reached due to my past actions." Thinking this, he extended a large tongue from the mouth of the Yaksha statue in front of the ascetics who were leaving the city. He does this every day. One day, a courageous ascetic asked him, "Who are you, sir? Why do you show your tongue like that?" Then, with sorrow, the Yaksha revealed himself and said, "I am a cripple on the path of Dharma, your Guru, the venerable Manguna. Due to my negligence, I incurred the loss of my original merit, committed a great violation of vows, and became a Yaksha in this city. You should not be like those who are greatly attached to taste. I do this to inform you that I have fallen due to the taste of my tongue." Hearing this, they were filled with wonder and their minds became firm in their renunciation of taste. They spread the teaching in front of everyone, "Victory over the senses is the ultimate attainment for humans."
16. The story of the King of the Pond Lilies in the Sri Upadesha Mala, a collection of teachings on the practice of meditation.
The Pond Lily and the Lotus Lily were brothers, kings in the city of Pond Lily. Once, a certain sage came to their city. Inspired by his teachings, Pond Lily decided to renounce the world and, calling his brother, said, "I will renounce the world after you are crowned king." His brother said, "What? Should I go to hell? I don't want the kingdom. I will also renounce the world." The lord said, "This is the right thing to do for someone like you, but it is difficult." He said, "Nothing is difficult for those who are capable." Thus, even though he was dissuaded, he left, leaving the kingdom without a leader. Later, after many years of renunciation, due to the unbearable nature of the various hardships and afflictions, the result of his karma, and his innate, long-standing attachment to worldly pleasures, Lotus Lily, whose vows had been broken, thought, "I will return to the kingdom I had renounced earlier." With this intention, he came to the city and stayed in the garden outside. The city guard informed the king, "Is he alone?" The king, accompanied by some trusted men, came to see him. He saw him sitting under a tree, holding a bowl and surrounded by blades of grass. The king, understanding his intention, told his ministers, "This one, whom I dissuaded, has taken vows. Now, let him take the kingdom. We will return to this." Saying this, they gave him the royal insignia. He accepted the insignia. He went to his Guru. The other one, entering the vast expanse of the kingdom, ate excessively that very day and, suffering from indigestion, cried out in pain. He was a broken promise, unworthy of respect. Due to the condemnation of the people, he died in a fit of intense, furious anger and went to the seventh hell. Pond Lily, returning to his Guru, said

## Chapter 166: The Discourse on the Rejection of the Eager

**17. The Story of the King**

In the treasury of stories, the story of the King is found in the chapter on the hopes and aspirations. In the city of Kusumpura, which is situated in the land of Videha, where the weight of the mountains and the serpents is heavy, there lived a king. ||1||

Where the people are numerous and the city is full of jewels, the king was the best of men, a true king. ||2||

His name was Kusumsehara, the jewel among kings, whose strong arms were like the gates of a fortress. ||3||

He was born to Jayalal, who carried the weight of the earth on his shoulders, and he was a great king, full of joy and delight. ||4||

His queen was named Visalacchhi, born of a great family, with a beautiful face and a charming smile. ||5||

The king, enjoying the pleasures of the world with his queen, was happy and content. But one day, a time came when he was blessed with a son. ||6||

The son was born with a beautiful body, like a full moon, and he was blessed with all the auspicious signs. ||7||

His name was Muldeva, and he was a charming child, with a heart full of love and affection. ||8||

He was skilled in all the arts, with a beautiful body and a charming smile. He reached the age of youth, full of joy and vigor. ||9||

One day, the king, surrounded by his ministers, asked, "What is the state of the people? Are they happy and content?" ||10||

The king's minister, his face shining with the light of wisdom, replied, "Your Majesty, the people are gathered at the palace gates, their faces filled with sorrow. What is the reason for their distress?" ||11||

The king, his face shining with the light of his wisdom, said, "Bring them before me, quickly!" ||12||

The people were brought before the king, and they were treated with respect and honor. They bowed low before him, their heads touching the ground. ||13||

The king asked, "What is the reason for your sorrow? Is there any thief or robber in the kingdom? Is there any injustice being done?" ||14||

"Is there anyone who is envious of your wealth and power, who is trying to overthrow your kingdom?" ||15||

The people stood silent, their faces filled with sorrow. Then, a wealthy merchant stepped forward, his face filled with tears. ||16||

"Your Majesty, we are not afraid of any enemy, nor of any danger in this world. We are safe under your protection. But we are afraid of the king's minister, who is a wicked man. He is lustful and cruel, and he is oppressing the people." ||17||

"He has taken away our jewels and our horses, and he is ruling the kingdom with an iron fist. We beg you, Your Majesty, to save us from this wicked man." ||18||

The king, hearing the people's complaints, was filled with anger. He ordered his minister to be arrested and punished. ||19||

The people were overjoyed, and they praised the king for his justice and his compassion. The king, seeing the people's happiness, was filled with joy. ||20||

A young prince, like a lion in the forest, was approached by his father's minister at that place. ||21||
The minister, with his body adorned with jewels and rays of light, bowed to the prince, like a lotus flower blooming in a pond. ||22||
The prince, with his body shining like the sun, was praised by the minister.
"O prince of the Kshatriya clan! This is a great opportunity for you to show your prowess." ||23||
The prince, feeling the humiliation of being defeated by his guru, and unable to bear the insult of his father, thought in his heart. ||24||
"They abandon wealth, they renounce possessions, they give up their kingdom, they abandon their family. Even in death, they do not abandon their dharma." ||25||
"Even in death, they do not abandon their dharma, they are fearless like a lion roaring on a mountain." ||26||
Thinking this, the prince bowed to his father's minister and went to his wife. ||27||
The prince, with his wealth and army, left the city, fearless and strong, like a lion with a sharp sword, ready to destroy his enemies. ||28||
He went to the villages, towns, and cities, with his army, like a small ant carrying a large load. ||29||
There, a cruel and wicked king, always engaged in war, lived happily, with his army and his desires. ||30||
The prince saw a beautiful Kinnara woman there, adorned with ornaments and jewels, and surrounded by guards. ||31||
He sent his servant to her, with love and respect, and the servant said to her. ||32||
"O beautiful woman! Your beauty has captivated my master. O Kinnara! You are a thief of hearts, even from within your home." ||33||
The prince said, "Who is this woman of yours?" The servant replied, "She is the wife of Devadatta, the conqueror of the world." ||34||
The prince said, "I have no faith in women, they are fickle-minded, they are deceitful, they are cunning." ||35||
"Even young women are not to be trusted, they are deceitful and cunning. How can one trust women who are fickle-minded and deceitful?" ||36||
"Their love is based on desire, their bodies are beautiful, but their hearts are not pure. They are like a beautiful flower that has no fragrance." ||37||
"If she does not come, then go and bring her here." The servant said to the woman, "My master wants to see you." ||38||
"Come once, come to my house. The good men are those who are kind and compassionate." ||39||
The prince, thinking that she would come, waited for a while, but she did not come. Then, he struck her with his fist, and she fell to the ground. ||40||

And the Khayaka-Koodaka-Vadchaadu-Yeraikaliya leprosy, what is its work? It is to be avoided, it is very harmful, even in work. ||63|| Veena-Vinoy-Vinnaan-Pagarisuppanna-Kittira-Maniyam. If it is so, then it is very harmful, wealth!
Avoid it. ||64|| Then Devadatta says, "Many generations have passed, what is this? What will be the benefit of wealth to you?" ||65||
From there, the wealthy merchant, like a cloud in the sky, lives there.
Saibhadda-Saal-Kaliyo, the benefactor, is the one who gives the gift. ||66|| He desires to see the beautiful woman in Ujjain in the spring month with various ornaments. ||67|| He thinks in his heart, "Where will the union be with this woman? Or will there be a wealth of money, or will there be a subjugation of women?" ||68|| Thinking this, he went to the woman, who was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. She was also attracted to the merchant. ||69|| Thus, they went together to Devadatta's house. She was also very attracted to the merchant. ||70||
Then she again asked her mother, "What is the matter, mother? Is the garden blocked by a tree or a stone?" ||71|| Devadatta said, "Mother, wealth is not obtained by qualities. "
The mother said, "Son, the merchant is also a man of qualities." ||72|| Devadatta said, "If it is so, mother, let us test it." Saying this, he sent a servant to the merchant with rice. ||73|| Then she said, "Go to the merchant and tell him, 'Just as you desire sugarcane today, so do I desire you.'" ||74||
Then the merchant filled a whole cart with sugarcane and sent it to her.
Devadatta said, "Mother, what should I do now?" ||75|| "Fill a whole cart with sugarcane, roots and all, and send it to the merchant's house." ||76|| "Mother, the knowledge of the merchant is obtained, examine the merchant's roots." Saying this, he sent the servant to the merchant. ||77|| Then she went to the merchant's house, saying, "Today, I desire sugarcane, please bring it." ||78|| Then, with a strong, sharp, and quick-moving sword, he cut off a piece of sugarcane. ||79|| He cut off the sugarcane with a strong, sharp, and quick-moving sword, and then he threw it into the fire. ||80|| Then she began to tremble, her body trembling with fear. "Mother, the difference between the merchant and the knowledge of the merchant is like this!" ||81||

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Then Kuttanī pondered, "With what words should I speak to him in the house? Should I speak softly? Thinking this, she said to the young man, "You have come." ||82||

"Just as a very devoted wife, devoted to her husband, adorns herself with clothes and enjoys all pleasures, so you are adorned." ||83||

"Then why should this one be expelled from my house?  The young man said, "What is this, my dear? What are you saying?" ||84||

"Akka said, "This is not your fault, my dear.  So, let us go to the village of Kavada today.  Let us go." ||85||

"So that you, my dear, can enjoy yourself with the devoted wife of Muladeva, along with the Devadatta family, in my house." ||86||

"Therefore, let us go out, let us enjoy ourselves, let us go out.  Let us go out, let us enjoy ourselves, let us go out.  Let us go out, let us enjoy ourselves, let us go out.

Thinking this, he said, "Even for me, what should I do? I will protect the *satosaṃ* (true faith), I will be liberated, I will be honored, that is my goal." ||101||
"Should I stay here, stained by the dirt of disrespect and the mark of the teacher?" ||102||
"With strength and support, with the best intelligence, courage, and help, I will cross over, I will cross over the mountain, the river, the deep water." ||103||
"Even with the help of *vāyāmeta* (effort), I will seek, until I reach the forest. There is only one *brahmaṇa* (knowledgeable person) who can help me." ||104||
"The *cakkavattī* (universal monarch) named *Sadḍhaḍo* is very strong. He is known as the *jaṇakayanigghiṇasammā* (one who has overcome the *jaṇakaya* (worldly attachments) and is righteous) and the *nigghiṇattanā* (one who has overcome the *tanā* (desire))." ||105||
"Relying on his strength and power, I will cross over with ease." Thinking this, he went with the *kaysambhāsa* (one who speaks the truth). ||106||
"At that time, *Sadḍhaḍo*, equipped with a water-filled vessel, was ready to go. Looking at the water, he saw a *sattu* (living being) like a single *āgī* (a type of bird)." ||107||
"He was not invited by *Mūladeva* (the founder of the Jain tradition) even with words. He is thinking, 'I will surely forget this great dream.'" ||108||
"But he is not deceived by the rules. He is thinking, 'In my mind, *Mūladeva* is the *bhocca* (food) and the *brahmaṇa* is the *patta* (leaf)." ||109||
"He is chewing with his mouth, his hands are covered in dirt, he is holding a precious jewel, his teeth are grinding, and he is shouting in excitement." ||110||
"I will stay in this dense forest for a moment, until the sun rises. I will stay in the middle of the forest, until the sun rises." ||111||
"After that, I will go forward. This is what the young *brahmaṇa* said. I will stay for one moment, and then I will go forward again." ||112||
"In the meantime, the young *brahmaṇa* saw the *āvaikaliya* (danger) and thought, 'My friend, for the sake of the *attha* (benefit), I will go far into the water.'" ||113||
"Then, *Sadḍhaḍo* ate, and the *āgī* also ate. He was not invited by *vāyāmeta* (effort), even though he was in a difficult situation." ||114||
"He was not invited by *bīyadiya* (the one who gives seeds) either, nor by his mind. On that day, in the forest, there were two *aikaṃta* (solitary) *brahmaṇas*." ||115||

The wealthy king, the lord of the land, was a generous giver of wealth. The wise Muni, the Brahman, pondered in his heart.  ||116||  "You are a deceiver, O Blessed One! But what have you done today?  ||117||  Knowing my wealth, I gave you this village."  ||117||  Having said this, the king, the lord of the land, went to the village in the afternoon.  ||118||  He was eager to beg for alms, his bowl filled with the leaves of the Karaka tree.  ||118||  He wanted to fill his bowl with the alms of the Jain community, following the path of the pond.  ||119||  He who goes out from there, will meet a single Muni.  ||119||  He who has spent a month in fasting, with a body full of wealth and a mind free from suffering,  ||120||  enters the village on the day of the Parana.  ||120||  The king, the lord of the land, thought, "This is the marriage of my son.  ||121||  This is like a Kalpa tree, which is seen in the forest."  ||121||  Thinking this, he spoke with a heart full of devotion, his body trembling with joy.  ||122||  "Please have mercy on me, O Muni, among the Jain community!"  ||122||  The Muni, having received the fourfold purity of wealth, said, "This is not the time for alms."  ||123||  The prince, who was standing nearby, was pleased and said, "Alms are for the sake of the people, for the sake of the Parana."  ||124||  Having said this, the Muni, the lord of the gods, said, "O Great One, it is better for you to give alms to the needy.  ||125||  Give alms to the Jain community, to Devadatta, to the thousand teeth, and to the kingdom."  ||125||  As the prince spoke, the lord of the gods said, "The fruit of the Muni's alms will soon be yours."  ||126||  After the remaining alms were given, the prince went to the palace.  ||127||  The Muni, the lord of the gods, went to the city of Vinnayada.  ||127||  He arrived in the city of Vinnayada, having traveled by the path of the righteous.  ||128||  He slept in the house of the teacher and saw a dream in the middle of the night.  ||128||  He saw a beautiful, radiant, and luminous image of a woman, entering the house.  ||129||  He woke up and told the dream to the others.  ||130||  They said, "You will get a sweet, delicious, and beautiful garland."  ||130||  On the next day, while he was sitting in his house,  ||131||  he received a sweet garland from the alms of the pure ones.  ||131||  The prince, thinking that the Muni was the cause of his happiness,  ||132||  told the story of the dream to the people of the city, who were eager to hear it.  ||132||  In the morning, when the sun rose, the prince filled a basket with flowers.  ||133||  He went to the Muni, who was sitting in his house, with great

This having been heard, the king was very happy in that city. A man with a shining face was given the city's wealth on that day. ||136||
Thinking how he would enjoy himself in the city, he took a sword in the king's palace and killed the king's guards. ||137||
When he went out from there, he was caught by the guards. ||138||
He was bound and taken to the king's court. ||138||
"He is a thief," the king's ministers said, "he has killed the king's guards." ||139||
"What will happen now?" the prince thought. ||140||
He was very sad and worried about the city's people. ||140||
The king died without a son, and the ministers, the nobles, and the people of the city were very sad. ||141||
They went to the Jain temple and worshipped the five divine beings. ||141||
The king's soul went to hell because of his past bad deeds. ||142||
He was born in a city with three-storied temples and beautiful palaces. ||142||
The people of the city saw him outside the city, riding on an elephant, his whole body covered in red sandalwood paste. ||143||
He had a garland of flowers around his neck, and he was wearing a crown. ||144||
He was surrounded by a group of thieves, who were playing drums and cymbals. ||144||
The king's guards caught the thief and tied him up. ||145||
The king's minister, Harisvara, was very happy. ||145||
He took a pot of water and sprinkled it on the ground. ||146||
He held a white umbrella over the king's head. ||146||
A loud sound of victory was heard, and the people of the city were very happy. ||147||
The king was seated on a throne, surrounded by his ministers and nobles. ||148||
The ministers and nobles said, "This is the new king, Vikramaraja, the great king." ||149||
"Whoever does not obey my orders will not be forgiven." ||150||
The king's ministers were very happy. ||150||
The king was very happy to have become king. ||151||
He was very powerful and ruled the kingdom well. ||151||
The king thought, "I have become king with the help of thousands of soldiers. I will enjoy this kingdom." ||152||
But
"What is the use of this beautiful kingdom, which is ruled by Devadatta?" ||153||
"What is the use of this kingdom, which is full of love and happiness?" ||153||
The king sent a letter to the king of Ujjain. ||154||
He wrote, "I have heard that Devadatta is a very good king." ||154||
"If you agree, I will send my son to him to learn from him." ||155||
The king of Ujjain read the letter and said, "Is this letter written by a wise man?" ||156||
"What is special about this kingdom? Why should I send my son to him?" ||157||
The king of Ujjain said, "I will send my son to him. I will do what you ask." ||158||

"I know, my dear son, that you are not defeated by thirst. But there is no water in my vicinity, what should I do?" (7)
"Now, drink the river water and kill the living beings. Even a forbidden act is to be performed in times of distress by the wise." (8)
As it is said, "Even a forbidden act should be performed in times of distress, where inaction is completely harmful. When the royal road is very slippery due to heavy rain, even the wise sometimes travel on a side path." (9)
"This is a distress of death, how can it be overcome? You should consider the five great sins in the presence of a good teacher." (10)
Saying this, he crossed the river and thought, "My son will surely be ashamed to give me water when he sees me." (11)
"A virtuous person, even if he is pure, is afraid while performing an act. I will slowly move away from his sight." (12)
Thinking thus, he moved forward and soon reached the river. Even though he was thirsty, he did not drink the water, being firm in his vow. (13)
"Others say that the child was greatly distressed by the living beings. His tongue, mouth, and chest were drying up, he thought." (14)
"I will drink even the undrinkable, for water is not undrinkable at this time. I will perform penance later in the presence of my teacher." (15)
Thinking thus, he scooped up water with his cupped hands and brought it to his mouth. As soon as he did so, he became aware. (16)
"How can I, who know the Jain teachings, drink this? The Jinas have said that even a drop of water contains countless living beings." (17)
"Frightened, the aquatic creatures, the stationary creatures like algae, etc., are in the water. By drinking it, he would become a killer of all." (18)
"How many days do those who are protected live? Who is capable of protecting their lives by killing others?" (19)
"This is a living being, I will not kill it at all." Deciding thus, he slowly released the water from his cupped hands into the river. (20)
Even though he was a child, he had the courage of a grown-up. He then crossed the riverbank. He was unable to walk due to thirst. (21)
With his mind steadfast in Dharma, even though he was overcome by thirst, he remembered the five great vows and went to heaven in distress. (22)
"Using your knowledge of the past, knowing your previous birth, go forward and see your father, enter his body and then follow him." (23)
The sage Dhanasharma followed him, and then the celestial being followed him. Seeing his son approaching, he was happy and stood still. (24)
(Pair) Then, out of compassion for the monks, the celestial being Dhanasharma created many cowherds in the air. (25)
Having obtained buttermilk and other things from them, the virtuous ones regained their health. Like nectar, they drank from the pools of nectar, becoming free from old age. (26)
Thus, they lived happily, roaming in the cowherds created by him. They crossed the forest and reached the last cowherd. (27)
As they were going further, one of them wanted to know his own form. The celestial being made him forget. (28)
Having gone a long distance and remembering his form, the vow-bound man became worried. He did not see his own form in

In the city of Rajagriha, there lived a man named Dhanasharma. He was a poor man who lived in a small hut. He was a beggar and would go out every day to beg for food. He would carry a begging bowl and a cloth bag with him. He would go to the market and beg from the people.

One day, he went to the market and saw a lot of people eating and drinking. He was very hungry and asked them for some food. But they all ignored him. He was very angry and went to the top of a hill. He sat down and started to cry. He was so angry that he cursed the people of the city.

He said, "May you all suffer like I am suffering!"

As he was cursing, a stone fell from the hill and hit him on the head. He died instantly.

The people of the city heard the sound of the stone falling and came to see what had happened. They saw Dhanasharma lying dead on the ground. They were very sad and realized that they had been wrong to ignore him.

**Chapter 20: The Story of the Ascetic**

The Lord said, "In the city of Rajagriha, there was a king named Potana. He was a very kind and compassionate king. He was known as Soma Chandra because he was like the moon in his gentleness.

His queen was also a very virtuous woman. She was known as Dharma Dharini because she was a follower of the Dharma. She was a beautiful woman and was known for her wisdom and intelligence.

One day, the king and queen were walking in the forest when they saw an ascetic. The ascetic was wearing a loincloth and had a long beard. He was very thin and looked very weak.

The king and queen asked the ascetic, "Why are you so thin and weak?"

The ascetic said, "I am an ascetic. I have renounced the world and have given up all my possessions. I live on the food that I can beg for. I am not interested in the pleasures of the world. I am only interested in the Dharma."

The king and queen were impressed by the ascetic's devotion to the Dharma. They asked him to stay with them in the palace. The ascetic agreed and stayed with them for many years.

The king and queen learned a lot from the ascetic. They learned about the importance of the Dharma and the importance of giving up worldly attachments. They learned that true happiness comes from within and not from external things.

The ascetic lived a long and happy life. He died peacefully in the palace. The king and queen were very sad when he died. They realized that they had lost a true friend and a great teacher.

The king and queen continued to follow the Dharma after the ascetic's death. They ruled their kingdom justly and compassionately. They were known for their kindness and generosity. They were loved by their people and were remembered for their good deeds."

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples

She, sitting by the window, saw a pile of bangles on her husband's lap. She herself began to open them with her lotus-like hands. ||3|| She saw the king's hair turning white on his head. Accepting the situation, she recognized it as old age. ||4|| She spoke to the king, "My lord! A messenger has arrived." Looking around, the king also asked, "What is seen here?" ||5|| The queen pointed to the king's white hair and said, "My dear! This king of hair is praiseworthy, a messenger of Dharma. ||6|| It is the third age, like a weapon, a killer of youth. Seeing the white hair on his head, the king was distressed. ||7|| He said to the queen, "My dear! Are you ashamed of old age? Even seeing a single white hair, if you are so distressed, ||8|| then by announcing it on the drums, the whole world will be forbidden. It is not as if you should announce your old age even by words. ||9|| The king said, "My dear, I am not distressed by seeing white hair. This distress has another reason, my life's queen! ||10|| Our ancestors, who did not see white hair, took vows. But I, dear, am addicted to worldly pleasures, even though I have white hair. ||11|| I will take the vow even in this state. But how can the kingdom be entrusted to a son who is still a child? ||12|| Or, if I want to take the vow, what is the use of the kingdom and the son? My dear! You take the vow, and you raise your son. ||13|| The queen said, "My lord, I cannot live without you. A true wife follows her husband, wherever and whenever. ||15|| Therefore, even if you give the kingdom to our son, I will again serve you in the forest, like a shadow to your body. ||15|| Like a tree in the forest, our son will grow by his own actions. Even though he is a child, he is like a happy moon, let him grow, what is it to me? ||16|| Then, after Soma Chandra, he entrusted the kingdom to his son and, leaving the world, became an ascetic, accompanied by his wife and nurse. ||17|| He lived in a hermitage for some time, alone. He performed severe austerities, eating dry leaves and other things. ||18|| He took Palasha leaves and built a hut in the hermitage. He made a cool shade and a stream of nectar for the deer and other animals. ||19|| He brought sweet water and fruits of trees for his wife, bound by the threads of love. ||20|| There, too, the queen, full of devotion to her husband, made a bed for him with soft grass. ||21|| Then, she ground the ripe fruits and made a paste. She took care of him during the day and lit lamps at night. ||22|| She smeared the courtyard of the hermitage with cow dung from the forest. She cleaned it often for the comfort of her husband. ||23|| There in the hermitage, the couple nurtured the young deer. Not knowing the hardship of austerity, they spent some time. ||24|| The queen, who was the embodiment of contentment and happiness, conceived. The fetus grew gradually, without any pain. ||25|| The queen gave birth to a son, with no less than perfect qualities. He was like a lamp filled with oil, illuminating the delivery room with his radiance. ||26|| In the hermitage, he was wrapped in bark cloth. His father named him Valakalchari, after the bark cloth.

## Chapter 178: The Story of the Rejection of the Eager One

The king's son was afflicted with a severe illness, and his mother, the queen, passed away. He was left without a mother, like a child without a teacher.  

The king, overwhelmed with grief, entrusted the infant to a wet nurse, feeding him with the milk of a wild cow. He would often offer the child to the moon and the sun for protection. 

However, the wet nurse also passed away after some time. The king, guided by fate, mourned the loss of his queen as if she were still alive. 

Despite the loss of his wet nurse, the king continued to feed the child with the milk of the wild cow. He would carry the child in his arms, either while sitting or lying down. 

The child grew up gradually, becoming capable of walking and playing. He would spend his days playing with the young animals of the forest, collecting firewood, and preparing his own food. 

The king, named Somachandra, raised his son in the harshness of the forest, teaching him self-reliance and discipline. 

As the child grew into a young man, he became skilled in all tasks, including caring for his father and wearing the simple clothes of a forest dweller. 

He would diligently collect fruits and food for his father, carrying his belongings and serving him with utmost devotion. He lived a life of complete celibacy, wearing only bark cloth and never even knowing the names of women. 

One day, while living in the forest, the king, Somachandra, heard about his son's birth from his queen's womb. He wondered about his brother, questioning how he would ever meet him. 

The king's heart was filled with longing and a deep desire to see his brother. He ordered his artists to travel to the forest where his son lived, to paint a portrait of the young man. 

He instructed them to capture the image of his son, born from the lotus feet of his father, the one who lived in the forest, and bring it back to him quickly. 

The artists, understanding the king's command, set out for the forest, guided by the king's instructions. 

They reached the sacred forest where the young man lived, wearing only bark cloth. With their exceptional skills, they painted the young man's portrait, capturing his likeness as accurately as a mirror reflection. 

They returned to the king, presenting him with the portrait of his son. The king, upon seeing the image, was struck by its resemblance to himself. He realized that his son was truly a part of him, a reflection of his own being. 

Overwhelmed with joy, the king exclaimed, "By fortune, I have seen my brother!" He embraced the portrait, holding it close to his heart. 

Seeing the young man in the portrait, dressed in bark cloth, the king was moved to tears. He wept uncontrollably, like a waterfall cascading down a mountain. 

He declared, "My son, it is right for you to follow this path of austerity. Your life in the forest is not fitting for a child like you." 

He lamented, "I am lost in the pleasures of the kingdom, playing like a swan. My brother, like a wild animal, lives a life of hardship in the forest." 

He continued, "He is like a wild creature, difficult to tame. It is a burden to have him in my kingdom, as he would be a claimant to the throne." 

The king, filled with sorrow for his brother's plight, decided to bring him back to the palace. He instructed his cunning courtesans to go to the forest, disguised as ascetics. 

He commanded them to lure his son back to the palace, using their charm

## The Story of the Eagerly Rejected Wanderer

I

The charioteer, smiling, said to the man in rags, "This deed of theirs is indeed theirs, there is no fault in these deer." 78. The charioteer gave the man in rags sweet cakes. He ate them, immersed in the pleasure of their taste, and said, 79. "I have eaten such forest fruits before. They were given to me by the great sages who live in the hermitage of Potana." 80.  He became eager to go to Potana, enticed by the taste of the cakes. He was repelled by the harshness of the astringent fruits like bilva and amalaka. 81. The charioteer had a fight with a thief, a man of evil intent. The charioteer killed the thief with a strong blow. 82. The thief said, "Even the death of an enemy is praiseworthy. You have defeated me with your blow, I am pleased, human!" 83. "There is much wealth here, take it, sir!" The three of them loaded the wealth onto the chariot. 84. The charioteer, having reached Potana, said to the man in rags, "This is the hermitage of Potana, which you desired." 85. The charioteer gave some wealth to the sage's son, smiling and saying, 86. "One should not enter this hermitage without offering something. One should give something to the hermitage, without expecting anything in return." 87. "Where should I go? What should I do?" The sage, looking around the city, wandered about. 88. He, with the mind of a sage, was foolish about men and women. He was mocked by the townspeople, who blew on him like a breeze. 89. While wandering in the city, he entered the house of a prostitute, like a released arrow falling swiftly. 90.

At the time of his entry, Sahadevi also saw elephants and other great dreams, fourteen in number. 2. In due time, she gave birth to a son, marked with all auspicious signs, with a form that was non-dual, with the radiance of a golden jambu fruit. 3. The king, with a great celebration that brought joy to the world, named him Sanatkumara. 4. The child, with a golden complexion, was beautiful like a young boy. His eyes delighted the people, and he grew gradually. 5. He wandered among the kings, like a white cloud among lotuses, shining with his beauty. 6. With his incomparable beauty, even as a child, he captivated the eyes and minds of all who saw him. 7. He learned the Vedas, the Shastras, and all knowledge from his mother, reciting them with a playful smile. 8. He took up the weapons and the arts of war, and the science of economics, as if they were pillars supporting his own shoulders. 9. 
He mastered all other arts with ease. He grew gradually, becoming a pure repository of knowledge. 10.

## Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

189
He, with a stature exceeding forty cubits, attained youth from childhood, like a mortal ascending to heaven. ||11||
He had a great friend, the son of the Kalindi, named Mahendrasura, renowned for his valor. ||12||
On the arrival of spring, one day, he went with the son of Kalindi to the Makaranda garden, out of curiosity, to play. ||13||
There, he played with his friends, like Sanatkumara, the son of Girvana, in Nandana. ||14||
Then, the king's horse-master, Prahino, brought forth four horses, with five lines, marked with all auspicious signs. ||15||
One, named Jaladhikallola, as restless as the waves of the ocean, he gave to Sanatkumara. ||16||
Leaving his play, the prince mounted the steed. Among the princes, the fascination for elephants and horses is always great. ||17||
With one hand he raised the reins, and with the other he guided the horse, touching the seat with his thighs. ||18||
He raced with great speed, almost touching the earth with his feet, and he looked around to see the other horses. ||19||
As the prince pulled the reins, the horse, contrary to training, ran faster and faster. ||20||
Even while the other princes were racing, the horse, like a Rakshasa in the form of a horse, suddenly disappeared. ||21||
The horse, with the prince mounted, became invisible in an instant, like the moon disappearing in the clouds, even before the eyes of the kings. ||22||
The horse-army, with its horses, pursued the prince, who was carried away by the horse, like a boat carried by the river current. ||23||
"He goes, he goes, that horse! These are his footprints, and these are his foam-white marks," the people exclaimed. ||24||
Then, a fierce wind arose, like a full Brahmaanda-bhastika, a premature night, like a darkness that obscures everything. ||25||
The directions were covered with dust, like a swarm of locusts, and the armies were paralyzed, unable to move even a step. ||26||
The footprints of the horse, as it ran, were all erased by the dust-mountains. ||27||
Neither low, nor high, nor solid, nor trees, nothing was visible. The whole world seemed to have entered the underworld. ||28||
The foolish soldiers were bewildered, like travelers lost in a sea filled with water. ||29||
Mahendra Singh bowed to the horse-commander and said, "O Lord, this is the work of fate, the misfortune of this one. ||30||
Otherwise, where is the prince, and where is the horse in a distant land? And how could the prince have mounted this unknown horse? ||31||
Where is the prince, abducted by this wild horse? And where is the dust-covered path, where the wind blows? ||32||
Even though fate has conquered, like a king conquering his vassals, I will search for my friend, who is like my own self, and bring him back. ||33||
In the caves of the mountains, on the peaks, in the forests, in the strongholds, in the valleys, ||34||
In the holes of the earth, in the depths of the rivers, in the waterless lands, in the difficult places, ||35||

## Chapter 182: The Scattered Rejection of the Eager

Even with a small retinue, or even alone, the search for the prince is like a slight burden for a traveler.  ||36||

Where the army of the god is vast and boundless, the entry is like that of an elephant into a narrow lane. ||37||

Having said this repeatedly, the fire-footed one was turned back, and he went to the city, sorrowful. ||38||

With a small retinue, like an invincible elephant, Mahendra Singh suddenly entered the great forest. ||39||

He entered the difficult path, strewn with stones, swords, and horns, the path filled with dust, the path echoing with the roars of mighty bears, the path terrifying with the roars of lions seated in the depths, the path filled with the cries of monkeys, the path with trees adorned with fallen horse hooves and the sounds of elephants, the path with the shadows of trees covered with the wheels of the monkey army, the path with the roars of lions, the path with the sounds of lionesses drinking water, the path difficult with the broken branches of trees broken by intoxicated elephants. He entered this forest to search for Sanatkumar. ||40-44||

|| Five Groups ||

The army was scattered by the difficult, thorny, and fallen trees, and the land. ||45||

He was increasingly abandoned by his ministers, friends, and others, and he became alone, like a monk. ||46||

He wandered alone, like a village headman, with his bow and arrow, in the great groves, in the caves of the mountains. ||47||

He ran, fearing the sound of Sanatkumar, the hero, amidst the loud roars of the forest elephants and lions. ||48||

He saw his friend there, by the sound of the gushing waterfall, and then, fearing something else, he ran, for love has such speed. ||49||

"The sound of my bondage is like the sound of the river, the elephant, and the lion. You will find him there, for everything is revealed by a glimpse." ||50||

He climbed the branches of the trees, looking everywhere for his friend, and he marked the directions, like a traveler lost on the path. ||51||

He was sorrowful among the ashoka trees, restless among the bakul trees, weak among the sahakar trees, and pale among the mallika trees. ||52||

He was dejected among the karnikar trees, pale among the patala trees, distant among the sindhuvar trees, and trembling among the champka trees. ||53||

He turned away from the Malaya winds, like a villain, and he was startled by the calls of the kokila birds, even though they were singing their fifth song. ||54||

He was restless in the rays of the moon, like a single roarer, the son of a roarer, and he went to the spring. ||55||

|| Four Groups ||

He was scorched by the sun, heated by the dust, with his feet covered in the dust, like a dog, with his feet like lotus petals, spread out. ||56||

He was walking on the path, which was like the ashes of a fire that gives immediate liberation, and he was unaware of the heat of his feet, like a fire pillar. ||57||

He was counting the heat of his body, like an elephant, a mountain walker, with many hot winds and flames of fire. ||58||

He drank the muddy, warm waters of the rivers, and wandered in the summer heat, and he passed it through. || 59 || || Four-part stanza || Like demons, with thunderbolts, and fires with lightning faces, his heart was unshaken, even by those who shook the world. || 60 || With continuous, sharp, cold arrows, he was pierced, but he remained unmoved, even in his mind. || 61 || At every step, forests and rivers, with their uprooted trees, were difficult to cross, but he crossed them effortlessly, like a royal swan. || 62 || Attacking the muddy path, like a boar in play, seeking his friends, he wandered, and he passed even the rainy season. || 63 || || Four-part stanza || With scorching sun on his head, and hot sand on his feet, he endured, like one who has entered the midst of a group of fire arrows. || 64 || In clear water, and among water birds like swans, with an unwearied mind, he asked, "Where are you?" and thus he greeted his friends. || 65 || Passing through the midst of elephants, with their intoxicating scent, seven-leaved trees, and angry tusks, he entered the forest, like an elephant. || 66 || Driven by his friend, the wind, with its lotus-like fragrance, he passed through autumn, wandering like an autumn cloud. || 67 || || Four-part stanza || With the northern wind, like a brother, from the Himalayas, the waters of lakes and rivers were being carried away by the cold. || 68 || Even though the forest fire was burning everywhere, and the water lilies and lotus flowers were being consumed, he passed through the water. || 69 || With the cold-stricken Kiratas, and the forest fire burning, he passed through the winter, with his firm resolve. || 70 || || Three-part stanza || On the withered, old leaves, which bent the knees of the trees, he placed his feet without fear, even though scorpions were hidden there. || 71 || Like a skilled surgeon, with his sharp instruments, he was unmoved by the loud, piercing sounds of the awakened, five-headed, ear-piercing demons. || 72 || With only a taste of the fresh shoots, his stomach was full, and he passed through the cold, with the pain of his friend. || 73 || || Three-part stanza || Thus, wandering through the forest, in search of his son, one year passed for Mahendra Singh. || 74 || Having entered that forest, he stood for a while, and looked in all directions, like a messenger. || 75 || Then, he heard the noise of the karanda, the crane, the swan, and the sarasa birds, without being disturbed. || 76 || He was comforted by the wind, which carried the fragrance of lotuses, and he concluded, from his reasoning, that there must be a lake nearby. || 77 || With tears of joy, he confirmed the meeting with his friend, and he went towards the lake, like a royal swan. || 78 || As he went forward, he heard a song, in the Gandhara scale, sweet, like the sound of a flute, and the sound of a vina, like a deer. || 79 ||

## Chapter 184: The Scattering of Eager Refusal

A beautiful woman adorned with diverse garments stood in the middle of the stage. He saw his dear friend Sanatkumara. ||80||

"Is this a magic trick of some kind, or is it a delusion? Or is this a magic spell, or has it come from my heart?" ||81||

He pondered this until he heard the sweet sound of a song being sung by a certain Vaitalika. ||82||

"O Sanatkumara, the pride of the Kuru dynasty, the ocean of horses, the sun, may your good fortune be everlasting! Victory to you!" ||83||

"Victory to the tree of the embrace of the Vidyaadhara women, the wealth of Vishnu, the two rows of Vaitalika glory!" ||84||

Hearing this, Sanatkumara rose from his seat and went towards the water like an elephant scorched by the summer heat. ||85||

## [Sri Trishatisalaaka Purva - Chapter 6, Verses 74 to 158]

## 22. Five Examples in the Commentary on the Essential Points of Sleep and Meditation

These examples of Paudgala, Moyaga, Dant, Farusaga, and Vadasala-bhanjana are to be known in the context of the arising of sleep due to inertia. ||235||

**Example 1:**

The example of Paudgala is as follows: In a certain village, there was a householder who was very fond of meat. He would eat meat that was cooked, fried, roasted, raw, and mixed with various spices. One day, he was initiated by some elder monks who were very virtuous. While wandering from village to village, he saw a buffalo being tortured by some people who were greedy for its meat. Seeing this, he also developed a desire to eat its meat. This desire did not leave him even when he was eating, reflecting, and performing the final Sutra-pौरुषी, the act of returning, and the Pradoshika-pौरुषी. In fact, he fell asleep with this desire. Then, he woke up from sleep due to inertia. Upon waking up, he went outside the village, into the midst of the buffalo herd, killed another buffalo, and ate its meat. He collected the remaining meat, placed it on his bed, and fell asleep. When he woke up the next morning, he thought, "I had a dream last night." He looked around and saw the meat on his bed. Then, he realized that he had woken up from sleep due to inertia. The Sangha removed the sign and expelled him. ||1||

**Example 2:**

The example of Modaka is as follows: A certain virtuous person was wandering for alms and saw in a certain house a large quantity of fragrant, oily, sweet, and delicious Modakas, which were intoxicating. He looked at them for a long time, but he did not receive any. Then, he fell asleep with a continuous desire for them. When he woke up from sleep due to inertia, he went to that house in the night, broke open the doors, and ate the Modakas at will.

## Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

**185**

A certain man, having been thrown into a pit by a falling object, reached a place of refuge, and having released the falling object from its position, fell asleep. Upon waking, he was questioned by his elders in the same way. Then, while neglecting his duties, the virtuous man saw the sweetmeats in the pit. Then, due to the questioning of his elders, he awoke from his stupor-induced sleep. Similarly, having been given a linga-parāñcīka by the community, he was also expelled. ||2||

The third example is that of the tooth: A certain virtuous man was harassed by an elephant during the day and somehow escaped to a place of refuge. He was consumed by anger towards the elephant and fell asleep at night. He awoke from his stupor-induced sleep. Upon waking, he was said to be endowed with the strength of Keshava, the power of a vajra-bull, and the ability to wield a weapon. Therefore, he broke through the city gates, went inside, killed the elephant, extracted its two teeth, threw them at the entrance of his refuge, and fell asleep. Upon waking, he thought, "This was a dream." Upon seeing the teeth, he realized that he had awakened from his stupor-induced sleep. Similarly, having received a linga, he was expelled by the community. ||3||

The term "faru-sag" refers to a potter, as is well-known. The fourth example is as follows: A certain potter became a monk in a large community. Once, while he was asleep, he awoke from his stupor-induced sleep. Then, just as he used to break lumps of clay in the past, due to that habit, he broke the heads of the virtuous men and left them in a secluded place along with their corpses. Then, some of the remaining virtuous men fled. In the morning, it was clearly understood that he had done all this. He was expelled by the community in the same way. ||4||

The fifth example is that of breaking the branch of a banyan tree: A certain virtuous man, having completed his daily rounds, returned home. He was exhausted from the heat, thirsty, hungry, and seeking shade. While walking along the road, he came under a banyan tree. A low-hanging branch struck his head, causing him great pain. He was consumed by anger and fell asleep. Upon waking from his stupor-induced sleep at night, he went and broke the branch of the banyan tree, threw it at the entrance of his refuge, and fell asleep again. Upon thinking, "I had a dream," and realizing that he had awakened from his stupor-induced sleep, he was expelled by the community after the linga was removed. ||5||

**23. The story of Nandiṣeṇa in the Śrī-Upadeshamālā, which is relevant to the study of causes.**

In the village of Nandi, the son of a Cakracara, named Nandiṣeṇa, was orphaned at a young age. He lived with his maternal uncle. People questioned him, "What kind of karma are you doing with your mother's wealth? Why don't you gather wealth and marry?" He was thus troubled by the people. Then, desiring to leave, he said to his maternal uncle, "I will give you my daughter as a slave." His maternal uncle was pleased by this. When the girl reached puberty, she was presented to him by her uncle. Seeing him, she was disgusted by his misfortune and ugliness. She told her father, "If you give me to him, I will die." Then, he thought, "I will give him my second daughter, but this one doesn't want him." He

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

This is the fruit of the tree of his own sins, thought the worried mind. What is the use of family life? Thinking thus, he was eager to eradicate it. Seeing an Acharya, he heard the Dharma and became a renunciant. He practiced the rituals, accepted the Agamas, and took initiation into the Panchashatika Gachcha. He began to practice the vows. He spent a lot of time enthusiastically, considering himself successful.

One day, in his own assembly, he was praised by Indra, saying, "He is blessed, fulfilled, and has not been surpassed in Dharma even by the gods." A god, who did not believe this, descended and stood at the door of the assembly of the saints. He said, "A weak ascetic is living in the forest." Hearing this, Nandishena, who had just taken the first morsel of his sixth fast, immediately left, inquired about the place and the situation, and entered the forest to get water, medicine, etc. He overcame the obstacles of greed, laziness, and loss of profit with a strong mind, and obtained the desired water and medicine. He went to the place. The god showed him the ascetic, who was dirty, repulsive, and cursed, saying, "Shame on you, bald-headed one! You are only concerned with filling your stomach!" and other harsh words.

Then, I, the unfortunate one, caused sorrow to the mind of this great sage. Thinking, "How will this virtuous one be well?" I washed his body. Nandishena, with sweet words, reassured him, saying, "Be brave, I will make you well. Come, take shelter." He said, "Oh, sinner! You do not know my condition. I cannot even walk a step." Then, he was lifted onto his back and they started to go. The god also cursed him, saying, "Shame on you, wicked one! You are causing a hindrance to my journey!" and other harsh words. The other one, thinking, "How can this great soul be healthy with such a strong negative consequence?" said, "I will now make this wrong deed look good," and continued to walk. Then, the god, with his mind free from the actions of the two, thought, "This is due to Indra's partiality." He withdrew his illusion, revealed his divine form, fell at his feet, and told him the story, saying, "What should I do?" The sage said, "Do your duty as much as you can." He went to his own place. The sage told the saints what had happened.

Later, at the end of his life, he remembered his householder life and thought, "I should be born as a human being and be prosperous." This was the cause. He went to heaven. Then, he was born as the tenth incarnation of Vishnu, named Vasudeva. When he reached youth, he was attracted to beautiful women, and they, too, abandoned their household duties. Then, he went out to conquer the sea, as requested by the citizens, and wandered the earth. With his extraordinary beauty, he was taken to various places by all the people. He married many thousands of daughters of the best Vidhyadhara kings. He attained excessive worldly pleasures. Later, with his relatives, he had a son, Krishna, who was half a chakravarti. He had sons like Pradyumna, etc., and became the patriarch of the Hari dynasty.

## Chapter 188: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**16.**  The wealthy one, devoid of marriage, and his family members had all gone to their homes. I, on the other hand, was left alone in my in-laws' house.

**17.**  With the unbearable pain of the *dohagg* cutting me like a sword, I was longing for liberation, even though I was still hoping for something else.

**18.**  Climbing onto the pyre, I was about to be released from this life.  I was left alone, and she, in a flash, attained the fivefold liberation.

**19.**  My mother and father, along with the family members, arrived together.  The entire group, devoid of the sorrow of the body, was united.

**20.**  The news of her death spread far and wide.  Gangadatta, burdened by the *dohagg*, was deeply ashamed.

**21.**  His father said to him, "My son, don't be disheartened!  This is how it is.  Why are you so sad?  Your sister has become a *bhajjā*."

**22.**  I, on the other hand, was told by a merchant from a distant land that she had been reborn as a *dhūya* (a female Jain ascetic).  He further explained that she had been reborn in a higher realm due to her good deeds.

**23.**  She, with her hands clasped together, ascended to the highest state of bliss.  At the time of her funeral pyre, I, with my grief, was unable to support myself.

**24.**  I, in every land, was afflicted by the unbearable pain of the *dohagg*.  Gangadatta, overwhelmed with sorrow, pondered.

**25.**  "What did I do in my past lives, what heavy karmic debts did I accumulate, that I am now suffering this way, becoming the cause of this woman's misery?"

**26.**  "Those who are wealthy, the sons of kings, and the great rulers, even those who are strong and steadfast, find it difficult to escape the cycle of birth and death.

**27.**  "I, on the path of self-control, am a broken vessel, a *vaggū* (a person who has fallen from the path).  I am a victim of the *dohagg* of women, and even in my dreams, I am plagued by misfortune."

**28.**  "Like a deer caught in a snare, I am trapped by my desires and attachments.  I am consumed by my longing for her.  Alas!  What have I done?"

**29.**  While he was thinking this, his father came to him and said, "My son, control your sorrow.  It is useless.  What is to be done?"

**30.**  "This is the result of past karmic actions, a manifestation of the *pāva* (merit) that has been accumulated over many lifetimes.  There is no other way to attain the ultimate goal."

**31.**  "Come, my son!  Let us go to the *sūri* (a Jain monk), who is a treasure trove of virtues and a refuge from fear.  He is the best medicine for this sorrow.  Let us go and pay our respects to the *nāṇarayaṇa* (the one who possesses knowledge)."

**32.**  He agreed, and they went to the *sūri* with humility.  They bowed down to him, standing firmly on the ground.

I will tell you a story, a parable, about the nature of the path. ||33||
The Suri was asked by Ganga Datta, "O Venerable One, what did you do in the past? What kind of karma did you create?" ||34||
When he was asked this, the Guru said, "Listen carefully." ||35||
"In a city, at the gate of the king, Siri Sehara, there was a merchant. He was very wealthy and had strong attachments." ||36||
"The king had a beautiful palace, adorned with precious jewels. The merchant had five hundred sons." ||37||
"They were all very greedy and envious, and they were always fighting with each other. They were constantly desiring wealth and possessions." ||38||
"They committed many terrible sins, such as stealing, lying, and violence. They also indulged in excessive eating and drinking, and they were very cruel." ||39||
"They suffered from many diseases and illnesses, and they died and were reborn in hell and the animal realm. They experienced much suffering." ||40||
"Because of their karma, they were born as humans in this world. They were still attached to their past desires and actions." ||41||
"They were filled with sorrow and remorse, and they realized the truth of the Dharma. They became awakened and sought refuge in the teachings." ||42||
"They renounced the world and became monks. They lived in forests, villages, and cities, practicing the fourfold path." ||43||
"They spent many years in the monastic life, living a pure and blameless life. They were very disciplined and renounced all worldly possessions." ||44||
"One day, a monk said to them, 'O Great Souls, you have practiced this path for a long time. Now, you should renounce even your food and drink.'" ||45||
"There are four types of renunciation, and you should practice them all. You should renounce your desires, your attachments, your speech, and your thoughts." ||46||
"Renunciation is a difficult path, and there will be many obstacles. But if you are determined, you will succeed." ||47||
"One of the monks was very happy to hear this. He took his food and drink and went to a cave in the mountains." ||48||
"He sat down in meditation, and he was very focused. He renounced all his possessions, and he was free from all attachments." ||49||

With a garland of fragrant, curly locks, and a face as bright as the moon,
With a body as soft as a cloud, and adorned with precious jewels,
With a gait like a graceful elephant, and a voice like a sweet melody,
With a heart full of compassion, and a mind full of wisdom,
With a beautiful form, and a youthful charm,
He was known as the king of the arts, the beloved of the gods.
He bowed to the Siddhas, and went to the city of the Jinas,
His mind filled with devotion, his heart filled with peace.
He was known as Ganga Datta, and he lived a long and happy life,
Surrounded by his family and friends, his heart filled with joy.
The merchant, too, was captivated by his beauty,
And he was filled with admiration for his noble character.
He was a man of great wealth, and he lived a life of luxury,
But he was also a man of great compassion, and he helped the poor and needy.
He was a man of great wisdom, and he taught others the path to liberation.
He was a man of great love, and he was loved by all who knew him.

**A Collection of Verses on the Rejection of the Sick**

Oh, how wretched is my life, how miserable is this human birth!
I am a burden to myself, and a source of ridicule to others.
I am a prisoner of my own body, and I am unable to escape from my suffering.
I am a slave to my desires, and I am unable to find peace.
I am a fool, and I am unable to see the truth.
I am a sinner, and I am unable to find forgiveness.
I am a wretch, and I am unable to find happiness.

I am a burden to my family, and I am a source of sorrow to my friends.
I am a disappointment to my parents, and I am a disgrace to my ancestors.
I am a failure, and I am unable to achieve anything worthwhile.
I am a nobody, and I am unable to make a difference in the world.

I am a sick man, and I am a burden to everyone around me.
I am a nuisance, and I am a source of annoyance to all who know me.
I am a drain on society, and I am a waste of resources.
I am a burden to myself, and I am a source of suffering to others.

I am a sick man, and I am a burden to everyone around me.

Chapter-2: Collection of Examples
23, 63. The story of the Muni named Chitra Sambhuta, included in the Trishatisalaaka Purusha Charitra, about the cause of his birth. In Varanasi, there were two sons of the elephant-lord, named Bhutdatta, who was very wealthy. ||1||
These two, named Chitra Sambhuta, were very affectionate towards each other. They were never separated, bound together like nails and flesh. ||2||
At that time, in Varanasi, there was a king named Shankha. He had a famous minister named Namuchi. ||3||
One day, the king, in a fit of anger, ordered Namuchi to secretly kill Bhutdatta. ||4||
Namuchi secretly said to him, "I will protect you as if you were my own son. You should stay in my house and I will teach your sons." ||5||
Namuchi accepted the elephant-lord's words. People live to survive, and they will do anything to do so. ||6||
Namuchi taught the two Chitra Sambhuta various arts. He was very fond of them and also of the elephant-lord's wife. ||7||
Bhutdatta came to know about this and wanted to kill Namuchi. Who can tolerate a rival in their own wife? ||8||
The elephant-lord's sons came to know about this and sent Namuchi away. They gave him a gift as a reward for saving his life. ||9||
Namuchi then went to Hastinapur. He became the minister of Sanatkumara, the king of Hastinapur. ||10||
Meanwhile, the two Chitra Sambhuta, now young men, came to the earth from somewhere, like the Ashvins. ||11||
They sang sweet songs, making a lot of noise and laughter. They played the vina like the great Narada. ||12||
The Kinnaras were delighted by their playing, which was accompanied by seven distinct musical notes. ||13||
They played the Mrujanga, a drum that makes a loud sound, and danced, holding the skull of a dead elephant, a symbol of mockery. ||14||
They performed the dance of Shiva, the dance of Urvashi, the dance of Rambha, and the dance of Uttara. They performed all the dances that were not known before. ||15||
They were masters of all the arts of music and dance, and their performance was unprecedented. No one's mind could remain unaffected by their performance. ||16||
One day, there was a festival of Madan in the city. The people of the city were enjoying the music and dance. ||17||
The Chitra Sambhuta also went to the festival. The people of the city were attracted by their music and followed them like deer. ||18||
Someone told the king about the elephant-lord's sons. The king was angry because they had attracted everyone with their music and made them forget everything else. ||19||
The king's minister also told the king that the Chitra Sambhuta should not be allowed to enter the city. ||20||
From that day onwards, the Chitra Sambhuta stayed away from Varanasi. One day, there was a great festival of Kaumudi in Varanasi. ||21||
The Chitra Sambhuta, ignoring the king's order and driven by their lust, entered the city like bees entering a lotus flower. ||22||
They watched the festival, their bodies covered in dust. They wandered through the city like thieves, hiding themselves. ||23||

## The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

Like crows with their cawing, they sang a song of sorrow, and then, crossing the river of fear, they decided to go. ||24|| Hearing that sweet song, the young women of the city, like bees attracted to honey, surrounded the two elephants. ||25||  People, wanting to know who they were, pulled at their ears and shouted, "Hey, those are the elephants!" ||26||  The city dwellers, angry, beat them with sticks and stones, and they, like dogs driven from their homes, hung their heads and fled. ||27||  They were attacked by the soldiers, and stumbling at every step, they somehow managed to escape into a deep garden. ||28||  Thinking, "This is a curse, a stain of evil birth. Our skills and beauty, like milk to a snake, have only brought harm. ||29||  We have received kindness with our virtues, but only harm in return. This is what happens when peace is disturbed," a Vetala arose. ||30||  "Our beauty and skills, woven into our bodies, are now a source of misery. Like straw, they should be abandoned." ||31||  Having decided this, they, determined to give up their lives, turned south, as if to meet death face to face. ||32||  They traveled far and saw a mountain where, perched on top, they could see the elephants like monkeys. ||33||  Driven by their desire to see the great sage, they climbed the mountain, and there, on that peak, they saw a mountain of virtues. ||34||  Seeing the sage, standing on the mountaintop like a cloud in the rainy season, their suffering vanished, and they were filled with joy. ||35||  Overwhelmed with happiness, tears of joy streamed down their faces, and they fell at the sage's lotus feet like cows. ||36||  The sage, finishing his meditation, asked, "Who are you, and why have you come here?" They told him their story in detail. ||37||  He said, "Your bodies are indeed decaying, but your evil karma, earned over countless lifetimes, is not. ||38||  If you wish to abandon these bodies, you will receive the fruits of your actions. And that is the ultimate penance, the cause of liberation, heaven, and all else." ||39||  Their minds cleansed by the nectar of his words, they took refuge in the sage's presence, embracing the path of the ascetic. ||40||  Gradually, they became students of the scriptures, for what is there that a determined mind cannot achieve? ||41||  With rigorous penances, starting from the 68th and beyond, they burned away their past karma. ||42||  Wandering from village to village, city to city, they eventually reached Hastinapur. ||43||  There, in the outskirts of the city, they practiced their austere penances. Even in a land of pleasure, those with peaceful minds can find a place for austerity. ||44||  Another sage, known for his fasts, appeared in the city. He entered the city, seeking alms, his body adorned with the marks of an ascetic. ||45||  He wandered through the city, seeking water, and was seen by the minister, Namuchi. ||46||  "This is the elephant's child. He will spread my story," thought the minister, for the wicked are always suspicious. ||47||  "As long as he doesn't reveal my secret to anyone, I will let him live," he thought, and sent him away. ||48||

He was about to strike him, even though he had been a benefactor in the past. For the benefit of the wicked is like milk given to a snake. ||49||

Being beaten with clubs, he moved from his place quickly, like a seed of a plant being uprooted by strong winds. ||50||

Even though he was being beaten with clubs, the Muni remained calm. Even though water is not hot, it boils when heated by fire. ||51||

From his mouth, there emerged a cloud of vapor, like a sudden rain cloud in the sky. ||52||

His radiant energy, like a garland of flames, spread out, covering the sky like a network of lightning. ||53||

Seeing him so enraged, the citizens, filled with fear and curiosity, approached him to appease him. ||54||

King Sanatkumara, knowing what was happening, also arrived there. For wherever fire arises, there the wise should teach. ||55||

The king bowed and said, "O Lord, what is appropriate in this situation? Even a moonstone heated in a furnace does not burn. ||56||

"If this anger is due to the great offense committed by these people, then what happened to the poison that arose from churning the ocean of milk? ||57||

"If it were to happen, it would not last long. And if it were to last long, the result would be different. Anger is like the affection of a wicked person. What are we to say about this?" ||58||

"Nevertheless, O Lord, it is not appropriate for a great being like you to harbor anger. You, like others, are equal in your treatment of benefactors and malefactors." ||59||

Knowing what had happened, Chitra also approached the Muni, trying to console him with sweet words, like a good person trying to calm a fierce tiger. ||60||

His anger subsided, like a raging fire being extinguished by the waters of a cloud, upon hearing Chitra's soothing words. ||61||

Free from the darkness of intense anger, like the moon on the fourteenth night, the great Muni regained his composure in an instant. ||62||

After bowing and seeking forgiveness, the people departed. Chitra, with the Muni's permission, took them away. ||63||

Filled with remorse, they wandered from house to house, realizing that even a small amount of food can lead to great suffering. ||64||

"This body, even though nourished by food, is fleeting. What use is this body, what use is food, to a yogi?" ||65||

Having decided on this, they both renounced all four types of food. ||66||

"Who has defeated the virtuous? Who protects the earth? Who am I?" The king, curious, asked his minister, who replied, "Whoever does not honor the virtuous is a sinner, let alone one who kills them." ||67||

The king, having subdued the sinner like a bandit, brought him before the virtuous. ||68||

"May no one else destroy the virtuous," thought the pure-minded king. He brought the bound sinner to the presence of the virtuous. ||69||

Bowing down, he honored them, like the sun bowing to the earth. The king, the best among kings, honored them both. ||70||

With their left hands holding their garments and their faces covered, they both blessed the king with their right hands. ||71||

"Whoever has offended you, let him suffer the consequences of his actions," said Namuchi, the wise one, to them, referring to King Sanatkumara. ||72||

## Chapter 194: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Cause

**Verse 74:** He should be banished from the city like a Chandala among Chandalas. Even if he is to be killed, he should be released by the king, for the Guru's command is to be respected.

**Verse 75:** She was attended by sixty-four thousand co-wives. She went to pay homage to the Jewel of Women and the Wheel-Bearer, with great joy.

**Verse 76:** The tears that fell from her eyes, as she bowed at the lotus feet of the Muni, fell upon the earth like the moon.

**Verse 77:** The Muni felt the touch of her tears and was immediately filled with a thrill. For Cupid is always seeking an opportunity.

**Verse 78:** Then, having informed the queen in the inner palace, they went out. The Muni, overcome with passion, said, "This is the cause."

**Verse 79:** "If the fruit of my difficult austerities exists, then in my next birth I will be the husband of the Jewel of Women."

**Verse 80:** "Oh, चित्र, what do you desire from the fruit of these liberating austerities? With what precious jewel will you adorn the pedestal of your feet?"

**Verse 81:** "This cause is born of delusion. Let it be abandoned now. Those like you are not deceived by false and evil deeds."

**Verse 82:** Even though he was being dissuaded by चित्र, the Muni still said, "Oh, the desire for the object is stronger than the cause."

**Verse 83:** They both, having been freed from the cycle of birth and death, attained the end of their karmas. They were born in the beautiful celestial palace of Saudharma, as gods.

## Chapter 23: The Story of Draupadi from the Pandava Charitra, as told in the Nidana Dhyana

**Verse 1:** Then, seizing the opportunity, Arjuna asked the Muni at the end of his discourse, "Why are the five Pandavas cursed?"

**Verse 2:** The Muni replied, "They are cursed by the cause they acquired in their previous birth. This has been determined by my investigation."

**Verse 3:** "In the ancient city of Champa, there were three earth-deities, brothers named Soma Deva, Soma Bhuti, and Soma Datta."

**Verse 4:** "They had three wives, born from love, named Naga Shri, Bhut Shri, and Yaksha Shri."

**Verse 5:** "They lived together in harmony, with the understanding that they would share their wives in turn, all living in the same house."

**Verse 6:** "When it was Naga Shri's turn to be with her husband, she prepared a variety of dishes, full of different flavors."

**Verse 7:** "She made a bitter, gourd-like dish, seasoned with many ingredients. She was unaware that it was poisonous, and it was left on the stove for a long time."

**Verse 8:** "She did not throw it away, even though it was made with many expensive ingredients, out of stinginess. She simply hid it in a secluded place."

**Verse 9:** "She then happily fed her husband and brothers-in-law with various other delicious dishes. They soon left."

**Verse 10:** "At that time, a great sage named Dharma Ghosha lived in the royal garden called Subhumi Bhaga."

**Verse 11:** "His disciple, Dharma Ruchi, was observing a fast for a month. He went to Naga Shri, like a Kirata to a Kalpa tree."

**Verse 12

They, smelling that fragrance, said this out of compassion, etc. "If you eat this, dear one, you will immediately die." ||14||

"On a clean platform, place the mango, purify it somewhere." With this command from his teacher, he went outside the city. ||15||

When a drop fell from it, somehow, there, from a vessel, the sage saw ants dying, stuck to it. ||16||

He thought, "If this drop, even though small, is a killer of living beings, then what will all of it do?" ||17||

"It is better for me to die alone, than for millions of beings to die." Thinking this, with his hair standing on end, he himself ate it. ||18||

Considering the direct perception of the Siddhas, with a mind filled with the sweetness of meditation, he, having attained the fulfillment of all purposes, gave up his life. ||19||

To know why there is delay from the desire for external dharma, the teacher, Shri Dharmaghosha, then instructed the other sages. ||20||

Seeing that one outside, they, taking the dust from his feet, etc., reported everything to their teacher. ||21||

Knowing, as it was, by the use of supra-sensory knowledge, they also narrated the story of Nagashri to all the sages. ||22||

Knowing somehow, people, by word of mouth, told the story of the evil deeds of Somadeva and other Brahmanas. ||23||

The Brahmanas, angered by lust, drove her out of her house. Being condemned by the people, she wandered everywhere. ||24||

She suffered from sixteen diseases, such as cough, shortness of breath, fever, tremors, leprosy, etc., and experienced the torment of hell right here. ||25||

Tormented by hunger, thirst, and pain, condemned everywhere, she wandered in misery, and after death, she reached the sixth hell. ||26||

From there, she was born as a fish, and went to the seventh hell. Again, attaining the form of a fish, she went to that very hell. ||27||

Thus, she experienced all the hells twice. She was born in various forms, such as earth, etc., and was greatly tormented. ||28||

Then, due to the lightness of her karma, she was born as a beautiful girl in Champa. She was the daughter of Sagardatta, and was named Subhadra. ||29||

There, Jinadatta was her son, and Sagara was her brother. Her father, seeing the beautiful girl in his house, ||30||

thinking, "She is suitable for my son," went to her father with his relatives and asked for her. ||31||

He said, "She is very dear to me, I cannot live without her. Let her be my daughter-in-law, Sagara is your son." ||32||

"I will consult my daughter," said Jinadatta and went home. He remained silent, accepting the proposal of Sagara. ||33||

Her father thought, "What is not forbidden is permitted," and agreed to his son's marriage to Sagardatta. ||34||

A wonderful wedding ceremony took place. They spent the night together in the bridal chamber. ||35||

Due to her past karma, Sagara, touching her, felt as if he was touching burning coals. He stayed there for a while. ||36||

When she was fast asleep, he left and went home. When she woke up from sleep, she cried loudly, not seeing her beloved. ||37||

Then, Subhadra, instructed

## Chapter 196: The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

She went and told Subhadra, who immediately informed her beloved. Her father himself also reproached his son-in-law. 

He said to his son, "My dear, this is not right what you have done. Go back now, do not disobey my words."

"Even if the ocean were to be set on fire, I would rather jump into it," he said, "but I will never go to her house, father."

Sagaradatta heard this from within his house. He went home and told the disheartened girl, "My dear, Sagar has completely renounced you. Do not be sad, another husband will be found for you."

She saw a mendicant, wearing only a loincloth, surrounded by flies, standing by the window. 

She called him, bathed him with fragrant water, anointed him with sandalwood, and dressed him in divine garments. 

She said, "This girl, my daughter, has been given to you. Enjoy my prosperous Lakshmi, live happily with her."

He was told this and entered the house with her at night. He considered the touch of her body like the heat of fire to himself. 

He suddenly got up, took his own clothes, and fled. Seeing her weeping, her father said, "My dear, this is the result of your previous actions, not any other reason. Now, stay here in my house, with a peaceful mind, and accept the gifts given to you."

She stayed there, devoted to Dharma. The next day, some cowherdesses came to her house. 

She received them with pure food and drink, and with devotion, she listened to Dharma from their mouths. She renounced the world and took vows. 

She performed austerities, such as the fourth, sixth, and eighth, and lived with the Aryikas. 

One day, the Aryikas said to her, "We will build a shelter for you. There is a beautiful garden with a good location, bathed in sunlight."

She replied to them, "It is not appropriate for a virtuous woman to have a shelter outside the house."

Ignoring their words, she went into the forest. As she began to expose herself to the sun, she saw a woman named Devadatta, a courtesan, who had come there. 

Seeing her, she thought, "This is the cause. I will become like the wife of the five senses through this austerity."

She thought, "I will maintain bodily purity and other virtues, moment by moment. The Aryikas will try to stop me, but I will not heed them."

She thought, "I was once highly respected by the Aryikas. Now they despise me, a mendicant."

Thinking this, she left and lived in a different place. She observed her vows for a long time, living freely.

. [From Sri Pandavacharitra, verses 324 to 386] 24. The detailed account of Marudevi, the mother, as mentioned in the Trishatishalaka Purushacharitra, is a meditation on love.
Even though she was humble, the king of the Bharatas was humble.  He came to pay his respects to Marudevi in the morning. ||1||  With tears of sorrow caused by the separation from her son, her lotus eyes were filled with blue. ||2||
The eldest grandson bowed to her, "O Goddess! I bow to your lotus feet."  He himself declared this, Bharata bowed to her. ||3|| (couplet) Marudevi, the mistress, also gave her blessings to Bharata.  She spoke with a heart full of sorrow, like a pure mountain. ||4||  "I, the earth, the people, the Lakshmi, leaving you like a blade of grass, I went alone, O Marudevi, my son! ||5||  Where is the shade of the sun and moon, the umbrella, on his head?  Where is the heat of the sun, which burns the whole body? ||6||  Where are the chariots with smooth movement, the chariots with elephants, etc.?  Where is the walking of the son, which is suitable for a traveler? ||7||  Where are the beautiful chamaras, thrown by the wives of the guards?  Where is the trouble caused by mosquitoes and other insects to my son now? ||8||  Where is the food and drink, brought by the gods, which he used to enjoy?  Where is the food of alms, or his food, now? ||9||  Where is the great throne, adorned with jewels, his seat?  Where is the freedom from a seat, like a swordsman, for my son now? ||10||  Where is the protection of the city, protected by the guards and the self-protection?  Where is the son's dwelling, in the forest, where lions, tigers, and dogs roam? ||11||  Where is the singing of the divine women, the nectar for the ears?  Where are the sounds of the mad drums, the ear-piercing sounds, for the son? ||12||  Alas! How painful! How painful, that my son is suffering in penance.  Like a lotus petal, he is soft, he endures the flow of water. ||13||  He endures the hardship of the snowfall in the Himalayas.  He goes continuously, like a jasmine creeper in the forest. ||14||  He experiences the intense heat of the sun's rays.  He is like a tree in the desert. ||15||  Thus, at all times, he is a forest dweller, without shelter.  He is alone, like a common man, my son is a source of sorrow for me. ||16||  Seeing her son, who is overwhelmed with sorrow, she speaks, as if to her own eyes.  She always says, "Alas! I am also suffering because of you." ||17||  Thus, the goddess, Marudevi, overwhelmed with sorrow, with folded hands.  The king of the earth, the lord of the earth, spoke to her. ||18||  "O Goddess! You are the mother of the one who is like the diamond

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

While wandering in the forest, the Lord, even though affected by the curse, did not intend to cause any harm, as if made of stone. ||21||

The unbearable hardships of hunger, thirst, and scorching heat, are indeed the helpers of the father, the destroyer of karma. ||22||

If you do not believe my words, you will believe them nonetheless. The father will not be long in coming, with the news of the festival of the Kevala. ||23||

Meanwhile, the king, with a cane in his hand, was approached by two men named Yamaka and Shamaka. ||24||

Prostrating himself, Yamaka informed the Lord of Bharata: "By good fortune, today you are blessed with this auspicious news." ||25||

"In the ancient city of Purimatala, in the forest of Shakatana, the Kevala was born at the beginning of the age." ||26||

Prostrating himself, Shamaka also announced in a loud voice: "Now, in the armory, the jewel of the wheel has been born." ||27||

The king pondered for a moment, "To whom should I offer the first worship of this newly born Kevala, who is also the wheel?" ||28||

"Where is the giver of universal peace, and where is the wheel, the destroyer of life?" Reflecting thus, he decided to worship his own family first. ||29||

After giving them appropriate and abundant gifts, the king dismissed them and addressed Marudevi: "O Goddess, you are always the embodiment of compassion. My son is a solitary seeker of alms, and he is the object of my sorrow." ||30||

"He who is the lord of the three worlds, is now the son of his own son. See his prosperity," he said, and made her mount the elephant. ||31||

Adorned with gold, diamonds, and rubies, with horses, elephants, chariots, and statues of beauty, he set out. ||33||

With armies, and with arches formed by the masses of jewels and ornaments, the king, even from a distance, saw the jeweled banner ahead. ||34||

He then addressed Marudevi: "O Goddess, the Lord's procession is made by the gods. It is heard that the gods are celebrating the birth of the Lord's lotus feet." ||35||

"The deep, sweet, divine sound of the drums, like a bard's music, fills the heart with joy." ||37||

"The sound of the anklets of the celestial beings, who are worshipping the Lord's lotus feet, is like the sound of a forest of trees, and it is a guest in our ears." ||38||

"The roar of the celestial beings, who are overjoyed at the sight of the Lord, is like the thunder of the clouds." ||39||

"This is the song of the Gandharvas, purified by the nectar of the Lord's words. Today, we will enjoy the nectar of the Lord's words, like the nectar of flowers." ||40||

Hearing this, Marudevi was overwhelmed with joy, and her eyes, like blue lotuses, were filled with tears of happiness. ||41||

She saw the fortune of the Tirthankara, which was overflowing with the love of her son. Seeing this, she became absorbed in it. ||42||

She ascended the chariot, and in an unprecedented sequence of actions, her eight karmas were destroyed, and she attained the knowledge of the Kevala. ||43||

Riding on the back of an elephant, Marudevi, the queen, attained the

24. In the Sri Parivishta Parva, the lament of Sunanda's affection for Vajra. And Vajra was there, gradually becoming a Trihayana. At that time, the Sadhus like Dhanagiri etc. came there. ||1|| Dhanagiri will come, I will take my son. Thinking thus, Sunanda rejoiced at their arrival. ||2|| Sunanda also requested her son from the great sages. They did not agree and replied as follows. ||3|| This child was given to us by you without being asked, O beautiful one. Who wants to take back what has been given like vomit? ||4|| Ownership is lost in things given for play. Do not ask for your son, he has been made another's by you. ||5|| Thus, both sides were arguing loudly. The people said that the king would decide this dispute. ||6|| Then Sunanda, along with the people, went to the king's court. The monks also went with the assembly. ||7|| Sunanda sat on the left of the king, and the honorable assembly sat in their respective places on the right. ||8|| After hearing the arguments of both sides, the king replied. The child should belong to the one who called him. ||9|| Both parties agreed to this decision. Then the question arose, who should call the son first? ||10|| The citizens said that the child should be called by the woman who raised him. The love that has been nurtured for a long time cannot be violated. ||11|| The mother should call him first, this is a difficult task. A woman is also compassionate, this is not otherwise. ||12|| Then Sunanda showed the child many toys and various kinds of food. ||13|| These are elephants, these are horses, these are birds, these are chariots. They have been brought for your play, take them, child! ||14|| Laddoos, mandakas, grapes, sugar, and other things. Whatever you want is here, take it, child! ||15|| I will be your life, I will be your support in all aspects. Live long, rejoice long, quickly please Sunanda. ||16|| My god, my son, my soul, my life. You are everything to me, revive me with your embrace. ||17|| Do not make me look strange, child! In front of these people. My heart will break in two like a ripe gourd. ||18|| Come, child, come to my lap! I want to hold you close. I cannot get the comfort of your stay in my womb, even for a moment. ||19|| Thus, with toys, food, and sweet words, Sunanda's son did not even turn his mind towards Sunanda. ||20|| No man can be free from the debt of his mother's kindness. Knowing this, the wise Vajra thought. ||21|| If I ignore the assembly and accept my mother's kindness, then my worldly life will be very long. ||22|| This blessed mother of mine will perform a small act of renunciation. I will ignore this momentary pain. ||23|| Seeing this clearly, Vajra, with his firm resolve, did not move from his position, even in his mind, like a statue. ||24||

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

King, O Sunanda! You are a creeping infant. Like a snake, you are being consumed by fire, and you do not know your mother. ||25||

Then, the king, Dhanagiri, having found the opportunity, said these measured words, throwing away his dust-remover. ||26||

If you are truly dedicated to the vow, if you are a knower of the truth yourself, then take this dust-remover, the banner of Dharma, from me, O sinless one! ||27||

Immediately, like a thunderbolt, Vajra, with his raised hand, quickly ran towards Dhanagiri, his feet making a loud thudding sound. ||28||

Going to his father's embrace, and mounting it, with a pure mind, he took the dust-remover, as easily as a lotus from a pond. ||29||

With his hand and lotus-like palm, he lifted the dust-remover. It shone like a cluster of hair, with the glory of the teachings. ||30||

With a smile that revealed his teeth, like the white buds of a jasmine flower, he did not look away from the dust-remover, even in his mind. ||31||

As the day passed, like a lotus that quickly wilts, Sunanda, with her chin resting on her hand, thought this way. ||32||

My brother has renounced the world, my husband has renounced the world, and now my son will also renounce the world. Therefore, I will also renounce the world. ||33||

I have no brother, no husband, and no son now. Therefore, for me too, renunciation is better than living in a house. ||34||

Having decided this for herself, Sunanda went to her house. Vajra, taking the dust-remover, and the monks also went to their dwelling. ||35||

The one who desired the vow did not drink milk, and Vajra, until then, was also not weaned. Thus, the Acharya, having renounced the world, again made her a renunciant. ||36||

With the special fortune that arose, and with the sight of the world's detachment, Sunanda also renounced the world, in the presence of the Acharya of that order. ||37||

[Sri Parishishtaparva, verses 100 to 136] 24. The story of the mother of the Arhat, in the affectionate meditation of the Sri Uttaraadhyayana Sutra. ||

Tagara Nagari, there lived a man named Arihamitta, and near him lived a merchant named Datta, who, with his wife Bhadda and son, had taken the vow of an Arhat. He did not make his son beg for alms, he raised him with the first milk and with whatever he desired. He was delicate, unable to bear hardship, and did not speak much. He was patient, and after a few days, he would go out for alms. He was delicate-bodied, and in the summer, he would get hot in the sun and would sweat. He was overcome by the heat, and he saw a merchant woman standing in the shade. He was very delicate-bodied, and he was overcome by the heat, so he went and sat down there. He was asked, "What are you seeking?" "Alms," he said. She gave him some mangoes. He was asked, "What Dharma do you practice?" He said, "I practice the Dharma of non-violence." She said, "Then eat the mangoes with me." He, being overcome by the heat, and wanting to eat, accepted the mangoes. He was then taken by the merchants, and he was not seen again.

Shameful, then the Vidyunmali deva, playing the drum with those two singing, moved in front of the Tridivaukasas. At that time, Nagila, while going on a heavenly journey, saw Vidyunmali, his friend from a previous birth, at a distance. Then he was addressed by the heavenly being: "Bhadral, do you know me?" He said, "Tejasvin, I know you, who are you?" Then, after performing a Shraddha ritual, he told him about his and his previous birth's form, the divine form he had attained through that Dharma. Hearing this, he said, "Oh friend, what should I do?" Achyutasura said, "Friend, make a statue of Vibhor Murti, the embodiment of Bhavasadho, who is in the state of Kayotsarga in the Chitra Griha with a household life. Your Bodhi bija will sprout." Having heard this, he went home and saw the statue of Shri Vira. Then the deva went to the Himavat mountain, cut down a Gosirsha Chandana tree, and made a statue with ornaments as he had seen it. 25. In the Kamadhyana, Shri Trishatishalaka Purushacharitra, Ravana, due to grief, was also suffering from the pain of being separated from Vaidehi. Like a Falachya, he lay on his bed, fallen. 1. Then Mandodari Devi went to him and said, "How are you, my lord? You are standing like a lifeless person." 2. Ravana also said, "Due to the fever of separation from Vaidehi, I am unable to move, speak, or even look." 3. "If you are alive, then, O proud one, abandon your pride and go and bring back Vaidehi, so that she may be with me." 4. "I do not desire any other woman, I will never eat with another. I have a strong vow, witnessed by my Guru." 5. "The noble lady, suffering from the pain of her husband, went to the Devaramano garden and spoke to Sita." 6. "This is Mandodari, the queen of Dasanana. I will become your servant, serve the ten-headed one." 7. "Sita, you are blessed, you are served by him constantly. He is a trustworthy, fearless, and powerful husband." 8. "Even today, if you get Dasanana, what will you gain from a husband like Rama, who is a mere mortal, a tapasvi?" 9. "Sita angrily said, "Where is the lion, where is the jackal? Where is the Garuda, where is the crow? Where is Rama, where is your husband?" 10. "It is appropriate for you to be a couple, you and that sinner. He is lustful towards other women, and she is a messenger for him." 11. "You are not even fit to be seen, let alone spoken to. Go away from here, leave my sight." 12. "Ravana also went there and said, "Why are you angry, Sita? Mandodari is your servant." 13. "I am also your servant, be merciful to me, Devi. Janaki, you are pleasing to this people, even if you don't look at them." 14. "Sita turned her face away and said, "You are seen with the eyes of death, taking me away from Rama's house." 15. "Shame on you, you who have no hope, who ask for what is not asked for. How long will you live

Chapter: - 2 Collection of Examples
Even though he was being attacked, Dasanana said again and again, "Alas, the state of desire is stronger." ||17|| In the meantime, unable to see Sita who was immersed in sorrow, he submerged himself in the western salt ocean, the abode of the treasures. ||18|| A terrible night began, and Ravana, with a terrible mind, began to inflict afflictions on Sita, blinded by anger and desire. ||19|| Great owls hooted, ferrets barked, wolves howled strangely, and other warriors fought each other. ||20|| Tigers with short tails roared, snakes with hoods hissed, and ghosts, spirits, and goblins, with their sharp claws, ||21|| danced wildly, like the attendants of Yama, and approached Sita, terrifying. ||22|| 

|| Three Special Points || 

Thinking of the five supreme beings in her mind, Sita remained fearless, and did not bow to Dasanana. ||23|| [Sri Trishatisalaaka Purva - 7 Sloka - 126 to 148] 26. In Kalushadhyana, the Sri Upadeshamala, the story of the Peetha - Maha Peetha is mentioned in the section on the things to be avoided and the things to be adopted. 

In Mahavideha, the householder, the equivalent of a chakravarti, the teacher Vairanabha, lived with his younger brothers, Bahu, Subahu, Peetha, and Maha Peetha, who were the holders of the eleven limbs. There, Bahu, due to the weakening of his body, became a Vaiavritta of the Panchashatika Gachcha. Subahu, due to his suffering from being beaten, found pleasure in it, and the other two were engaged in their studies. On another occasion, while praising their qualities, the teacher praised Bahu and Subahu, saying, "You two are blessed and have achieved your purpose." From then on, they did not give up their royal nature, and they were praised for their diligence in their own work, but not for their devotion to their studies. This caused resentment in the minds of the other two towards their teacher. From that time onwards, they did not discuss this matter with anyone, and after a long time, they were born as a woman named Brahmi Sundari, and Vairanabha, Bahu, and Subahu were born as Rishabhadeva, Bharata, and Bahubali respectively. 26. In Kalushadhyana, the Sri Upadeshamala, the story of the sage who lived in the lion's cave is mentioned in the section on the things to be avoided and the things to be adopted. 

203
In Pataliputra, the disciples of Aryasambhuta Vijaya Acharya, on the first day of the rainy season, received their teachers who had demonstrated their strength and fortitude. One of them lived in a lion's cave for four months without eating, another lived near a snake's hole, another lived on a well platform, and Sthulabhadra lived in the house of a wealthy woman who was a householder, and ate with her. 

After receiving their teachers, they went to their respective places. The lion and the snake were pacified. The wealth of the woman was almost completely destroyed by thieves, and thinking that this was due to Sthulabhadra, various people harassed him. Seeing his unwavering nature, they were disappointed and fell at his feet. Knowing their intentions, he explained the Dharma to them. The woman became a Shravaka, and she gave up her lawsuit and accepted the Dharma.

**The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager**

The vow of renunciation of the world. The virtuous ones who had come together after the completion of the acceptance, were told by the Guru in the presence of the remaining virtuous ones, "Leave behind the gross-blessed one, the others are the doers of difficult deeds." The gross-blessed one arrived, and upon seeing him, they were encouraged by the Guru, saying, "He is the doer of difficult deeds." Then, taking up his former glory, he was praised by the Guru as the doer of easy deeds. "Oh, how these people are obsessed with worldly conduct!" Thus, the minds of the others were filled with defilement. Then, again, gathering together, in another year, when the virtuous ones were about to accept the acceptance in the same place, the one who lived in the lion's cave said, "I will stay for the four months of fasting in the treasury-house of the sister of the treasury." The Guru prevented him, saying, "It is not proper for you to do this." Going against his words, he went to that house. Seeing him, she, knowing his thoughts, recognized that he had come out of envy towards the gross-blessed one, and allowed him to stay. Then, thinking, "I will show him the unbearable fruit of his qualities," she, with her body worn out by night-long discussions, began to torment him with the attacks of the maddening urges of lust, with the confusion of body and speech. Then, with a wavering mind, he, forgetting his state of self-awareness, begged her. She said, "We do not become the wives of the destitute." He thought, "It is heard in the northern path that there is a king who gives a blanket worth a lakh to the virtuous ones. I will go there." He went there, obtained the blanket, and came back and offered it to her. She said, "Look, it is lying there in the storehouse." He said, "Did you destroy it?" She said, "Do you know this?" He said, "What is there to know?" She said, "If that is so, then why does one with a body full of impurities desire contact with me, who am nothing but a treasure of invaluable qualities?" Then, the result of his actions came back to him. "Oh, I am constantly falling into the abyss of existence, and I am being rescued," he thought, and said, "O virtuous one, wise in the virtuous! I desire your instruction. I have turned away from this difficult resolve." She said, "This is appropriate for one like you." Then, he went to the Guru, was given advice, performed penance, and returned to the essence of his being.

**27. The Story of Duryodhana in the Kalha-Dhyana of the Trishatisalaaka Purushacharitra**

Rukmini's house, the sage Ati-Mukta Rishi arrived. Seeing him, Satyabhama also came there quickly. ||1||

Rukmini asked the sage, "Will I have a son or not? Will my son be equal to Krishna?" Having said this, he departed. ||2||

Satyabhama, believing the sage's words to be true, said to Rukmini, "My son will be equal to Krishna." ||3||

Rukmini said, "The sage's words are not true, they are deceitful." While they were arguing like this, Krishna came to them. ||4||

Then, King Duryodhana, his brother, came there. He said to Bhama, "My son will be your son-in-law." ||5||

Rukmini also said to him, "I will give my daughter to your son."

## Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

**205**

**27.** The example of Narada is shown in the commentary of the *Aavashyakahar* by Shri Bhadriya, in the context of the meditation on conflict.  _The son of Nishadha, the son of Baldeva, named Sagarachanda, was very handsome and beloved by all.  There was a beautiful woman named Kamalamela, who was the wife of another king, and she was desired by the son of Uggase, named Nabhasena.  Narada came to Sagarachanda's house, was welcomed, and asked him, "O Blessed One, have you seen anything extraordinary?"  Sagarachanda replied, "Yes, I have seen something extraordinary.  Where?"  Narada said, "Right here in Varavaya, the beautiful Kamalamela is in the house.  Who gave her to you?"  Sagarachanda replied, "Yes, but how can I be united with her?"  Narada said, "I don't know."  Sagarachanda, hearing this, could not find peace, neither in sitting nor in lying down.  He kept thinking about Kamalamela, and he ate while writing her name on a leaf.  Narada went to Kamalamela and asked her, "Have you seen anything extraordinary?"  She replied, "I have seen two extraordinary things.  Sagarachanda is very handsome, and Nabhasena is very ugly.  Sagarachanda is infatuated with Nabhasena, and Nabhasena is repulsed by Sagarachanda.  Narada has brought them together, and they are about to go together, as they wish."  Sagarachanda's mother and other relatives were very worried, thinking that he would die.  They came to see him, and they found him weeping.  They comforted him, and they covered his eyes with their hands.  Sagarachanda said, "Kamalamela!"  They said, "We are not Kamalamela."  Sagarachanda said, "Yes, you are.  You are my pure lotus-petal-like Kamalamela."  Then, those relatives took him to the temple, and he was relieved.  He thought, "Oh, I have been relieved of my suffering.  Now, what can I do to repay this favor?"  He decided to follow the path of righteousness, and he went to Nabhasena's house.  On the day of Nabhasena's wedding, Sagarachanda and his relatives went to the garden.  Narada gave them a chariot, and they went to the garden.  They were playing there.  The others did not see Kamalamela.  They saw her on the way to the garden.  She was very beautiful.  Narayana, the strong one, came out, and he fell at her feet.  She gave him to Sagarachanda, and Nabhasena forgave him.  Here, Sagarachanda's belief that Kamalamela was his wife is a delusion, and his statement, "I am not Kamalamela," is a delusion.

**28.** The battle between the king of Koonika and Chetaka, as described in the *Trishatishalaka Purushacharitra*, in the context of the meditation on war.  Then, mounted on their chariots, adorned with divine earrings, wearing divine garments, they appeared like celestial beings.  ||1||  They were both extremely beautiful, and they were both very proud.  Seeing them, Padmavati thought that her womanhood was insignificant compared to them.  ||2||  Without divine necklaces, earrings, and garments, a kingdom is like a face without eyes.  ||3||  Then, both of them, with their chariots, were ready to fight.

## Chapter 206: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Due to his excessive greed, the king thought of asking for the necklace and other things.  A woman's capture is more important than even the capture of a fort. ||6||

On another day, the king of the earth, Hallavihalla, requested the necklace and other four things from the one who had abandoned his brotherly love. ||7||

"This is a valid order," they said, accepting it and went home.  "Let us consult with each other, both of us are wise." ||8||

"This intention is not good, what is the purpose of this?  Let us go elsewhere, there is only misfortune everywhere." ||9||

Having decided this, they comforted the two kings, the pair of Sechanak, and taking the necklace and other things, they went to Vaishali at night. ||10||

The grandfather and Chetak, surrounding them, came.  They saw them with love and acceptance, like a prince. ||11||

Knowing that they had gone to Vaishali, the cunning one, like a cheated rogue, with his chin resting on his hand, thought. ||12||

"I have neither elephants nor jewels, nor are they my brothers.  I am born to be deprived of both, due to the dominance of women." ||13||

"If I do not bring them back in this time of distress, what is the difference between me and a merchant who endures defeat?" ||14||

Then, he instructed a messenger, Chetak, to go to Vaishali.  "Go, find my brothers and bring back the jewels they have taken." ||15||

The messenger went to the city of Vaishali and stood before Chetak.  He bowed to Chetak, sat down, and spoke politely. ||16||

"They have come here, with jewels, elephants, and other things.  Hand over the princes, Hallavihalla and Halla, to Kunika." ||17||

"If you do not hand them over, you will face the downfall of your kingdom.  You should not destroy the temple for the sake of a nail." ||18||

Chetak said, "No one else has come here seeking refuge, let alone these two nephews, who are dear to me like my own sons." ||19||

The messenger said, "You are a refuge, but if you do not hand them over, kill them and take their jewels and give them to the king, my master." ||20||

Chetak said, "This dharma is the same for both the king and the beggar.  No one should ever give another's wealth to someone else." ||21||

"I will not take anything from them, neither by force nor by persuasion.  My nephews are worthy of dharma, and especially of giving." ||22||

The messenger came to Champa and told Chetak's words to his master.  He was distressed, as if a fire of anger was burning within him. ||23||

Kunika, at that time, was roaring like a lion, like a victorious elephant.  The mighty ones do not tolerate insults. ||24||

The king's army, with extraordinary strength, was ready to move immediately, all together. ||25||

The princes, Kala and others, ten in number, with great strength, stood in front, ready for a full-scale battle. ||26||

There were three thousand elephants, as many horses, as many chariots, and three crore foot soldiers. ||27||

This was the strength of each of the ten princes.  Kunika's power exceeded even this. ||28||

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples

Chetak, surrounded by eighteen kings with crowns, attacked with an immense army.  || 30 ||  There were thousands of chariots and horses, and millions of elephants and foot soldiers. || 31 ||  Each of the eighteen kings had an army of equal size, and Chetak's army was also of equal size. || 32 ||  Going to the border of his own country, Chetak, with that army, formed a difficult-to-break ocean formation with his warriors. || 33 ||  The king of Champa also went there with his army, of the same size as mentioned before, and formed an impenetrable Garuda formation with his army. || 34 ||  There were terrible battles between the two armies. Thousands were struck, their bellies filled with cries. || 35 ||  The two armies, with their white elephants like pillars of fame, clashed. || 36 ||  In the army of Kurnika, the valiant Kumar, the leader of the army, was the first to fight against Chetak's army. || 37 ||  The Sadi fought with the Sadi, the Nishad with the Nishad, the charioteer with the charioteer, and the warrior with the warrior in the two armies. || 38 ||  With the elephants, horses, and spears falling, the earth became like a mountain range. || 39 ||  With the warriors broken and killed in battle, rivers of blood flowed like rivers and oceans. || 40 ||  In the battle, the elephants, with their shining swords, appeared like a forest of sword leaves. || 41 ||  The warriors, with their hands cut by swords, filled the battlefield with their bravery. || 42 ||  The soldiers, with their heads struck by the edge of the sword, fell, as if they were being ordered to fight by their own leaders. || 43 ||  Thus, Kal, like a ship in the ocean, entered the ocean formation and reached Chetak's side. || 44 ||  Seeing Kal, who was coming like time itself, Chetak thought, "This one, like a thunderbolt, cannot be stopped by anyone." || 45 ||  "I will immediately subdue this mountain of the ocean of battle, even if it is a divine bird." || 46 ||  Thus, Chetak, with his divine weapon, which was the destroyer of the enemy's life and wealth, attacked Kal and brought him to the fifth stage. || 47 ||  Then, like the shining sun setting, the army of Champa was enveloped in darkness. || 48 ||  The army of Champa, abandoning the battle, remained awake. For how could sleep come to them, like a wife who has been wronged? || 49 ||  The warriors of Chetak's army, making the victory sound of the drums, made the night very loud. || 50 ||  The next day, Chetak, who was appointed as the commander-in-chief by the king of Champa, killed Mahakal, like time itself. || 51 ||  He killed eight other commanders, the sons of the श्रेणिक, one by one, each day, as before. || 52 ||  When ten of his brothers, including Kal, were killed by Chetak, the king of Champa thought, "Even a single leaf, by the grace of God, can conquer. For Chetak cannot be defeated by mortals, even if they are millions in number." || 54 ||

## Chapter 208: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

"Alas, how foolish I was to not know the power of Chetaka!  I myself have brought about the death of my ten brothers, the Devabhas. " (55)

"The fate that befell them will also be mine.  It is not fitting for me to retreat after witnessing the death of my brothers." (56)

"I will worship the Deities and, by their power, conquer the enemy.  Divine power is indeed bound by divine power." (57)

"Having decided on this strategy and placing the Deities in my heart, the king, the son of Srenika, remained steadfast in his devotion." (58)

"Bound by their past lives and their austerities, Sakra and the lord of the Yakshas approached him at that time." (59)

"The lord of the gods and the lord of the Asuras said, 'What do you desire?'" (60)

"He replied, 'If you are pleased, let Chetaka be slain.'" (61)

"Sakra spoke again, 'Ask for something else.  Chetaka is my co-religionist; I will never kill him.'" (62)

"However, I will protect your body, O king!  So that you may not be defeated by him.'  He said, 'So be it.'" (63)

"The lord of the Yakshas then thought to make a great stone-studded mace and another chariot-breaking mace for victory." (64)

"The first would be like a stone, even a fallen crab would be crushed by it.  The mace would also be very powerful." (65)

"The second, the chariot-breaking mace, would spin without a wheel, crushing the enemy army on all sides in battle." (66)

"The lord of the gods, the lord of the Asuras, and the king, the Kūṇika, then fought along with Chetaka's army." (67)

"The grandson of Nagarathin, the guardian of the twelve vows, the one with perfect vision, the six-meal eater, always detached from worldly desires, the king, who, despite being a six-meal eater, became an eighth-meal eater due to the king's request, was greatly desired by the king Chetaka." (68)

"In the battle, even in the face of such a formidable chariot-breaking mace, the commander named Varuna, the true warrior, entered the fray." (69)

"(With three distinguishing features) He, the commander of the army of the king of Champa, facing the enemy in battle, spread out his great chariot with unbearable force." (70)

"The two, facing each other, stood firm, eager for battle, radiating the brilliance of the sun, fierce and terrible." (71)

"The lord of the Yakshas, the commander of the army of the king of Champa, challenged Varuna in battle, shouting, 'Strike, strike!' to the one standing before him." (72)

I forgive all living beings, may all forgive me. My friendship is with all beings, I have no enmity with anyone. ||79||
Nothing is mine, nor am I anyone's. I renounce even the sense of "mine" that I have created. ||80||
How many, how many, I, the foolish one, have indulged in sinful acts. Let that be false, my wrongdoing, I am now free from attachment. ||81||
Whatever evil deeds I have done in the states of godhood, humanity, animalhood, and hell, may the glorious hero, the Arhat, be my refuge. ||82||
Having performed such worship, he renounced the fourfold [food, etc.] and then, with a focused mind, he bowed down. ||83||
Then, a friend of Varuna, a false seer, came out from outside and, approaching Varuna, said this. ||84||
Friend! I am also now bought by your kindness. I have taken refuge in the meditation that you have practiced, even though I did not know it. ||85||
He who is devoted to bowing down, devoted to the Dharma and meditation, attained samadhi and, in the state of samadhi, Varuna passed away. ||86||
In that celestial plane, called Arunabha, which is as vast as four palas, he will be reborn, having fulfilled his lifespan, in the state of a Videha. ||87||
Even though he had practiced ignorance, Varuna, through his path, was reborn as a human being in a good family. ||88||
Having attained humanhood again in the state of a Videha, in a good family, he will worship the path of liberation and attain the state of liberation. ||89||
When Varuna was killed, the soldiers of the Chetaka army became twice as enthusiastic for battle, like a boar that has been touched by a stick. ||90||
With the Ganarajas as their leaders, the soldiers of the Chetaka army, with their unyielding, sharp-beaked army, attacked the lower region with anger. ||91||
Seeing his own army being attacked, the Kunika, like a lion struck by a clod of earth, ran forward with anger. ||92||
Playing in the battlefield like a lotus, the Kunika, the valiant elephant, threw the enemy forces in all directions like petals of a lotus. ||93||
Knowing the Kunika to be invincible, Chetaka, filled with great anger, aimed his divine arrow, a treasure of valor, at him. ||94||
From there, Hari, the lord of the army, pierced the Kunika's vajra armor in front and struck his iron armor in the back. ||95||
Stretching his bowstring, the king of Vaishali also released an arrow, but it was deflected by the vajra armor. ||96||
Seeing that even the infallible arrow was ineffective, the soldiers of the Chetaka army thought that their merit had been exhausted. ||97||
Chetaka, the truthful one, did not release a second arrow. He retreated and fought again on the second day. ||98||
Chetaka's arrow was again ineffective on the second day. Thus, a very fierce battle took place between the two for many days. ||99||
Eighty lakhs plus a crore of soldiers on both sides perished and were reborn in the states of animals and hell. ||100||
Having lost their respective cities, the Ganarajas and Chetaka perished and entered the city. Kunika also blocked the city. ||101||
Then, the entire army of Champesh, mounted

## Chapter 210: The Tale of the Rejection of the Eager One

Having killed, having killed, in the night, the two, Halla and Vihalla, were going along safely. The minister said to the elephant, "O Kūṇika, our entire army has been routed by these two. Tell us, what is the way to defeat Halla and Vihalla?"

The ministers replied, "These two cannot be defeated by anyone. They are mounted on elephants, like men on elephants, and are invincible."

"Therefore, let us try to kill this elephant. Let a pit be dug in the path, filled with Khadira wood and burning coals."

"Let it be covered with water, so that it is difficult to see. The elephant will run fast and fall into it."

Champa ordered a pit to be dug, filled with Khadira wood and burning coals, and covered over, anticipating their arrival.

Then, in the night, Halla and Vihalla, having dismounted, saw the two, Jita and Kashin, mounted on the elephant.

The elephant, coming to the edge of the pit of burning coals, saw the pit and stopped, refusing to go forward.

Then, Halla and Vihalla, rebuking the elephant, said, "You are ungrateful and cowardly, for you have fled from the battle. You have abandoned your kin and gone to a foreign land. You have brought your master, Arya Chetaka, into this misfortune. A dog, fed by you, is better than you, who are always loyal to your master. You are not worthy of life, for you have abandoned your duty to us."

Thus rebuked, the elephant, seeing the two princes on his back, quickly lifted them up, thinking them to be his own, even though they were not.

He himself fell into the pit of burning coals and perished instantly, going to hell.

The two princes said, "What have we done? We have been treated like animals, but the elephant is not an animal. He has been loyal to his master, Arya, and has been in trouble for a long time. He has brought himself to death, and we are still alive, though we are fools."

"We have caused the destruction of a great army, and we have been ungrateful to our kin. We have been destroyed in vain, and we have lost our kinship."

"Therefore, it is not right for us to live any longer. We should become disciples of our valiant master, and there is no other way."

Then, the queen, seeing their remorse, took them to the path of liberation. They were taken to the feet of the great Vīra, and they became monks.

[From the Trishatisalaaka Purva, Chapter 10, Verses 190 to 310] 29. The story of Bahubali and Bharata in the chapter on the teachings of the great Vīra.

The son of the great Rishabhadeva, Bharata, having conquered the six continents in sixty thousand years, came to Ayodhya. While he was being crowned king for twelve years, he saw the people coming and going, and he recognized his brothers who had come there. He sent messengers to his relatives, saying, "O relatives of Bharata, you should serve this king."

They replied, "We are also the sons of the king, and Bharata is also the son of our father. Why should he be greater than us, who desires our service? O messengers, go back to your place. We will go to our father."

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples
We will do what is appropriate. ” Then they went to the Jinantika of Suvarnagiri and said, “O father! Your six-part kingdom is not satisfied, and you want to take our kingdom. By the command of the Bhagavan, we all together take your kingdom.” The master gave a Dharma discourse to those who were enchanted -
"
Wake up, why don't you wake up, tell me, you are a very difficult husband.
There is no peace in this kingdom, nor is there any peace in the future life. || 1 || | "
211
Having heard the Bhagavan's discourse, eighty-nine Bharata brothers performed the vow. Bharata king took their kingdoms. What general did not bow down to the king and say, "Master! Bahubali, the king, was not conquered by you, even though you conquered the six-part kingdom, it was not conquered, because the wheel does not enter the armory.” Having heard this, the eloquent messenger was sent to Taxila. Going by short journeys, he heard the fame of Bahubali from many people in village after village, town after town, and arrived in the city of Taxila. Then, by the order of Bahubali, the messenger, Suvega, was admitted to the inner assembly, which was shining like gold. He bowed to the king and stood in front. Bahubali asked about the well-being of his brother, the city of Bandhavnagar, etc., and after giving the answer, he said, “O king! Your elder brother is eager to meet you and invites you. Therefore, you should go there once, bow down to him, and take his command on your head. Because even the brother does not obey Bharata's command, then his valor is useless, so to destroy the slander of the people, otherwise there will be doubt about your kingdom. Because
I
The fierce poisonous snake, the fire, the wind-blown,
The lord, the one with great prowess, and the trustworthy, these three are not to be trusted. || 1 ||
Even the Nirjaras worship him, there is no inferiority in his service.” Having heard this, the king said, “O messenger! Your king will be ashamed to see me, because in childhood, while playing in the water, he lifted my foot and threw me up in the air like a ball, even that is forgotten! O messenger! Your king has been burdened with sins for sixty thousand years, there is no other redeemer for him, I am the one. Bring him quickly for a test of strength.” Then Suvega returned with fear, and in a few days he came to his city and told Bharata everything about his younger brother. “Bahubali cannot be conquered even by Indra,” having heard this, Bharata, with a million and a half sons, and with his army, marched towards Taxila. Bahubali also came face to face. His eldest son, Somaysha, the king, was the conqueror of a lakh of elephants, horses, and chariots, even alone. He had three lakh of soldiers. Among them, even the youngest was capable of conquering an Akshauhini army. An Akshauhini army consists of - 21890 elephants, 21890 chariots, 65610 horses, 109350 foot soldiers. And in the army of chariots, eighty lakh of horses were said to be neighing at the same time, eighteen lakh of drums were roaring, and sixteen lakh of trumpets. Hearing this, the excited soldiers fought each other every day. Once, Bahubali's devotee, Anilvega, the Vidyadhara, the chariot

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

The commander, having defeated the aerial army of the Chakra, attacked the elephant army. Like balls, the elephants, tossed by the force of his fist, fell back to the ground. Seeing that the Chakra was about to be defeated, he released his chakra. Seeing this, the Chakra, terrified and defeated, fled to the Meru mountains, the ocean, and wherever he went, the chakra, like a karma earned in the past, did not leave his back. Then, using his knowledge, he created a vajra cage and entered it. Then the chakra gods said, "Hey, hey, you rascal! Why are you mocking your own strength?" After six months, he emerged from the cage, and the chakra, having severed his head, remained in the Chakra's hand. Thus, the two fought for twelve years. One day, the eldest son of the Chakra, Surya Yasha, spread like a wildfire in the army of Bahubali. He arrived in front of his father's enemy. Bahubali said, "Son! You are weak, and I am happy that you have dared to attack my army. You, my son, have brought glory to our lineage. But there is no one in the three worlds who can withstand my anger. Therefore, abandon my sight and go far away."

He said, "Father! Who will fulfill my desire for battle today without you?" Saying this, he made the sound of a bowstring. Then the gods, gathering together, forbade the battle between the two brothers and said, "O sons of the king of the ages! Your father has protected this world. Why are you two now trying to destroy it? This is not befitting of you. For the sake of testing your strength, you two should fight with the five weapons given by us: 1. Sight, 2. Speech, 3. Fist, 4. Arm, 5. Weapons and signs." Having accepted the words of the gods, the two brothers stood with the gods as witnesses. Then the Chakra soldiers thought, "Even Indra has doubts about winning a duel with this one. How then will our master win?" Seeing the soldiers thinking this, the Chakra, to show his strength, had a large pit dug and stood at its edge. He bound his left arm with a large iron chain and said to all the soldiers, "All of you, together, pull the chain and throw me into the pit." Even though they all pulled together, his mind did not waver. Because even all the men, women, elephants, horses, and other creatures born on earth could not pull the Chakra even a little, what could the army do? Then the Chakra, with a smile on his face, pulled his own hand. With that, all of them, bound by the chain, hung like vines and birds. Seeing this feat, the witnesses stood far away, happy like spectators.

Then the two kings of the Chakra, standing face to face for the battle of sight, looked at each other with unwavering eyes. Their copper eyes were terrifying. Then, seeing the face of Bahubali, with his terrible eyes, the Chakra's eyes filled with tears and he quickly looked away. His entire army became dejected. Then, ashamed, Bahubali said, "Brother! Why are you worried? Engage in a battle of words with me." Having been told this, the Chakra roared like a lion, and a deafening sound filled the sky. Then, in anger, Bahubali roared like a lion, and all the soldiers fainted. Again, the Chakra king and Bahubali roared with a terrible roar. Then the Chakra's sound, like the shadow of the morning, like the friendship of the wicked,

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples
213

The king was gradually losing strength. Seeing this, the wrestler said to the king, "Brother, do not be disheartened. What if I won by chance? Now be ready for a fistfight." Encouraged by the king, he raised his arms high, roared loudly, and rushed towards the other, embracing him and squeezing him with his arms. Then the king, taking the wrestler in his hand, playfully lifted him high in the air like a ball. In a moment, he disappeared. Both armies cried out in alarm. The king thought, "Until this fellow falls to the ground and does not break, I will take him from the sky." Thinking this, he made his hands small, looked upwards, and stood still. After a long time, he came down. He was held by strong arms. Then, the enraged wrestler struck him on the head with his fist and knocked him unconscious. The king, regaining consciousness after a long time, struck the wrestler on the chest with his fist and fainted. Regaining his senses in a moment, the wrestler, red with anger, struck the king on the head with his club, shattering his crown into a hundred pieces. For a moment, the king closed his eyes and shattered the wrestler's club into pieces with his iron club. Then, the wrestler struck the king with his club, sinking him into the ground up to his knees. Then, the king, emerging from the ground, struck the wrestler with his iron club, sinking him into the ground up to his neck. Regaining consciousness in a moment, he emerged and thought, "The king and the wrestler are never defeated." This is an eternal truth. I have been defeated in five battles. Then, how can I be a wrestler?" While he was thinking this, the chakra-ratna came into his hand. Then, the wrestler said to the king, "Even today, you have not lost anything. Obey my command, or you will become Yama's guest with this chakra." The king said, "Why are you making empty boasts? Show your strength now." And so on, they fought bravely. The wrestler, in anger, released the chakra, made it revolve around him, and then returned it to his hand. Because even in the ordinary chakra-gotra, the chakra does not prevail, then what chance does it have in such a supremely embodied being? Then, the strong-armed one, raising his fist, thought, "Today, I will crush the chakra, the thousand Yakshas, or their lord." And he ran towards the wrestler. Again, he thought, "This will surely lead to his death. Then, people will call me the killer of the six-part lord. Therefore, alas, I have earned many sins through my arrogance. Blessed are those human beings who have taken initiation near their father's feet. Alas, I am still engaged in sin." Thinking this, he struck his own head with the same fist. Then, the gods, saying "Well done, well done," showered flowers upon him. 29. The story of Attanmalla in the Niyuddhyadhyana section of the Shri Avashyakahari Bhadriya Vritta.

Ujjayini is a city. In it, there was a very strong wrestler named Attan. In the city of Sopara, there was a king named Singhagir, who was a lover of wrestlers. He gave a lot of wealth to whoever defeated the wrestler. Attan went there and defeated a wrestler named Phalihamalla in the village of Bharugachchharana, which is far away. In the same way, other things should be done according to one's own intelligence. We will only tell the stories. Even the story that is bound to the authorized story is told for the benefit of the people. In

## The Story of the Eager Rejection

A king, eager to acquire a rare gem, sent his envoy to a distant land. The envoy, however, was careless and lost the gem on the way. Feeling ashamed, he thought, "This is a great loss for me." He then saw a fish drinking water and, out of anger, killed it. Later, he realized his mistake and thought, "This was a terrible act."

He then went to a city and, seeing a man carrying a heavy load, asked him, "What is your livelihood?" The man replied, "I am a farmer, and you are my lord." The envoy, feeling remorseful, gave the farmer a gift of cotton.

The envoy then went to Ujjain and, seeing a young man, trained him in warfare. When the time came for the king to claim the gem, the envoy went to the king. On the first day, the envoy fought against the gem-bearing warrior and the fish-warrior, but he was defeated. The king, however, was hopeful and said, "He will succeed tomorrow."

The envoy went to the farmer and asked him, "What troubles you?" The farmer replied, "I am troubled by the fish-warrior, who has challenged me to a duel." The envoy, not wanting to lose the gem, said, "I will fight him for you."

On the second day, the envoy fought the fish-warrior. On the third day, the envoy, seeing the fish-warrior's strength, asked the farmer to help him. The farmer, holding the envoy's head, threw him into a well. The envoy was saved and went to Ujjain, where he received the five auspicious signs and enjoyed great wealth. This is the story of the eager rejection.

## The Story of Rathnemi

Rathnemi, the younger brother of a king, sent a message to Rajimati, a princess, expressing his desire to marry her. Rajimati thought, "My brother loves me and has sent this message, so I will accept it."

However, when Rathnemi later asked for her hand in marriage, she said, "You have tasted the fruit of love, now eat its bitter fruit." Rathnemi asked, "Why should I eat the bitter fruit of your love?" Rajimati replied, "Then why do you want to marry me, who has been rejected by her brother?"

She continued, "Who, remembering the donkey, considers it precious? Who, rejecting a gem, desires a piece of glass? Even in my past lives, there was no one better than Nemir. In another life, Nemir, born with complete knowledge, was the lord of the world. He lived in the same time as the king of the Raivata kingdom. At that time, Rajimati, observing a vow, became a great being. Nemir, her younger brother, also observed the vow. One day, after receiving permission from the Jina, he went to the city to beg for alms and returned home."

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam

**For the sake of Varaatika, therefore, one should destroy a koti (a large number). Therefore, having established steadfastness, one should practice pure dharma.** ||2||

Hearing this statement, which is full of reason, even a woman born of a cow would consider him fortunate, a treasure trove of virtues. Drowned in the ocean of evil deeds, alas, even a man is a disgrace. ||3||

Thus, hearing the teachings of Rajimati, Sumati, the chief disciple, immediately gave up the false pride and practiced dharma diligently. ||4||

**30. Sangadhyana, Sriparishishtaparva, within which is the story of Bhavadeva.**

The Lord also spoke thus in Jambudvipa, in Bharat, in the Magadha country, in the village called Sugrama. ||2||

Aryavanas, a Rashtrakoota, was his father, and his wife was Revati. Bhavadatta and Bhavadeva were their two sons. ||2||

(Pair) Bhavadatta, a firm boat for crossing the ocean of existence. Even in his youth, he took initiation in the presence of a well-established Acharya. ||3||

He, observing his vows, with a sharp sword, a master of scriptures, lived with his Guru, like a second body. ||4||

Once, a virtuous man in that order informed the Acharyas. "Allow me to go where my relatives are." ||5||

"My younger brother is there, he is very affectionate towards me. Seeing me, he will also become a monk, by nature, he is good." ||6||

Then, the Guru, along with the virtuous, knowledgeable ones, instructed him. "The Guru rejoices in a disciple who is dedicated to the liberation of others." ||7||

He went to his father's place, which he had just left, and saw his brother's wedding, a celebration of the Kamadeva tree. ||8||

Engrossed in the excitement of the wedding, his brother, a son of a Muni, forgot what should not be done, he became like a cotton ball. ||9||

At the time of the wedding, he did not recognize his elder brother, as if he did not know him. He did not even welcome him, nor did he tell him about his vows. ||10||

The Muni, feeling ashamed, went to the Guru again. He told him everything about his brother's behavior. ||11||

Bhavadeva said, "Alas! The hardness of human nature! He disregarded his elder brother, a Rishi who had come to his house." ||12||

"What is the value of wedding excitement compared to devotion to the Guru? Leaving that aside, he did not welcome his elder brother with joy." ||13||

A virtuous man said then, "Bhavadeva, you are wise. If you will make your younger brother a monk." ||14||

Bhavadeva said, "If the Guru will stay in the Magadha country, then he will show his kindness." ||15||

The virtuous ones, while traveling, went to Magadha. Like the wind, the Shramanas do not stay in one place. ||16||

After paying respects to the Acharya's feet, Bhavadatta requested, "With your permission, I wish to see my relatives who are nearby." ||17||

The Guru then instructed Bhavadatta, saying, "Even a solitary one deserves to wander, O Muni, who is under control." || 18 || Bhavadatta then went to the house of his own worldly relatives, to grace his own human being with the acceptance of renunciation. || 19 || Bhavadatta's younger brother, Bhavadeva, then married the daughter of Nagadatta, born of Vasuki's womb. || 20 || All the relatives joyfully celebrated the wedding, considering that gathering to be a festival above festivals. || 21 || Immediately, they washed his feet with water and offered him a towel, considering the water from his feet to be superior to holy water. || 22 || Fearing the danger of drowning in the ocean of existence, they all clung to his feet as if seeking support. || 23 || The Muni also addressed his relatives, saying, "O relatives, you are troubled by the wedding! Go and wander elsewhere, may you have the gain of Dharma, O sinless ones!" || 24 || All the relatives joyfully offered him food and drink, with fragrant and auspicious towels. || 25 || At that time, Bhavadeva, upholding the family tradition, adorned his new bride, who was to be served by his peers. || 26 || He applied sandalwood paste to his beloved's body, like the moon's rays attracted by the moon. || 27 || On her head, he tied a garland of fragrant flowers, like the moon's rays shining on the moon's orb. || 28 || On her cheeks, he drew a creeper of jasmine, like the mark of victory on the banner of the fish. || 29 || While he was adorning his new bride's breasts, he heard the arrival of the great Muni Bhavadatta. || 30 || Excited by the sight of his brother, he was like a gambler who had won, abandoning his beloved, who was adorned only halfway. || 31 || He did not listen to the words of his beloved's friends, who said, "It is not proper for you to leave her adorned only halfway." || 32 || He replied to those who were holding him back, saying, "I will return to the girls after paying my respects to the Guru!" || 33 || Bhavadatta then flew from that place like a bird, and approaching the Muni Bhavadatta who was standing there, he paid his respects. || 34 || As soon as his younger brother rose after paying his respects, the Muni offered him a pot of ghee, like a true offering for the acceptance of Shramanya. || 35 || Bhavadatta then left the house, the crown of the homeless, and went to the abode of the wise, his mind fixed on his brother. || 36 || Bhavadeva, holding the pot of ghee in his hand, followed the Muni Bhavadatta, his six steps following his lotus feet. || 37 || Many other women and men, like Bhavadeva, followed the Muni Bhavadatta, like waves surging in the ocean. || 38 || The Muni created a suitable offering for the Munis, and the people did not turn back, not being released by the Muni. || 39 || After going a long distance, they were disappointed, and after paying their respects to the great Muni, the women and men then turned back on their own. || 40 || Bhavadeva, with a good mind, thought to himself, "Although they are not released, they turn back, for they are not my brothers. || 41 || But I am his brother, we two are bound by mutual affection. Therefore, it is not right for me to turn back, not being

## Chapter 218: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

The elder brother, burdened by the weight of food and drink, was surely overcome. Therefore, he graciously offered the ghee pot to me to carry. ||43||

The elder brother, a sage, had arrived after a long time, weary and exhausted. I could not bear to leave him there and return without him. ||44||

The younger brother, to distract his mind from the thought, "He might be angry," began to talk about household matters. The great sage, Bhavadatta, listened patiently. ||45||

"These are the trees that line the village, the resting places for travelers. You two, like monkeys, roam freely among them." ||46||

"These are the lakes, where we, in our childhood, used to play with lotus stems, our throats adorned with their beauty." ||47||

"These are the lands that stretch to the village, like grains of sand. Here, we used to play with sand mounds, during the rainy season." ||48||

Bhavadatta, speaking thus to his younger brother, went to the village, sanctified by the lotus feet of the Acharya. ||49||

Seeing Bhavadatta, the sage, with his younger brother, arrive at the door, the small ones, with crooked smiles, said to each other: ||50||

"Surely, this man, adorned in divine attire, is a disciple of the sage, brought here to renounce the world and speak the truth." ||51||

"Bhavadatta, who is this young man who has arrived?" asked the sun. He replied, "This is my younger brother, who desires to see the Lord." ||52||

Sarina, Bhavadatta's elder brother, asked, "Why have you come to renounce the world?" He replied, "My brother is not a liar, it is true." ||53||

Bhavadatta, then, renounced the world, accompanied by the sages. He was deemed fit to wander elsewhere, with the virtuous. ||54||

Thinking, "Has Bhavadatta not arrived yet?" his relatives, coming from behind, spoke to Bhavadatta. ||55||

"Bhavadatta, you have left your beloved, adorned with half her ornaments, behind. Why have you not returned? We are like the living dead without him." ||56||

Like a cuckoo, she, deprived of her beloved, grieves. Her tears, like the sap of a vine, do not cease to flow. ||57||

"Bhavadatta, without asking us, would never leave. It is unthinkable, even in a dream. Where has he gone? What has happened?" ||58||

"We are like those who have lost their own, seeing Bhavadatta nowhere. O sage, please tell us, where is your younger brother?" ||59||

The sage, even though he knew the truth, said, "My younger brother, desiring the water of Dharma, has gone somewhere. We do not know where he has gone, even though he has just arrived." ||60||

"Has he gone on another journey?" they asked, quickly. They returned, dejected, like those who have been robbed by thieves. ||61||

Bhavadatta, remembering his newly married wife in his heart, solely out of brotherly love, continued his renunciation, even though it was painful. ||62||

The great sage, Bhavadatta, after many years, renounced food and became a celestial being, due to his virtue. ||63||

"Bhavadatta, my beloved, Nagila, is like a barren tree. I am also like a barren tree, separated from her. We both are bereft." ||64||

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

A doe deprived of its youth, a parrot bound by a snare. I think she will become compassionate towards the people who are suffering. ||68|| (Pair) If I find her, my beloved with beautiful eyes, alive, then even today I will be satisfied in my household with her. ||69|| Thus, controlling himself with the threads of worry, he became like a wool-gatherer. Without asking the elder sages, he set out. ||70|| He quickly went to the village, a good village, the land of the Rashtrakutas. He stood outside the closed door, near the courtyard. ||71|| A woman with a garland of flowers in her hair, a Brahmin woman, came along with her. Seeing her, the sage bowed to her and she bowed to him. ||72|| The Rashtrakuta, the noble one, asked her, "O blessed one! Is his wife Revati alive or not?" ||73|| She said, "The noble one and Revati are both in distress. A long time will pass for them in distress." ||74|| The sage again asked the son of the noble one, "Is the new bride, the one who was abandoned by Bhavadeva, alive or not?" ||75|| She thought, "This Bhavadeva is surely a fool, a fool from birth. If I tell him about this, he will be angry with me." ||76|| Thinking thus, the son of the noble one Revati said, "Are you Bhavadeva? What are you doing here, ascetic?" ||77|| Bhavadeva said, "You have recognized me well. I am Bhavadeva, the lord of the Nagila life." ||78|| "Then, being prevented by my elder brother, I abandoned her and set out. Even though I didn't want to, I took on this difficult vow. ||79|| Now, my brother is in distress, without a whip. How did Nagila become like this? I want to know that." ||80|| Nagila thought, "He has seen me after a long time. He doesn't recognize me, because of my changed appearance." ||81|| "I will make myself known to him," said Nagila. "I am Nagila, the new bride, the one you abandoned." ||82|| "In all this time, even my youth has passed. What beauty is there in me, O virtuous one? Consider it." ||83|| "Leaving behind the three jewels, which give the fruits of heaven and liberation, do not take me, O great one, who is like a mere ant. ||84|| Do not fall into the terrible hell, which is the result of the weapons of the senses, the arrows of desire. ||85|| You have taken on a vow, disguised by your brother, who is a well-wisher. Do not think that I am not worthy of you, even though you have not attained him, and you are attached to me, a sinner. ||86|| Even today, return to the feet of your guru. Tell him about the sin I have committed because of my attachment to you. ||87|| While Bhavadeva was thus being persuaded by Nagila, a Brahmin boy came there, having eaten payasa. ||88|| He said, "I have eaten the payasa, which is like nectar, today. I will vomit it. Mother, hold the vessel." ||89|| "I have been invited elsewhere, where I will get a gift. I cannot eat the payasa again, because I am going to eat elsewhere." ||90|| "Taking the gift, I have come here again for payasa. I will vomit it myself and eat it myself. What is there in

## The Discourse on the Rejection of the Eager One

The Brahman said, "You will become a vomit-eater, you will be disgusted. Enough of this disgusting act, child!" || 92 ||

Hearing this, Bhavadeva also said, "Oh, boy! You will become a vomit-eater, lower than even a dog." || 93 ||

Nagila said, "If you know this, O Rishi, and you speak it, then why do you still desire to eat me?" || 94 ||

"I am the lowest of the low, filled with the flesh, bones, excrement, and urine of animals. I am even more disgusting than vomit. Why are you not ashamed to desire me?" || 95 ||

"You see the burning fire, but you do not see the fire beneath your feet. You teach others this way, but you do not teach yourself." || 96 ||

"What is the merit of those who are skilled in teaching others? The merit of people lies in those who are skilled in teaching themselves." || 97 ||

Bhavadeva said, "I have been well taught by you, O sinless one! I was led astray like a blind man on the path. Now, having seen my own people, I will go to the presence of my Guru. I will contemplate my transgressions and perform the difficult penance." || 98 ||

Nagila also said, "Why are you concerned with your own people and their share of your wealth? They are obstacles to your seeing the Guru, for they are embodied." || 100 ||

"Therefore, go to the feet of your Guru, with a tamed mind, and practice your vows. I will also renounce in the presence of the renunciates." || 101 ||

Bhavadeva then bowed to the worthy images, with a composed mind. He went to the Guru's place and performed the necessary actions, such as contemplation. || 102 ||

Bhavadeva, maintaining his renunciation without transgression, lived for a long time and in the beginning of the Kalpa, he became a Chakra-Samanika (a celestial being) in the heavens. || 103 ||

## Appendix Chapter, Verses 287 to 389
## 31. The Story of Mammana in the Commentary on the *Aavashyakaharitriya* by Shri Sangrahadhyana

There was a man named Mammana. He was afflicted by greed and had accumulated a great deal of wealth. He did not eat or drink, and he had a large, strong, beautiful, golden chariot made by many crores of skilled artisans, adorned with divine jewels and a magnificent, powerful horse. He had another chariot, also made by many artisans. He was having this chariot made, and every day, for the purpose of its construction, he would bring many cartloads of wood, which was very hard and difficult to obtain.

One day, the king was going out with his queen, and he saw this man. He was moved with compassion and said to the queen, "Look, how hard these people work for the king! They fill their carts with heavy wood, which is difficult to obtain." || 1 ||

The king asked, "What is it?" The queen said, "This man is afflicted by greed." The king, hearing this, said, "What are you afflicted by?" The man said, "My chariot is not complete." The king said, "Take some gold." The man said, "I have no need for it. Just complete my chariot." The king, having been told this, took him home and showed him his treasury. The king said, "Even with all my wealth, it will not be enough to complete this chariot." The man said

Chapter:-2 Collection of Examples
221
"Are you troubled?", he said, "My body is troubled by the defilements, there are no valuable things in this world, even if they are worth a lot, they should be abandoned, what is the point of doing this?", the king said, "May your mind be at peace, you are capable of filling the entire universe, but I am not, I am already full." 33. The story of Nanda in the Sri Samvega Rangshala during the meditation on buying and selling. In the city of Padaliputta, there was a king named Jayasena, who was full of virtues and victorious in many battles. ||1||
There, in that city, the wealthy merchants of Kubera were living.
Nanda, the happy merchant, and Jinadasa, the righteous and strong. ||2||
Once, a merchant named Samuddadatta,
dug a well in a lake that had been there for a long time. ||3||
While digging, he found,
golden nuggets, buried for a long time and covered in dirt. ||4||
Thinking that it was metal, the merchants wanted to buy it.
Jinadasa took two of them, which were made of metal. ||5||
Then, by his own rule, he correctly identified them as gold.
He gave them to the temple, measuring them carefully. ||6||
The others did not take them, not knowing that Nanda was a wise man.
He was eager to take them, because he was a good man. ||7||
Uddaka said, "Don't give the metal nuggets to anyone else.
I want to break them, and I will give you something in return." ||8||
The next day, his friend took him to a feast.
His son said, "Take the nuggets, as you wish." ||9||
He took the nuggets happily, and went to his friend's house to eat.
He was very happy, and went to the house to eat. ||10||
He did not take the nuggets, because he was a good man, and he knew that they were not worth anything.
Uddaka, the wise man, went to the king's court. ||11||
He went from place to place, and he saw that the nuggets were very valuable.
One of the nuggets had a mark of a chameleon on it. ||12||
The king's men took the nuggets, and gave them to the king.
They asked, "What should we do with these nuggets?" ||13||
They said, "Oh king! These two nuggets were given to Jinadasa, the merchant.
The rest of the nuggets belong to Nanda, the merchant." ||14||
The king said this, and asked Jinadasa, "What is your opinion?"
Jinadasa was very honest, and he followed the rules of the scriptures. ||15||

Hearing this, the serpent was also pleased and became a believer. A younger brother came there and seeing her, said this:

**16.** "Though protected by the elder brother, I will still go to her. I will enjoy hearing the sound of her broken bones."

**17.** Hearing this, the cruel serpent also did the same. Thinking, "This is my enemy," she was distressed.

**18.** She knew, "This is my wife, the elder brother is her enemy. Her son was beautiful and dear to her due to past karma."

**19.** "This one, due to past karma, is the younger brother, her enemy. He was born as Ganga-datta, his past karma is not different."

**20.** Then, disgusted, the father and the two sons took the vow. The noble Lalita and the great Shukra went to heaven.

**21.** Remembering his mother's misfortune, Ganga-datta, now obtaining the world of the universe, also went to the heaven of the great Shukra.

**22.** **35. The story of Brahmadatta in the Abode of the Teachings of Sri Upadesha Prasada**

The king of Kampilya, Brahma-raja, had four friends: the king of Kashi, Kataka; the king of Gajapura, Karenu (Neru); the king of Kosala, Dirgha; and the king of Champa, Pushpachula. These kings, out of love, stayed in each other's kingdoms for one year each. Once, they all came together to Brahma-raja. At that time, Brahma-raja, suffering from a headache, released his son and said to them, "You should carry out the succession of the kingdom." Then he died. They all left, returning to their own kingdoms. Then Dirgha became attached to a courtesan. Knowing this, his minister Dhanurmantri informed his son, Varadhanu, "You should inform Brahmadatta, who is in seclusion with the courtesan, about this situation." He informed him, and then, going to the inner palace, he killed a crow, saying, "Whoever else does this, I will punish him." Dirgha heard this news and said to the courtesan, "I am the crow, you are the cuckoo." She said, "This child, what does he know about our nature?" Again, he brought a buffalo and an elephant together and said the same words as before. The buffalo was killed. Then Dirgha thought, "My sin is known by this. He is teaching me by speaking to others." He informed the queen about this thought. Then she said, "This son is being killed. If we are well, we will have many sons." He agreed. Then he married a daughter of a vassal, built a house for her, and gave it to her. Varadhanu, the minister, secretly built a tunnel from the house to the royal garden. On an auspicious day, Varadhanu, with his bride, entered the house. After two nights, the house was set on fire. They escaped through the tunnel and came out through the front gate, riding on a pair of horses. Brahmadatta, wandering the earth, obtained the sovereignty of the world. Varadhanu was appointed as the commander-in-chief and sent to Dirgha. Then Brahmadatta came, captured Dirgha, who was weak, and brought him to his own house. In this way, he conquered the entire six-part Bharat.

Once, while wandering alone in the forest, he was given water by a Brahmin. That Brahmin, knowing that he had attained the position of emperor, thought, "How will he recognize me in a large army?"

## Chapter 224: The Story of the King Who Rejected the Advice of the Wise Man

The king was wandering around. Seeing this, his servants informed him. Pleased by this, the king granted him a boon. The wise man, using the words of a woman, asked for food and gold coins from house to house. The king did as he asked. One day, the wise man said, "Give me your food." The king replied, "My food is for me alone." The wise man said, "You are a miser, you are unable to give." Then, the king fed him and his family. He became intoxicated with lust. At night, he engaged in animalistic behavior with his mother and others. He was ashamed of his actions after he sobered up. 

Then, one day, seeing a shepherd making holes in peepal leaves with an arrow, he gave him something and made him blind the king. The king was captured and about to be killed. When asked how he had done this, the shepherd pointed to the wise man. Then, the king and his family were killed. 

After this, the wise man, enraged by the killing of his family, ordered the king's men to bring him the eyes of the Brahmins every day. The minister brought them and showed them to the king. The king crushed them with his hand and released them. The minister, seeing the killing of so many lives, took a plate with a head and seedless vataguṇḍaka fruits and presented it to the king. The king, in his drunken rage, killed him. 

Thus, after sixteen years, he died in a fit of rage and went to the seventh hell. 

**Verse 1:** 
The king, with the heart filled with the cruelty of crushing vataguṇḍaka fruits and the violence of blinding eyes, went to hell, filled with the thoughts of harming and killing. 

**Chapter 36: The Story of Prasannachandra in the Sri Samvega Rangashala**

**Verse 1:** 
The king of Poyanapura, Uggavisa, was unable to bear the burden of the kingdom. He wanted to renounce the world and become a Jain monk. Prasannachandra was a renunciant. 

**Verse 2:** 
He was wandering with his guru, Jayaguru, and had attained wealth in the city of Rayaggingham. He was content with his simple life, relying on the support of his shoulders. 

**Verse 3:** 
He was seen by two groups of people: those who worshipped the Jinas and those who were enemies of the Jinas. 

**Verse 4:** 
The group who worshipped the Jinas said, "Victory to him! This is the easy way to live. If he renounces the kingdom and becomes a monk, he will be happy." 

**Verse 5:** 
The group who were enemies of the Jinas said, "Friend! Stop this talk. He is unfit to be a king. He should have put his son on the throne." 

**Verse 6:** 
"He has renounced the wrong path and is living in fear of his enemies. He is enjoying the kingdom, but he is suffering from his enemies."

Thus thought the Takkhan-Vissumariyadhamma-Jhana-Padibandho. The king, with a happy mind, was deeply engrossed in thought. ||7|| Who, in this living world, knows the truth about me, even in my own self? This is a very difficult thing for me to understand. ||8|| Having been defeated, I will do good, as I did in the past. I was defeated in battle, and I was defeated by them. ||9|| Drink the nectar of Dhamma-Jhana, I am the king who has conquered the world. Oh! What is this great power? I am filled with wonder. ||10|| With devotion and respect, I bow down to all the Tirthankaras. I think that this kind of peaceful Jhana is like a treasure. ||11|| This great power, where did it arise? I will ask the Jina. Thinking this, I went to the Jina's presence. ||12|| Asked by the Jina, the king, with a happy mind, said, "Where will I be reborn after death? Tell me." ||13|| The Jina said, "O king, you will be reborn in hell." The king was very upset and thought, "This is not right." ||14|| In the meantime, the king, with a troubled mind, was defeated by the enemy, who had taken away his weapons and his crown. ||15|| The enemy, with a cruel heart, struck the king on the head with his sword. The king was wounded and fell to the ground. ||16|| "I am a monk," he thought, "what is the use of this peaceful Jhana? I have been defeated by this great power, which has made me a Kevali." ||17|| The glory of the Kevali, surrounded by the gods, was heard by the king. "What is this fearsome power?" he thought. ||18|| The Jina said, "The glory of the Kevali is the power of the king. The gods are doing this." The king was amazed. ||19||

## The Story of the Oil Debt and the Release of the Daughter

37. This story is about the debt of oil and the release of the daughter, which is related to the practice of offering food to the Jain monks.

In the Kosala region, there was a village where a householder named Devraja lived. His wife was named Sarika, and they had many sons, including Sammata, and many daughters, including Sammati. The entire family was deeply devoted to the Jain faith. In the same village, there was a wealthy merchant named Shivadeva, whose wife was named Shiva.

One day, the sun god, known as Samudraghosha, came to the village. Hearing about the Jain religion, which was established by the Tirthankaras, Sammata was deeply moved and took initiation. Over time, he became very knowledgeable about the teachings of his guru. One day, he thought, "If someone from my family were to become a monk, it would be very auspicious. After all, the greatest act of kindness is to help beings escape the cycle of birth and death." With this thought in mind, he went to his guru and asked for permission to return to his village. He then went to a nearby village and asked an elderly man, "Is there anyone from the family of Devraja, the householder, still alive?" The man replied, "Everyone in his family is dead, except for his daughter, Sammati, who is a widow." Sammata then went to her house. Seeing her brother, Sammati was overjoyed and bowed to him. After spending some time with him, she prepared food for him. However, Sammata politely refused, saying, "It is not appropriate for us to accept anything for ourselves."

When it was time for Sammata's brother to beg for food, she was unable to find even a drop of oil anywhere. She went to the market and borrowed two palas of oil from Shivadeva, the merchant. She promised to repay the debt with interest, doubling the amount each day. Sammata's brother, unaware of the situation, accepted the oil, believing it to be pure. That day, Sammata listened to the teachings of her brother. She was so engrossed in the teachings that she forgot to bring the oil into the house. The next day, her brother went out to beg for food. Sammati was so overwhelmed with grief at his absence that she forgot to double the amount of oil. On the third day, the debt had doubled to four palas of oil, which was a huge amount. She was unable to bring it into the house. She also had to cook food and fetch water. The entire day was spent in these tasks, and she was unable to repay the debt. The debt continued to grow exponentially, doubling each day, until it became an enormous amount.

Sammati went to the merchant and said, "Please give me back my oil, or I will become your servant." She was unable to repay the debt, so she agreed to become a servant. Many years passed. Sammata's brother, Sammata, came to the village to beg for food. He did not see his sister at home. When he returned, he asked about her. Sammati told him the whole story of her misfortune, including her servitude to Shivadeva. She expressed her sorrow and began to cry. Sammata comforted her, saying, "Don't cry. I will soon free you." He then thought of a way to free her. First, he went to Shivadeva's house. Shiva's wife was washing her hands with water to prepare for offering food to the monk. Sammata stopped her, saying, "

227

Just as we do not find it suitable to beg, so a wealthy merchant from a nearby region said, "What is the fault here?" Then the sage explained in detail the faults like bodily violence, etc., according to the scriptures. Then the merchant said, "O venerable one! Where do you reside, so that we who have come here may hear the Dharma?" Then the sage replied, "I have no fixed abode yet." Then the merchant offered him a place in his own house to stay, and he listened to the Dharma every day, and he also adopted the right faith and minor vows. The sage also narrated many stories of the past, like those of Vasudeva, etc., who had accepted vows, such as, "If even my own son wishes to renounce the world, I will not stop him," etc. Hearing this, Shivadeva also accepted a vow, saying, "O venerable one! If anyone of mine also renounces the world, I will not stop him." In the meantime, Shivadeva's eldest son and the sage's sister, both agreed to renounce the world. The merchant sent them both forth, and they renounced the world. 38. The story of Parashurama and Subhūma in the *Śrī Upadeshamālā* is relevant to the topic of renunciation.

In Gajapura, the sister of Anantavīrya, the king, named Reṇukā, was married to the sage Jamadagni. Once, she came to Gajapura to visit her sister, and the king had a son born to her. The sage took her away. Her eldest son was Rāma, who possessed the knowledge of the *Parashu* (axe) given by the *Vidyādhara* (celestial being) Dattā. He killed his mother and her children in a fit of anger, thinking that they were a disgrace to the family. Hearing this, Anantavīrya came and destroyed the sage's hermitage. Rāma also cut off his head with his axe. Anantavīrya's son, Kārtavīrya, became king. Hearing this story, he became envious and killed Jamadagni. Rāma killed him too. His wife, Sutārā, was pregnant and fled in fear to the sage's hermitage. There, in her confusion, she gave birth to a child who fell to the ground and took the earth in his mouth. Because of this, he was named Subhūma. Rāma went there and took over his kingdom. In a fit of anger, he made the earth devoid of Kshatriyas seven times. He made the earth the abode of the teeth of the chief Kshatriyas. Once, he asked a soothsayer, "How will I die?" He said, "When the teeth that are lying on the earth in your presence become milky, then." To fulfill this prophecy, he had a platform made and placed in front of his throne, and he held a sacrifice there. Because of the prophecy of the soothsayer, Subhūma was served by the *Vidyādhara* Meghanāda and grew prosperous. He asked his mother, "Is this the only world?" Hearing this, she wept. He asked, "Mother, what is this?" She told him the whole story. Then, filled with pride, he went to Gajapura, entered the sacrificial hall, sat on the throne, and the teeth that had become milky began to eat him. Rāma heard this, came there with his army, and then, due to the merit of Subhūma, the axe that had been given to him by the *Vidyādhara* blazed forth in the presence of the Kshatriyas. Meghan

## The Scattering of the Rejection of Eagerness
## 38. The Analogy of the Farmer in the Presence of the Glorious Preceptor, Due to Hatred

Once, the Great Hero, the Jina, Gautama, while wandering like a Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree), addressed a farmer on the path: "O son! This farmer you see before you, for his enlightenment, you should quickly go there. Great benefit will come to you from him." Accepting this, Gautama went there and said: "O noble one! Is your Samadhi (meditation) present? Why do you, with your many senses and other living beings, engage in this farming, which is full of violence, and thus commit sins? How can your soul be thrown into ruin for the sake of a family of sinners?"

Because:

> The world is not yours, nor is it anyone else's.
> Whatever karma you do, you will reap its fruits.
> At the time of your karma's fruition,
> Neither relatives nor friends will help you. ||1||

Therefore, taking refuge in penance, and being drenched in the nectar of the true words, "From the ocean of existence, you will be liberated," he spoke: "Master! I am a Brahmin, and for the sake of fulfilling the desires of my seven daughters and others, I commit many sinful acts. Therefore, you are my brother and mother. Whatever you command, I will do. I will not disobey your revered words." Then, he also accepted the virtuous garb offered to him. Taking him, who had taken the vow, with him, Gautama went towards the Jina. Then, he asked: "Revered one! Where are we going?" Gautama replied: "Where my teachers are, there." He asked: "Those who are worshipped by gods and demons, are they also worthy of your worship? What are they like?" Then, the qualities of the Arhat (liberated one) were explained to him. Hearing this, he attained right faith, and due to seeing the wealth of the Jina, he attained it in a special way. Then, gradually, as he saw the glorious hero, adorned with his robes, hatred arose in his mind. Gautama said: "O Muni! Worship the glorious hero." He replied to the Ganadhara (leader of the assembly): "If this is your teacher, then there is no purpose for my renunciation. Being your disciple is enough. Take this garb. I will go to my own temple." Saying this, when he had abandoned his garb, clenched his fist, and departed, seeing his actions, all the gods, starting with Indra, laughed and said: "Oh! Indra-bhuthi has acquired a better disciple. Seeing this wonder, Gautama, ashamed in his mind, asked the hero the reason for his hatred. The master replied to him: "O son! By contemplating the qualities of the Arhat, his knots have been broken. Therefore, great benefit has come to him and to you. As to why hatred arose in him upon seeing me, listen to his story: In the past, in the city of Potanapura, I was Vasudeva, the son of the king of the Prajapatis, named Tripṛṣṭha. At that time, the king of the three regions, the wielder of the half-wheel, was named Ashvagrīva. Once, in his assembly, he asked a knower of omens about his own closing of his eyes. He replied: "From the hand of Tripṛṣṭha, your death will come." From then on, I, carrying hatred for Tripṛṣṭha, devised ways to kill him. But they all proved futile. Once, in the forest before that city, a lion was causing havoc

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples
229

The king of the Prajapatis had a charioteer. When his father was forbidden, he mounted his chariot with the charioteer to protect the three-backed creature from the attack. As soon as he was addressed, the lion ran towards him. Then the three-backed creature, with the force of a cluster of conch shells, split the lion's mouth in two, making the lion half-dead. Then the lion blamed himself, "Alas! I have been killed by a mere human!" Then the sweet-tongued charioteer comforted him, "O lion! This one is going to be Vasudeva. Do not consider him a mere beggar. If you die by the hand of the king of men, why are you disheartened? This one is a lion in the mortal world, but you are in the animal realm."  Encouraged by these words, the lion attained peace and closed his eyes. Then all three of them wandered in the ocean of existence, and in due course, they were born here. The three-backed creature was born as I, the lion was born as a farmer, and the charioteer was born as you, Indra-bhuthi. In the past, you were pleased by his sweet words, and I killed him. In this play of existence, the cause of love and hatred should be understood. However, you have been born with a white side. 38. The story of Sudarshan in the Sri-Upadesha-Prasada, a treatise on the avoidance of hatred.

In Champa, there was a wealthy merchant named Rishabhadasa. His wife was a virtuous woman named Sushilā. In the month of Magha, another wealthy merchant named Subhaga, along with his wife, went to his house. In the evening, they saw a Muni on the road, shivering from the cold, sitting near an image. They praised him and went home. After spending the night, they got up early in the morning and went out with their wives. Seeing the Muni still there, they sat down beside him. As the sun rose, the Muni said, "Namo Arihantaṇam" and flew up into the sky. Then he considered that the Muni's words were like a mantra of celestial knowledge and imprinted them in his mind. He used to recite them in the presence of the Arhat. Seeing him absorbed in meditation, the merchant asked, "How did you get this?" He said, "From the Muni."  Satisfied with the whole story, the merchant paid him full respects.

From then on, he continued to praise the Muni. In due course, a year passed. Then, due to a cloud, the earth was flooded. The merchant's wife, fearing for her life, went to the forest. In the meantime, the river flooded. Then, remembering the celestial knowledge, he jumped into the river. In the process, he was pierced by a nail and died. He was reborn as the son of the same merchant, named Sudarshan. In due course, he was married to Manorama, the daughter of his parents. From then on, he developed a strong friendship with Kapila, the king's priest. One day, his wife, Kapila, who was eager for love, having heard about her husband's virtues, went to Sudarshan's palace and said, "My dear, you have a beautiful body. Therefore, you should come to my house soon to inquire about my well-being." She secretly took him inside her house, closed the door, left her shawl, and begged him for love. Then, the merchant, who was a hypocrite, in order to protect his virtue, said, "I am a hypocrite, my dear. Why do you ask me in vain?" He went out and returned home.

## The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

He fled. Then Nanda's cavalry pursued him, and one of them was seen from afar. Chanakya, bowing down, hid the moon in the lake and himself began the work of a washerman. From there, that cavalryman asked him, "Have you seen Chandragupta passing by here?" He replied, "He has entered this lake." Then that man, wearing only a loincloth, entered the lake. At that time, Chanakya cut off his head with his own sword. Then, mounting the moon on that horse, he rode forward. He asked the moon, "O son! What did you meditate on when I sent you to the lake?" "O venerable one! The best ones do only the best," he said with humility. Then, knowing that the moon was afflicted by hunger, Chanakya, himself going to eat, saw a Brahmin on the path who had just eaten a mouthful of food. He ripped open his stomach, took the food, and fed the moon. The moon, being hungry, did not know the taste of the food. 

Then, the Mauryan army was assembled. On the next day, while wandering for alms in a village, he went to a house with a fire pit. There, an old woman had placed a large quantity of hot embers in a pot. A child, hungry, put his hand into the embers, and his finger was burnt. He cried out loudly. The old woman said to him, "O fool! You are as dull as Chanakya." Hearing this, the mendicant asked, "O mother! How did you make this comparison to Chanakya?" She said to him, "Just as Chanakya, while conquering the external country, was a fool in guarding Pataliputra and was caught, so also this child, slowly licking around, put his hand in the middle and met with ridicule." 

Hearing these words, Chanakya, having determined the truth of the teaching, wandered and gradually formed a close friendship with the king of the mountains. The other day, he said to that king, "If you are willing, then uproot Nanda and divide his kingdom, and rule it without fear." Then, with his army, the king of the mountains, and Chandragupta, Chanakya began the conquest of Nanda's country. 

Seeing that he was unable to capture one city by force, Chanakya, disguised as a mendicant, entered it. Entering and looking at the buildings, he saw seven beautiful princesses, the daughters of Indra. Understanding that the city was ruined by their brilliance, he thought, "How can I conquer these?" As he was pondering this, the citizens, distressed by the siege, asked him, "O venerable one! When will this siege end?" He said, "As long as the images of these goddesses are here, how can there be an end to the siege?" Then, the citizens, tricked by his cunning, quickly removed them from that place. Then, the city was quickly captured by them. 

Wishing to conquer Nanda's country, they surrounded Nanda's city. Then, due to his dwindling merit, Nanda requested a passage through the Dharma gate from Chanakya. He said, "Take whatever you can carry in one chariot and go out of the city without fear." Nanda, placing his two wives, one daughter, and his treasure in the chariot, left the city. Chandragupta and the others came to enter the city. Then, Nanda's daughter, filled with love, saw Chandragupta. Then, Nanda said, "O daughter! If this man pleases you, then accept him." Having been told this, she was about to climb onto Chandragupta's chariot, but the chariot wheels broke. Chandragupta, knowing her to be

Chanakya - Along with the mountain. There was a girl there, Nanda fed her poison slowly and unevenly all her life. Seeing her, the mountain, filled with poison, embraced her. Filled with poison, he cried out to the moon - "Do something immediately". He was ready to retaliate, but Chanakya stopped him with a raised eyebrow and taught him, 
"
A friend who is equal in worth, equal in strength, who knows the heart, who is determined, who can take half the kingdom, he who does not kill, is killed. || 1 || 
Then the mountain perished, leaving only his name. His kingdom came under the control of Chandragupta. Then the Nanda sons committed theft in Chandragupta's kingdom. Then Chanakya searched for another protector. While wandering, he went to the house of Ladahvakuvinda. He saw him throwing fire into the houses of the Morkotakas. Chanakya asked him, "What are you doing?" Kuvindu said - "I am throwing fire into the burrows to kill these wicked Morkotakas, who are the enemies of my sons, along with their families." Hearing his words, knowing him to be strong and determined, Chanakya appointed him as the head of the city by Chandragupta. Thus, the Mauryan kingdom became free from obstacles.

Once upon a time, the great Lord Mahavira was wandering. The world-worshipped one arrived in that city and stayed there. || 1 || 
Hearing that the Lord had arrived, the mobile Kalpa tree, the king of the श्रेणिकs, came there, filled with joy. || 2 || 
The world-teacher, seated in his place among the gods and others, began to preach the Dharma, which destroys evil. || 3 || 
Then a man with a leprous body came and bowed down. He sat down near the Lord, like a crow near a lamp. || 4 || 
Then, with his own saliva, he washed the feet of the Lord. He worshipped them with sandalwood, without any fear. || 5 || 
Seeing this, the श्रेणिक king became angry and thought, "This man should be killed. He is the most wicked, as he dared to touch the Lord of the world." || 6 || 
Meanwhile, the Jina asked the leper, "Should he die or live?" When the श्रेणिक king said, "He should die," || 7 || 
Abhayakumara said, "Let him live or die. Even Kalasaukarika said, 'Do not live, do not die.'" || 8 || 
The king was enraged by the words, "Let him die," spoken against the Jina. He got up from his seat and ordered his soldiers, "Seize him." || 9 || 
After the sermon, the leper bowed to Mahavira and got up. He was attacked by the श्रेणिक's soldiers, like a boar by Kiratas. || 10 || 
In their very sight, he instantly assumed a divine form. He rose up in the sky, mocking the sun. || 11 || 
[Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Original Verse - 30, in वृत्त, Internal Verse 5 to 15] Then the श्रेणिक king, in his anger, said, "This is the misfortune of the Lord. What is the misfortune of others?" || 12 || 
Then the Lord said, "Why are you still standing here? Quickly go to liberation

## Chapter 234: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**Verse 15:** While alive, he [the king] would have established the religion of the Jivas, and in the highest heaven, he would have been dead. "Live, die, Jiva," thus he spoke to him [the king] without fear.

**Verse 16:** While alive, he [the king] was devoted to sin, and after death, he would go to the seventh hell. The Time-and-Prosperity-Maker said to him, "Do not live, do not die."

**Verse 17:** Hearing this, the king, bowing to the Lord, said, "O Lord, the Lord of the world, how can I go to hell?"

**Verse 18:** The Lord said, "In the past, you were a king. You were bound by karma to hell, and therefore you will surely go there."

**Verse 19:** "The fruits of good and bad deeds are bound by past karma. We must experience them, we cannot do otherwise."

**Verse 20:** "In the twenty-fourth cycle of births and deaths, you will be the king named Padma-Nabha. Do not be distressed by this."

**Verse 21:** The king said, "O Lord, is there any way to escape hell, like a blind man escaping a well?"

**Verse 22:** The Lord said, "With devotion, give alms to the virtuous, especially to the Brahmanas, and if you give alms to Kapila with joy,

**Verse 23:** "Or if you free the birds from the Time-and-Prosperity-Maker, then you will be freed from hell, O king, there is no other way."

**Verse 24:** Accepting this teaching as a jewel in his heart, he bowed to the glorious Mahavira and went to his own home.

**Verse 25:** The king, filled with faith, requested Kapila, "Give alms to the virtuous, I will make you rich."

**Verse 26:** Kapila said, "If you make me all of gold, or even kill me, I will not do this."

**Verse 27:** The Time-and-Prosperity-Maker also said to the king, "Free the birds, I will give you wealth. You are a greedy merchant."

**Verse 28:** "What harm is there in the birds, since humans live? I will never abandon them," said the Time-and-Prosperity-Maker.

**Verse 29:** "How will he do this bird business?" The king threw him into a well and kept him there day and night.

**Verse 30:** Then the king went to the Lord and said, "O Lord, the Time-and-Prosperity-Maker has abandoned the birds for a day and night."

**Verse 31:** The Omniscient said, "O king, even in the well, he killed five hundred buffaloes, made of clay, himself."

**Verse 32:** Going there, the king saw this with his own eyes, and then he said, "Alas, my past karma! It is not otherwise, O Lord."

**Verse 33:** Every day, he killed five hundred buffaloes, and the Time-and-Prosperity-Maker's heap of sin grew higher and higher.

**Verse 34:** He also suffered terrible diseases, caused by his terrible sins, which led him to the hell of suffering.

**Verse 35:** "Alas, father! Alas, mother!" he cried out in pain, like a pig being slaughtered.

**Verse 36:** He suffered needles in his eyes,

Even so, to please him, make the opposite of his senses. A medicine for a sick person would be a foul smell. ||39|| Then, having come, the gentle one fed him bitter and pungent things. He gave him very hot water, and he made him eat hot, cooked, and undigested food. ||40|| He smeared him all over with a lot of excrement. He made him sleep on a bed full of thorns. ||41|| He made him listen to harsh sounds like the creaking of a wheel. He showed him terrible forms of demons, ghosts, and skeletons. ||42|| Pleased by these, he said to his son, "For a long time, I have enjoyed delicious food, cold water, a soft bed, and fragrant ointments. ||43|| Sounds are nectar for the ears, and forms are a single pleasure for the eyes. ||44|| Have I been cheated of happiness for a long time by your devotion?" ||45|| Hearing this, the gentle one thought, "In this very birth, I have become a fool. What will be the terrible fruit of my sin in hell?" ||46|| Thinking thus, the gentle one died and attained a terrible place in the seventh hell, called "A-prati-sthana". ||46|| [Original verses - 30 in the Vrutta, internal verses 107 to 128] 41. Laughter and contemplation in the Srimad Bhava Vijay, composed by Sri Uttara Adhyayana Vrutta, the story of Sri Chandrudra Acharya's disciple. In Ujjayini, in the Nandana-like garden, where the bath is taken, Chandrudra, the Suri, with his followers, gathered. ||1|| He was very angry, seeing the faults of the excessive and insufficient actions of his followers. ||2|| It is very difficult for me alone to restrain so many. But excessive anger does not bring about my own good. ||3|| Thinking thus, the Suri sat alone, for the sake of true contemplation. ||4|| (Pair) He left the hot place for his disciples, who were devoted to their studies and contemplation. ||4|| And from there, a young man from Ujjayini, the son of a businessman, came, with his body smeared with saffron, a newly married man, with his friends. ||5|| Seeing the holy men, he bowed to them with mockery, and said, "O Lord, tell me the religion that brings happiness." ||6|| Knowing that he was a jester, they did not say anything to him. Then, again, he spoke to them with mockery, without any scriptures. ||7|| "I have been abandoned by my wife, due to bad luck, and I have renounced my household life. Please, grant me a vow that will be a savior from the ocean of existence." ||8|| "This rogue deceives us with his witty words again and again. Let him be properly examined, and think about it," they said. ||9|| "We are not under the control of a guru, we ourselves give initiation and other things. You are now our guru, for the sake of the vow that you have taken refuge in." ||10|| Hearing this, his companions then went to the Suri. He bowed to him and said, with a mocking smile, with folded hands. ||11|| "I am broken by household affairs, and I am attached to your lotus feet. Please, initiate me, so that I may live happily." ||12|| Hearing his words, with a mocking smile, the Suri said, "If you want a vow, then bring me ashes quickly." ||13||

## Chapter 236: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Then, a well-wisher brought him ashes. The sage, taking them in his own arms, made a vow with a tearful eye. ||14||

Seeing this, the two companions were distressed and said, "Friend! Flee immediately, so that we may go to our destination." ||15||

He, being close to attaining perfection, thought, "This is a minor karma." How can I go home, having accepted the vow with my own words? ||16||

Even if spoken in jest, the words spoken by a wise man, how can they be otherwise, like letters carved in stone? ||17||

I have gained this vow through jest, therefore it must be protected. Who abandons a burning fire, when it has come close without effort? ||18||

Reflecting on the virtue of his intention, the wise man accepted it. Then, the two companions, filled with sorrow, went to their destination. ||19||

Then, the hero addressed the sage, "O Bhagavan! My companions will release me from the Shramanya vow, so I will go elsewhere." ||20||

"This great man, even if he goes in disguise, will be recognized by the Yajnas. Only we two are worthy of going." ||21||

The sage said, "If that is so, then look at the path. We will go as the night falls." He also looked at him and agreed. ||22||

Then, in the dead of night, the sage, accompanied by his new disciple, set out. The disciple was told by the guru to go ahead, and he went ahead. ||23||

Due to his old age, the sage stumbled and fell on a stone in the night. He was filled with pain and anger. ||24||

"Oh, wicked disciple! The right path is not to be deviated from," he said, and struck the disciple on the head with his staff, making him bleed. ||25||

Even though his head was split open and blood was flowing, the disciple did not speak or get angry, but instead thought, "These great souls are dwelling happily in their own path. I have been made a victim of suffering by my own foolishness!" ||26||

"Disciples are always a source of happiness for the guru, some are wise and virtuous. But I, from the very first day, have been a source of sorrow for my guru." ||27||

"May the guru not suffer further pain from stones or anything else. With effort, he thought, and slowly he moved." ||29||

Thus, the pure-hearted, equal-minded, great soul, while walking, attained Kevala Jnana in the night itself. ||30||

Then, when the morning dawned and the sun rose, the sage saw his disciple with a blood-stained head. ||31||

Then, the sage, with a peaceful mind and a calm heart, thought, "Oh! This new disciple has excellent patience." ||32||

"Even though he was struck with a staff in a fit of anger, he did not show any sign of anger or distress." ||33||

"Even an old practitioner, who knows the faults of anger, who has attained the position of an Acharya, is overcome by strong anger! How shameful!" ||34||

"This vow, which I have protected for so long with great difficulty, has become useless. It has been destroyed by my anger." ||35||

"By cultivating the right thoughts, he attained Kevala Jnana. Even a harsh guru can have disciples who are virtuous, humble, and worthy of respect." ||36||

He was like the father of the people. ||2|| And in the city of Ayodhya, in the Ikshvaku dynasty, which is a part of the Aditya dynasty, ||3|| after many kings had attained liberation, and many had gone to heaven, ||4|| after an uncountable number of twenty, a king named Vijaya was born. His beloved wife was Himachula. They had two sons, Vajra Bahu and Purandara. ||5|| And in the city of Abhinagapura, there was a king named Bhavahana. His wife was Chudamani, and their daughter was Manorama. ||6|| Vajra Bahu, having reached his youth, married her. He was like a bright ray of light, like the Rohini star. ||7|| With devotion, he took Manorama with him, accompanied by his friend Udayasundara. He set out for his own city. ||8|| As he was going, he saw a great being, radiating with the light of his austerities. He was like the sun rising from the Vasant mountain, or the Udayachala mountain. ||9|| He saw a great sage named Gunasagara, who was engaged in austerities, like a father who is looking after his child. ||10|| Pair. || Seeing him, Vajra Bahu was filled with joy, like a peacock seeing a cloud. He stopped his chariot and said, ||11|| "Oh, what a great soul this is! He is a venerable sage. He is like a wish-fulfilling gem, seen by me through great merit." ||12|| Udayasundara said, "My dear prince, what do you want? Do you want to become an ascetic?" Vajra Bahu replied, "My mind is set on it." ||13|| Udayasundara said, "If you have the desire, then don't delay. I will be your companion." ||14|| The prince replied, like the ocean, "Don't abandon this agreement, my friend. I will also be yours." ||15|| The prince, as if overcoming the delusion of his chariot, climbed down and went to the Vasant mountain, accompanied by Udayasundara and others. ||16|| Vajra Bahu then said to Bhavahana's son, "My friend, don't make me an ascetic today. This is not a joke." ||17|| "We were joking. What is the fault in that? Joking is not always true, like a white song." ||18|| "You will be my helper in all my troubles. Don't abandon our family's desires, even in this difficult situation." ||19|| "The auspicious bangle is still on your hand. How can you suddenly abandon the fruits of marriage and enjoyment?" ||20|| "Manorama, deprived of the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, will live like a blade of grass, abandoned by you." ||21|| Vajra Bahu then said to Udayasundara, "My dear friend, the fruit of a mortal birth is the virtue of character." ||22|| "Even our joking was based on truth, like the pearls in the ocean, which are like the stars and the clouds." ||23|| "If your sister is noble, she will accept this asceticism. If not, then

## Chapter 238: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager

**25.**  "Accept my vow, you too should not abandon us. The duty of the Kshatriyas is to protect their own lineage."

**26.**  Thus, having informed him of the rising, Vajraबाहु made arrangements. He was like the ocean of the jewels of virtues, the great sage Gunasagar.

**27.**  At the end of his vow, Vajraबाहु took up the wandering life. The rising, Manorama, and the twenty-five Kumaras.

**28.**  Hearing of Vajraबाहु's renunciation, Vijayabhupati, the king, felt detachment, saying, "Even if he is a child, I am not."

**29.**  Then Vijay, placing his son Purandara on the throne, took up the vow at the side of the sage, the destroyer of the delusion of Nirvana.

**30.**  Purandara, too, placed his son, born from the womb of the earth, on his throne, the glorious Kirtidhara, and became a renunciant, worthy of offerings.

**[Seventh Chapter, Fourth Canto, Verses 1 to 30]**

**43.**  The story of Marubhuti and Kamatha in the **Trishatishalaka Purushacharitra** (The Story of the Sixty-Three Illustrious Persons), in the section on **Dveshadhyana** (Contemplation of Hatred).

**1.**  In the region of this Jambudvipa, there is a city called Potanapura, new like a fresh piece of land.

**2.**  It is frequented by royal swans, a beautiful place with a flag of auspiciousness. It is like a lotus petal in the water, an ornament of the earth.

**3.**  There, like the celestial beings of Sri, they shone with prosperity, with great generosity like the Kalpadruma (wish-fulfilling tree) and its siblings.

**4.**  There was a pond called Amaravati, belonging to Amaravati, a pond that was beyond the reach of words, a great treasure.

**5.**  There was a king named Arvind, like a lotus at the feet of the Arhat. He was like the lord of prosperity for the people of Arnas.

**6.**  He was unique among the wicked, just as he was unique among the wise. He was like the courage of the wealthy, just as he was like the fame of the successful.

**7.**  Just as wealth is distributed among the poor, the helpless, and the suffering, he, too, distributed it among the people day and night.

**8.**  The king had a minister named Vishvabhuti, a learned man who understood the principles of livelihood and sustenance, a great follower of the teachings.

**9.**  Kamatha and Marubhuti, born from the womb of Anuddhara, were both his sons, the elder and the younger.

**10.**  Kamatha had a wife named Varuna, a follower of the same dharma, while Marubhuti had a wife named Vasundhara, beautiful and charming.

**11.**  Both were learned in the scriptures and both were capable of earning a living. They were both affectionate towards each other, a source of joy for their father.

**12.**  Remembering the five supreme beings, with a concentrated mind, Vishvabhuti became a great sage, a protector of dharma.

**13.**  His wife, Anuddhara, was afflicted by the fever of separation. She was consumed by grief, her body withered, and she died while offering salutations.

##  Chapter 240

Seeing the open window, he went to sleep, overcome by drowsiness.  He, desiring to see their evil deeds, went to the village where Marubhuti had gone.  The two, Vasundhara and Kamatha, remained unaware for a long time, blinded by their desires.  Marubhuti, standing there, saw what was to be seen.  Fearing the censure of the people, he did not act against them.  Going to the king, he told him everything.  The king, intolerant of evil conduct, ordered his protection in this way:  "This man, the son of the priest, is a wicked character.  He should be banished, mounted on a donkey, with ridicule."  They, too, mounted him on a donkey, with a ringing, discordant drum, painted with metallic colors, and banished him.  Looking down, Kamatha, watched by the townspeople, was unable to resist, and went to the forest with sorrow.  There, in the presence of the holy ascetic, Shiva, he began to practice austerities, a young boy in the forest.  Marubhuti, instructing him, said, "What is this you have done?  When you told the king about your brother's misconduct, you said, 'This is my fault, great though it is, even greater than his.  Going to him, I will now forgive my elder brother.'  Thinking thus, and asked by the king, though he was being restrained by him, he went to Kamatha and fell at his feet.  Remembering the previous ridicule, Kamatha, in anger, picked up a stone and threw it at his bowed head.  The stone, hitting him, fell to the ground.  Again, Kamatha picked up the stone and threw it at him, as if he were in hell.  The pain of the blow, with intense meditation, caused him to die.  He became the lord of the Vindhya mountains, like the Vindhyas with their high peaks.

##  Chapter 2010_02

**Miscellaneous on the Rejection of the Sick** 

The Lord also went to the village of Shanmaninaama.  He remained outside, with his body in a state of outward inactivity, absorbed in meditation.  The karma that was to be experienced, earned by him in his previous birth as Vishnu, was then revealed.  He was bound by the punishment of being thrown on a bed of thorns.  The life of the bed-maker was Gopal, who was there.  Leaving the bulls near his master, he went to milk the cows.  The bulls, roaming freely, entered the forest.  Soon, Gopal returned, and seeing the bulls missing, he said to his master, "Lord, where are my bulls?  Why don't you tell me, O sage?  Do you not hear my words, or are your ears useless?"  The Lord, extremely angry at his insolence, threw a shard of a conch shell into his ears.  The shards, struck by him, joined together, becoming one whole shard, as if they were a wheel.  Thinking, "Let no one break these two pegs," Gopal, with his intelligence, cut off the outer part of the pegs.

Chapter:-2 Collection of Examples
241
Even though the karma of the lost, false, etc. was like a thorn, it was a part of the thorn of the scriptures. He remained unshaken, and due to his good thoughts, he attained the middle path, free from sin. ||9|| For the purpose of atonement, the Lord went to the house of the merchant Siddhartha. The Lord went there, but he was not repaid with devotion. ||10|| The physician Kharaka, a friend and beloved of Siddhartha, came there earlier. Seeing the Lord, the sharp-minded one said this. ||11|| Oh, the form of the Lord is complete with all the marks. But it is marked by dullness, as if it has a thorn. ||12|| Siddhartha, out of excitement, said, "If that is so, then explain it. Where exactly does the thorn reside in the body of the Lord?" ||13|| The physician, seeing the entire body of his master skillfully, saw the nails in the ears and showed them to Siddhartha. ||14|| Siddhartha then said, "Due to some slander by a cowardly person, who was not afraid even of hell, I did a terrible deed." ||15|| "Tell me, my friend, what was the sin done by him? Try your best, O great-minded one, to remove the thorn from the Lord!" ||16|| "The thorn in the ears of my master is causing me great pain. I cannot tolerate the delay in this matter, even if I have to give up all my wealth." ||17|| "I believe that by removing the thorns from the ears of Vishwanath, the great ocean of beings will be saved." ||18|| The physician said, "This Lord is capable of destroying the enemies of the world. He endured that sinner, not out of inability, but for the destruction of karma." ||19|| "How can this one be treated, who is indifferent even to his own body? He who is greedy for the destruction of karma, considers pain to be good." ||20|| Siddhartha said, "What is the logic in your words now? It is not the time for these words, the Lord is not to be treated." ||21|| Thus, the Lord, indifferent to both of them, went away. He stood outside in the garden, absorbed in good thoughts. ||22|| Siddhartha and Kharaka, taking medicines, etc., went to the Lord in the garden with haste. ||23|| Placing the Lord in a vessel of oil, they anointed him with oil. Then, with strong carriers, they began to massage him. ||24|| By massaging the joints with strong men, the nails in the ears were pulled out simultaneously with pincers. ||25|| The two nails, with blood, came out of the ear holes. The remaining pain, like the karma, was directly experienced by the Lord. ||26|| As the Lord experienced pain due to the pulling out of the nails, he roared like a terrible lion, as if struck by a thunderbolt. ||27|| The earth did not shake due to the greatness of the Lord, even though he made that sound. For those who are not worthy, even if they are harmed, they do not deserve to harm others. ||28|| After removing the thorns and bowing to the Lord, Siddhartha and Kharaka went home. ||29|| They had good intentions, even though they caused pain to their master. Both of them became recipients of the glory of the heavenly world. ||30|| Gopal, with evil intentions, caused pain to his master, and he was born as a recipient of the seven earthly miseries. ||31||

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

**44.  The story of Brahmadutta in the commentary on the Sri Upadeshamala, in the section on harsh meditation.**

When Brahmaraja died, his wife Chulini, who had a long name, was destroyed along with his friend.  Recognizing this, the minister Dhanumantri brought up Brahmadutta, his son.  Seeing the gathering of crows and cuckoos, he gave Brahmadutta a companion, his own son, Varadhanu.  Knowing this somehow, she thought, "He will be an obstacle to my enjoyment.  Therefore, I will kill this Brahmadutta."  To wash away the slander of the people, she brought forward a certain girl, entered the previously prepared house of fire, and gave him the fire unnoticed.  The minister, using a previously prepared method, expelled him with a pit in the ground, and he went to a place and time suitable for him.  || 44.  The story of Yugabahuu in the commentary on the Sri Upadeshamala-Pushpamala-Granthabridhavritta.

**There is a city named Sundasan, which is the best of the Jain community in Avanti.**  It is a very beautiful and pleasant place, and it is very large. || 1 ||

**There is a king named Maniraho, who is like a jewel, a treasure, and a sea of water.**  He is very beautiful, has a beautiful voice, and is very generous. || 2 ||

**His younger sister was named Yugabahuu, and she was very beautiful.**  Her name was Mayanareha, and she was very virtuous. || 3 ||

**Her beauty was like a blazing fire, and she was very attractive.**  The people of the city thought that she was very beautiful. || 4 ||

**Maniraho, thinking of her in his heart, was very sad.**  He thought, "I will kill her with arrows." || 5 ||

**"I must take her, I will entice her."  People do good and bad deeds because of their attachment to worldly pleasures.** || 6 ||

**She was like a flower, fruit, and a beautiful woman, and she was very attractive.**  She was very pure and she was very attractive. || 7 ||

**One day, two people came to her and said, "O beautiful one, the king is very fond of you."** || 8 ||

**"I want to enjoy her, I want to rule over all the kingdoms."  Mayanareha, who was devoted to the Jain teachings, said this.** || 9 ||

**Even a good man does not desire another man's wife.**  But to desire many women is a great sin. || 10 ||

**Purity is the first virtue of women.  If she does not have that, then what other virtues does she have?**  What good is a woman who does not have purity? || 11 ||

**The queen of the Yuvraj was very beautiful and she was very powerful.**  "May this not happen to me, may my purity not be broken." || 12 ||

**Where there is a fire of time, youth, and desire, who enjoys doing good deeds?** || 13 ||

**"If I were to be born again, I would not go to the world of women."  There are many women, but I am not attracted to any of them.** || 14 ||

**You have enjoyed the pleasures of the world, you have enjoyed the three worlds.**  You have gone to hell, you have been bound by your actions. || 1

Chapter-2: Collection of Examples
243
Those who abstain from evil deeds, and cultivate a sense of deep joy in their minds, they are not easily tempted by worldly pleasures, and they are often steadfast in their vows. ||16||
This is what the two sages have said, and this is what the wise ones understand. But this one is not steadfast, he is caught in the net of sensual desires. ||17||
Even those who have heard these words, and who are wise and intelligent, they are not able to control their minds, if they are attached to worldly pleasures. ||18||
He thinks, "I am a fool, I am caught in the trap of my own desires, I am unable to free myself from this bondage, I am defeated by my own weakness." ||19||
Thinking this, he breaks his vows, and he is overcome by his desires. In the meantime, the spring season arrives, a season of great beauty. ||20||
Thus,
The air is filled with the sweet fragrance of many flowers, and the bees hum a sweet melody. The hearts of men are filled with joy, and the world is reborn. ||1||
And,
The fragrance of camphor and sandalwood, the sweet scent of cardamom and cloves, the blue waves of the ocean, the playful dance of the sunbeams, the sound of the conch shell, the dance of the peacock, the fire of desire, all these are carried by the gentle breeze. ||2||
The sound of the lute and the flute, the sweet songs of the birds, the beautiful women swaying in the breeze, the sound of the conch shell, the sweet melody of the cuckoo, all these fill the heart with joy. ||3||
And,
The young men and women embrace each other, and the trees are adorned with flowers. The young men and women are filled with joy, and the world is reborn. ||4||
The young women are adorned with garlands of flowers, and the trees are filled with blossoms. The trees are filled with the sweet scent of the rain, and the world is reborn. ||5||
The young men and women gaze at each other, and the trees are filled with blossoms. The trees are filled with the sweet scent of the rain, and the world is reborn. ||6||
All these things are beautiful, but they are fleeting. They are like the flowers of the spring, which bloom for a short time and then wither away. ||7||
The wind blows through the trees, and the leaves rustle like bells. The dust dances in the air, and the world is reborn. ||8||
The women are filled with sorrow, and the flowers wither away. The fire of desire burns within them, and their eyes are filled with tears. ||9||
The bees do not care for the beauty of the flowers, they are only interested in their nectar. They are not attracted by beauty, but by virtue. ||10||

**Chapter: The Rejection of the Sick**

Where the fragrance of the blooming Machkunda flowers, like golden, jeweled, and fragrant blossoms, spreads endlessly, there is a beautiful garden. || 11 ||

Many flowers and fragrant plants, with their sweet scents, are scattered there. Red cloves and cardamom, and date palms stand tall. || 12 ||

There are many beautiful trees, each with its own unique beauty. At this time, the garden is filled with the sweet sounds of birds and the buzzing of bees. || 13 ||

Birds sing their melodies, and peacocks dance with their vibrant plumage. Flowers bloom in full glory, and the sweet calls of cuckoos fill the air. || 14 ||

The earth trembles with the sound of footsteps, and the sweet hum of bees fills the air. Fruit-laden trees stand tall, and the sweet taste of honey fills the air. || 15 ||

**The Story**

In this beautiful garden, filled with many pleasures, a young man named Jugabahū, with a beautiful face, was enjoying himself. There were many beautiful women, adorned with jewels, who were enjoying themselves with him. They were all lost in their pleasures, forgetting everything else. || 16 ||

The gardener, holding a bunch of fragrant flowers, approached Jugabahū and said, "My lord, please listen to my words. This garden is beautiful, but it is not yours. You are not the owner of this garden." || 17 ||

Jugabahū, with his beautiful eyes and charming smile, replied, "This garden is beautiful, and I am enjoying myself here. What is wrong with that?" || 18 ||

The gardener said, "My lord, this is not the time for enjoyment. The king is coming here, and he will be angry if he sees you here." || 19 ||

Jugabahū, lost in his pleasures, did not listen to the gardener's warnings. He continued to enjoy himself with the women. || 20 ||

The gardener, seeing that Jugabahū was not listening, left him and went to inform the king. The king, hearing the news, was furious. He immediately ordered his soldiers to arrest Jugabahū. || 21 ||

The soldiers, armed with swords, rushed into the garden and surrounded Jugabahū. They were about to attack him when the gardener intervened. He pleaded with the king to spare Jugabahū's life. || 22 ||

The king, seeing the gardener's plea, stopped his soldiers. He then turned to Jugabahū and said, "You are a fool! You have forgotten your duty and are indulging in pleasures. You have no respect for the king or the law. You will be punished for your actions." || 23 ||

Jugabahū, realizing his mistake, fell at the king's feet and begged for forgiveness. He promised to never repeat his mistake. The king, seeing his remorse, pardoned him. || 24 ||

The king then turned to the gardener and said, "You have done well. You have saved this young man's life. You are a true servant of the king." || 25 ||

Whatever karma a living being performs in this world, through food, that karma must be atoned for by him, with the help of the right cause and the right conditions. ||26||
If you have committed any sin, even if it is a small one, you will have to suffer for it in the next life. ||27||
Therefore, O valiant one! Take refuge in the Arhats and follow their teachings. Abandon pride and anger, and be kind to all beings. ||28||
Speak gently to those who are angry, and be forgiving to all beings. ||29||
Remember the Arhats, the gods, the gurus, the saints, and the Jinas, and think of them as your guides. ||30||
Refrain from harming living beings, from stealing, from sexual misconduct, and from lying. ||31||
Follow the eighteen principles of conduct, and be mindful of your thoughts and actions. ||32||
Whoever does not perform the five prostrations at the end of the day, and who kills ten living beings, will be reborn in hell. ||33||
Your mother, father, friends, children, wife, and relatives are all your companions in this life. ||34||
By remembering the suffering of hell, and by being free from attachment, you will be able to overcome all obstacles. ||35||
It is difficult to find the jewel of the Jina's teachings. Therefore, with a single-minded devotion, accept its fruits. ||36||
By offering flowers, water, and incense, and by bowing your head in reverence, you will be able to purify yourself. ||37||
By following the path of non-violence, you will be reborn in the heavenly realms. ||38||
44. In the book "Shriaavashyakaniyuktihaaribhadriyavrittau Shraavikaakhyaanakah", there is a story about a woman who was a follower of the wrong path. She was cooking food, and she was very angry. She wanted to kill someone. She saw a snake, and she thought that she could use it to kill someone. She took the snake and put it in a pot. She then went to the market to buy some flowers. She thought that if someone tried to eat her food, she would kill them with the snake. She went to the market and bought some flowers. She then went back home and put the flowers in the pot. She then went to bed. She was very tired. She fell asleep. She had a dream. In her dream, she saw a god. The god told her that she should not kill anyone. He told her that she should be kind to all beings. She woke up from her dream. She was very scared. She realized that she had been wrong. She decided to change her ways. She became a follower of the Jina's teachings. She became a good person. She lived a happy life.

## The Story of Somila

**45. This story is found in the *Upadeshamala* under the headings of *Fear*, *Instruction*, and *Circumstances*.**

In Dvaravati, Krishna's mother Devaki was nursing her son. A woman, seeing this, felt a pang of longing, thinking, "How fortunate are those women whose sons suckle at their breasts, their faces filled with innocent delight, their small hands grasping at their mothers' breasts. I, on the other hand, am unfortunate, for I have not been blessed with this." Krishna, seeing her sadness, asked her, "Mother, what is this?" She then told him her thoughts. He reassured her, saying, "I will fulfill your desires." He then worshipped the Lord. The Lord said, "Your son will be born as a celestial being, but due to his past karma, he will not stay in your home for long." Devaki, hearing this, accepted it. 

Then, a dream of an elephant foretold the birth of a child. He was born in due course and named Gajasukumar. He grew up and was married by his parents to the daughter of a Brahmin named Somila. Gajasukumar, however, considered the world to be like a magic trick, and he found worldly pleasures to be like a prison. He lived in his home for a while, only because of his parents' wishes. Later, he revealed his true intentions to them. They understood his desire and, with the help of Krishna, freed him from his worldly attachments. He then went to the foot of the Lord Arishtanemi, where he learned various skills. 

One day, Gajasukumar was found dead in a cremation ground in Dvaravati. Somila, who had come there by chance, saw him. He was enraged, thinking, "This wicked man has married my daughter and abandoned her." He then took some earth and covered Gajasukumar's head with it. He then threw burning coals on him, thinking, "This wicked man will surely go to hell for what he has done to me." As the fire burned, a white light, like a helper, appeared. The four karmas that bind us were burned away, and Gajasukumar attained pure knowledge. He then attained the state of *Saileeshi* (a state of liberation) and his lifespan ended. He then attained the supreme abode. 

On the second day, Vishnu came to pay his respects to the Lord. He was greeted by the Lord and the sages. Vishnu then asked, "Where is Gajasukumar?" The Lord told him that Gajasukumar had fulfilled his purpose. Vishnu asked, "How?" The Lord then told him the story of Gajasukumar. Vishnu asked, "Who did this?" The Lord said, "The one who, upon seeing you, will split his head." Somila, upon entering, saw Vishnu and, filled with fear, ran away. His head split open due to the intense fear he felt upon seeing Krishna. 

**28, 42, 46. This story of Chandrapradhyota is found in the commentary on the *Upadeshamala* under the headings of *War*, *Laughter*, and *Form*.**

In the city of Susumaranagara, Chandrapradhyota, the king, was enraged when his daughter Angaravati was rejected and expelled by a wandering ascetic. He sent a messenger to the ascetic, but the messenger was also rejected. The king, filled with anger, besieged the city. He was distressed and asked his astrologer, "What will happen now?" The astrologer said, "I will tell you after I have taken the omens." He then went to take the omens. He

He was present, the root of that was gone somehow, so he said, "Don't be afraid," the other also heard that word, it was said by the king, taking its meaning, he became firm, giving the descent, he took Chandrapradhyota, he brought him home and said, "What is to be done now?" He said, "Do what is appropriate for those who have come to your house?" Then, considering that those who are subdued are compassionate, he gave him Angaravati. He wandered with her in the city, seeing the small amount of goods, he asked her, "How was I taken?" She said, "By the power of destiny," he said, "How?" Then she told him the story of the Muni. Once, she showed him the Varattaka Muni, then he said to him in front of the people, "A destiny-based tortoise! Greetings to you." Then, when he was asked, "Where did I use destiny?" The Muni said, "From birth, in my own offenses! It is known, child! Don't be afraid of death." Then, he felt remorse, gave advice, and went back. 47. The example of the minister Shakatala is mentioned in the Sriparishishtaparva, which is about self-praise meditation.

Kalpaka, born again with many sons, a treasure of wisdom. For a long time, he followed the business of Nanda's seal. 1. In Nanda's lineage, in time, seven Nanda kings were born. Their ministers were the great ones of the Kalpaka lineage. 2. Then, the king of the three-part earth, like a husband to prosperity. Nanda, the ninth king, was born, who had uprooted the roots of his enemies. 3. Vishankata, a dwelling for prosperity, Asankata, a chariot for wisdom. Shakatala, of the Kalpaka lineage, became his minister. 4. He had a Lakshmi named Lakshmiwati, beautiful like Lakshmi herself. She was a virtuous woman, adorned with good character. 5. Their eldest son was adorned with humility. He was wise, strong, and handsome like the moon. 6. Their younger son was devoted to devotion, Sriyaka, Nanda's son. He was gentle, like the heart of Nanda, and had sandalwood on his head. 7. There was a prostitute named Kosha, beautiful in form and prosperity. She was a medicine for life, who had subdued the minds of the world. 8. Enjoying various pleasures, day and night. Sthulabhadra lived in her house for twelve years, with his mind on her. 9. Sriyaka was a protector of his body, a source of great confidence. He was like a second heart to Nanda, the king of the earth. 10. There was a wise man named Vararuchi, a leader of the best Brahmanas. He was the jewel of poets, debaters, and grammarians. 11. He was engaged in writing new verses every day, a hundred and eight in number, in the presence of the king, a wise man. 12. The minister never praised him as a false seer. Even though he was praised, the king did not give him any satisfaction. 13. Knowing the reason for not getting a gift, Vararuchi. He began to worship the wife of his minister. 14. Pleased with her, she asked him what he wanted, he said this. "Let your husband praise my poetry in front of the king." 15. She told her husband about it, he said, "How can I praise the words of a false seer?" 16.

## Chapter 248: The Story of the Rejection of the Eager One

The minister agreed to the king's request. The eagerness of the blind, women, children, and fools is indeed strong. ||17||

The king, sitting before the king, read a poem by Vararuchi. The minister, praising it, said, "Oh, what a beautiful saying!" ||18||

The king then gave him one hundred and eight dinars. The words of a king, even if they are not favorable, are still to be lived by. ||19||

When one hundred and eight dinars were given every day, the minister asked the king, "What is this being given for?" ||20||

The king replied, "Minister, I am giving it to him because of your praise. If we were to give it ourselves, wouldn't we have given it long ago?" ||21||

The minister said, "My lord, I did not create any praise for him. I was praising the poems of others at that time." ||22||

"He is reading other people's poems in front of us, claiming them as his own. Is this true?" the king asked. ||23||

"I will show you in the morning, even young girls can recite these poems," the minister said. ||24||

Yaks, Yakshas, Bhutas, Bhutas, and Venas, seven wise daughters of the minister, were named Rene. ||25||

The eldest of them could recite the poems once, while the others could recite them twice, thrice, and so on, according to their age. ||26||

The minister brought them to the king on the second day. He arranged them in a way that they were separated from the one who was rejected. ||27||

Vararuchi, having composed one hundred and eight verses himself, recited them in the order of seniority. ||28||

The king, angered by Vararuchi, stopped the gift. The methods of ministers are capable of both punishment and favor. ||29||

Vararuchi then went and made a device in the Ganges water. He put one hundred and eight dinars wrapped in cloth inside it. ||30||

In the morning, he praised the Ganges and then approached the device with a strong hand. The dinars flew out of it and fell into his hand. ||31||

He did this every day, and the people were amazed. Hearing this from the people, the king praised the minister. ||32||

"If this is true, then we will see it ourselves tomorrow morning," the king said. The minister agreed to this. ||33||

The king, having been taught, sent a messenger there in the evening. The messenger, disguised as a bird, remained hidden in the reeds. ||34||

Vararuchi then went and secretly placed a bundle of one hundred and eight dinars in the Mandakini water and went home. ||35||

The messenger, taking the bundle of dinars as if it were his life, respectfully presented it to the minister in secret. ||36||

The minister, secretly taking the bundle of dinars, went to the Ganges with the king. Vararuchi arrived there at that time. ||37||

Seeing the king, who was eager to see him, Vararuchi, being arrogant and full of pride, began to praise the Ganges in detail. ||38||

When Vararuchi was praising the Ganges, he accidentally moved the device. The bundle of dinars flew out and fell into his lap. ||39||

He searched for the bundle with his hand in the water. He stood there silently, a cunning, deceitful, and silent fool. ||40||

Thus the great minister said, "What is given to you is not the Jahnavi. You are searching for the property that has been entrusted to you, why?" ||41||
Pointing to it, he said, "Take this, it is your property."
He gave the bundle of dinars to Vararuchi's hand. ||42||
With that bundle of dinars, he, like one with a knot in his heart, suffered unbearable pain for ten months. ||43||
"To deceive the people, he throws it away in the evening, and in the morning he takes it back," said the secretary to the king. ||44||
"Good, this is a good plan," said the chief minister.
The king, with eyes filled with wonder, went to his house. ||45||
Vararuchi, filled with anger, thought of revenge.
He asked the servants and others about the secretary's house. ||46||
Then a servant of the secretary told him, "The king will be feasting in the minister's house for the wedding of Shriyaka." ||47||
"And the minister is preparing weapons to give to Nanda. For kings who love weapons, weapons are the first means of sustenance." ||48||
Vararuchi, knowing the deception, then taught the children to say, "Chana, etc., are given," and other deceptive words. ||49||
"The king does not know that this chariot driver will kill Nanda and establish Shriyaka in his kingdom." ||50||
The children were saying these deceptive words day by day, everywhere.
The king heard this from the common people and thought, ||51||
"What children say, and what women say, is the language of the people. It is not otherwise." ||52||
To confirm this, the king sent a man to the minister's house.
The man came and reported everything as he had seen. ||53||
Then, when the minister's servants came to serve him, the king, in anger, turned his face away. ||54||
Knowing his feelings, the minister said to Shriyaka, "I have been informed by someone that the king is angry with you, as if you are an enemy." ||55||
"This man is a threat to our family. Protect yourself, son! If you obey my order, ||56||
"When I bow to the king, you should cut off my head with that sword. A servant who is disloyal to his master should be killed, even if he is his father," he said. ||57||
"Even though I am old, I am eager to die for you. You will be the pillar of our family for a long time." ||58||
Shriyaka, weeping, said in a choked voice, "Father! This is a terrible deed. Even a dog would not do this." ||59||
The minister said, "By doing this, you will only fulfill the desires of your enemies." ||60||
"The king is like Yama, he will not kill me and my family. As long as I am alive, protect my family." ||61||
"I will put poison in the sacrificial cake and kill the king. You should cut off his head. You will not be guilty of patricide." ||62||
Thus instructed by his father, Shriyaka agreed and did as he was told.
The wise man, for the sake of good fortune, was doing a terrible deed. ||63||
"Son, what is this difficult deed that you have done?"
Shriyaka, trembling, said to the king, ||64||

## Chapter 250: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**66.** When a servant's fault is known, an inquiry is appropriate. When the master knows, retaliation is appropriate, not an inquiry.

**67.** After the deed, Nand, the glorious one, spoke to Sriyaka, saying, "This seal, along with all its business, should be taken."

**68.** Then, bowing down, Sriyaka informed the king, "My elder brother, named Sthulabhadra, is like a father to me."

**69.** "He has been enjoying the pleasures of the treasury, free from any obstruction by my father's grace, for twelve years now."

**70.** The king, having been informed of this matter, called Sthulabhadra and said, "I will consider this matter and act accordingly."

**71.** The king said, "I will discuss it today." Sthulabhadra, the king of the earth, went to the Asoka grove and became troubled in his mind.

**72.** Sleep, food, bathing, and other sources of happiness were not experienced even for a moment, as if by the relentless demands of his duties.

**73.** The minds of those with duties are preoccupied with the anxieties of their own country, leaving no space for their beloveds, like water in a full pot.

**74.** Even when they abandon all their own interests and work for the king's sake, slanderers trouble them like flies around a corpse.

**75.** Just as one strives to spend one's own wealth for the king's sake, why should a wise person not strive for his own sake?

**76.** Thinking thus, he tore his hair with five handfuls, and then swept away the dust with a cloth of jewels.

**77.** Then, that great soul went to the king's court and said, "This matter has been considered, and it is beneficial for dharma."

**78.** Then, from the king's court, like a lion from its cave, he emerged, devoid of essence, full of essence, burning with the fire of worldly existence.

**79.** "Why did this one, after feigning deceit, go to the prostitute's house again?" With this disbelief, the king looked out through the window.

**80.** Seeing Sthulabhadra going, with his nose unmoved even in the stench of a corpse in the area, the king shook his head.

**81.** "This one, the blessed, free from attachment, has been thinking about this fire," Nand said, praising himself aloud.

**82.** Sthulabhadra, going to the presence of Sri Sambhuti Vijaya, took initiation, accompanied by the chanting of Samayika.

**83.** Taking Sriyaka, Nand, with great respect, placed him in charge of the seal, along with all its business.

**84.** Sriyaka, always attentive to the affairs of the kingdom, became like a chariot wheel, due to his excellent skill in governance.

**85.** He always went to the treasury, courteous and respectful. Due to his brother's affection, his beloved, a noble woman, was highly respected.

**86.** Seeing Sriyaka, grieving for the separation from Sthulabhadra, she gave him a comforting look. For one who is in sorrow, seeing a loved one does not allow sorrow to remain.

**87.** Then Sriyaka said to her, "My dear, what shall we do? This Vararuchi, a wicked one, is a source of harm and destruction for us."

**88.** "He has caused the separation from S

From the separation of the beloved, from enmity, from generosity, and from the king. She immediately agreed to his request. ||91||
And by the order of the treasurer, the treasurer gave him that. As the drunkard is made by the power of women, is it not so? ||12||
Drinking wine is the taste of the king, the Bhatta has made it freely today; the treasurer praised the treasurer for the sake of the treasurer. ||93||
Then the treasurer heard everything from the mouth of the treasurer. And he thought that the enmity of his father was a punishment. ||94||
From the time of the great minister Sakatal, he also became. Bhatta Vararuchi was devoted to the service of the king. ||95||
He used to come to the royal palace every day during the time of service. And he was seen with great respect by the king and the royal people. ||96||
On another occasion, Nandaraadmantri was overwhelmed with the memory of his virtues. In the assembly, he spoke to the treasurer Sriyaka in a stammering voice. ||97||
Sakatal, the great mind, was always devoted and attached. He was my great minister, like Brihaspati to Indra. ||98||
Thus, I am unfortunate, what am I doing today by fate? I think my place is empty without him. ||99||
Sriyaka also said, "What are we doing here, my lord? This Vararuchi, the drunkard, has committed all this sin. ||100||
It is true that Bhatta drinks wine, as the king has said. I will show him tomorrow," said Sriyaka. ||101||
On the second day, Sriyaka, in the presence of all the people, gave a lotus flower to each of them, which had been taught by his own son. ||102||
At that time, he gave a lotus flower to the wicked Vararuchi, which was filled with the juice of the fruit of Madan. ||103||
"How wonderful and delightful this is," said the king and others, and they put their own lotus flowers to their noses. ||104||
Bhatta also brought his own lotus flower to his nose to smell. He immediately vomited the wine he had drunk the night before. ||105||
"Shame on this wicked man, the brother of Brahma, who is worthy of death," said everyone, and he left the assembly. ||106||
Brahmanas were requested by him to perform atonement. They said that drinking wine is a sin that can be atoned for by fire. ||107||
Vararuchi then drank the fire-heated water with a mouse. He immediately gave up his life, as if from the fear of the fire. ||108||
47. The story of the treasurer and the charioteer, as mentioned in the Sriparishishtaparva, is about self-praise. The treasurer, who was given by the king, was once pleased with the charioteer. She praised him, saying, "He is the king's property," without any attachment. ||1||
"There is no one else like Sthulabhadra, even the king," she said to the charioteer every day. ||2||
The charioteer went to the garden of his house and sat on a couch. He showed his own knowledge to entertain her. ||3||
He shot a Makandalumbi with an arrow, and then another with another arrow, and so on, until he became a master of arrows. ||4||
He cut the stem of the Makandalumbi with

## Chapter 252: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager

Now, she said, "Let me see your knowledge." And she performed a feat with mustard seeds. She scattered a heap of them and danced on top of it. (6) Then she threw a needle into the heap, covering it with flower petals. She danced, but the needle did not pierce the heap, nor was it injured. (7) Then he said, pleased, "You have done a difficult thing. Ask for anything within my power, and I will surely give it to you." (8) She said, "What difficult thing have I done that has pleased you? Is this not easier than what the great ascetic, Sthulabhadra, did?" (9) "Is cutting the Amralumbi tree and dancing like this difficult? What the uneducated Sthulabhadra did is difficult." (10) "He did not eat for twelve years, nor did he enjoy any pleasures. He stayed in the picture gallery, his vows unbroken." (11) "Milk, from the movement of the mongoose, and women, from their movement, corrupt the minds of yogis, except for the great ascetic Sthulabhadra." (12) "Who can stay even a day in the presence of women? Sthulabhadra, with his vow of unbroken rice, stayed for four months." (13) "Food with six flavors, living in the picture gallery, and being near women, even one of these would break the vow of even a man made of iron." (14) "Metal objects melt in the presence of fire, like a woman melts in the presence of a man. But I believe Sthulabhadra, the great ascetic, is made of diamond." (15) "Sthulabhadra, the great being, who has done difficult things, is difficult to describe. Even with the right words, it is difficult to describe him in words." (16) The charioteer asked, "Who is this Sthulabhadra, the great being, whom you are describing?" (17) She said, "He is the son of Nandabhupala, the minister of the king of Sakatal, whom I am describing to you." (18) Hearing this, the charioteer was overwhelmed and said, bowing his head, "I am his servant, the great ascetic Sthulabhadra." (19) Knowing that he was truly devoted, she gave him religious instruction. He awoke from his delusion and sleep. (20) Seeing that he was awakened, she revealed her own connection to him. Hearing this, his eyes filled with wonder, and he said, (21) "I have been enlightened by you, O blessed one, by your words about Sthulabhadra. You have shown me the path I must follow. (22) May you be well, O blessed one! Maintain your connection to me." Saying this, he went to the side of the great teacher and received initiation. (23) The great Sthulabhadra also kept his vow strictly. At that time, there was a famine that lasted twelve years. (24)

I go to the lake, where are the lotus flowers, the white ones?
He is patient, he is virtuous, he endures month after month. (1)
In food, in fasting, the beggar's food, with the small one.
Going, he speaks, he is angry, he kills the frog. (2)
Then the frog said, "O great sage!

**A Discourse on the Rejection of the Eager**

This thought occurred to him: "Just as a snake is killed by a Garuda, so too are all men bitten by the serpent of desire, and they are destined to be reborn in the lower realms." ||24||

In the meantime, a man named Nagadeva, a wise man, approached the sage. "O great man!" he said, "My son has become a serpent-charmer." ||25||

"He has died and been reborn as a serpent-charmer due to his past deeds," said the sage. "His name is Nagadatta, and he is endowed with good qualities." ||26||

"He is now living a life of austerity, and he has renounced his past life. He is handsome and has a beautiful voice." ||27||

"He does not indulge in worldly desires, but instead, he considers Dharma to be his only wealth. He is generous and kind, and he has renounced all other possessions." ||28||

"He has renounced his family and friends, and he has become a wandering ascetic. He has attained great wealth and prosperity through his austerities." ||29||

"He lives a pure and simple life, and he eats only the food that is offered to him. He eats only twice or thrice a day, and he eats only pure food." ||30||

"He lives in a forest, and he is a great ascetic. He lives for four months, then for two months, then for one month, and then he lives only on the food that he finds." ||31||

"He sees the suffering of the world, and he pities those who are bound by their karma. He sees the suffering of those who are caught in the cycle of birth and death." ||32||

"I, on the other hand, am weak and frail. I have been afflicted by many hardships. I eat only the food that is offered to me, and I live a life of poverty." ||33||

"If you are truly pure, then you should not live in this world, where you are constantly surrounded by the dirt and filth of karma. You should renounce your family and friends, and you should become a wandering ascetic." ||34||

"Where did you go, and how did you become so wise?" asked the man, his mind filled with wonder. "I am filled with awe at your wisdom. I am filled with wonder at your knowledge." ||35||

"The Garuda, the king of birds, has a strict rule: he will only eat those who have been given to him by the gods. He will never eat those who have not been given to him by the gods." ||36||

"The Garuda is a friend to all gods, and he is always obedient to them. He is a great ascetic, and he is always devoted to his dharma." ||37||

"The Garuda lives in the forest, and he is always surrounded by the gods. He is a great ascetic, and he is always devoted to his dharma." ||38||

"You have worshipped the gods of the three times, and you have renounced the world. You have become a great ascetic, and you have renounced the world. You have become a great ascetic, and you have renounced the world." ||39||

"I worship the Garuda of the mind, not the Garuda of the body. I know that you are the same as me. You are the same as me. You are the same as me." ||40||

"The Garuda of the body is a beggar, and he is always in need. He is always in need, and he is always in need." ||41||

"The mosquito says, 'I eat for the three times.'

The penance that the Jinas have spoken of, that is not found in you.
Then why are you inferior to me, while you are equal to me? ||44||
Just like this, the small ones praise themselves with the gods.
The great ones, with their virtues, have gone to the light, and the sinful ones are in darkness. ||45||
Having taken food, the small one invites the great ones.
He accepts the four-month vow, and he is also a hypocrite. ||46||
He spits at the rest, and he invites them to stay there.
The small one is full of pride, and he speaks with a bad heart. ||47||
He does not play with the great ones, and he says to himself, "I am not worthy." ||48||
He is condemned, and he goes to eat food.
He thinks to himself, "I am approved by the four great ones." ||49||
I am greedy for food, and I am a beast all the time.
These great ones are like lions, and they are hungry. ||50||
I am a beggar, and I am equal to you.
I have a bad heart, and I am not worthy. ||51||
He went to the place of the great ones, and he thought to himself, "Just like the earth, which is full of life, the perfect knowledge has arisen." ||52||
The wind of the gods, which is full of fragrance, blows the flowers.
The fragrance is placed in the lotus flower by the gods. ||53||
Just like this, the gods praise the great ones with their great glory.
The omniscient one speaks the Dharma, and he says to the gods, "You are great ones." ||54||
"O great ones, you will all be liberated in the three times.
You are condemned, and you are equal to the small ones, and you are advising them." ||55||
Just like this, they attain the supreme knowledge, which is pure.
The five perfect ones, with their knowledge, are liberated. ||56||
Just like this, you have suffered, and you have been forgiven.
You have been praised by the gods, so forgive them, and destroy your anger. ||57||
49. In the Srimad Bhava Vijay, which is written by Sri Uttara Adhyayana, the story of Gosthamahila is told. "And then, the story of the seventh one, who was born in the year 700, is told. ||1||" "Thus," the gods praised the Aryaraksita, who were mentioned before. They went to the city of Dashpur, along with their disciples. ||2||
They had three disciples, who were very wise. The first one was called Durbalika Pushpamitra. ||3||
The second one was the brother of the Suri, and his name was Falguraksita. The third one was Gosthamahila, who was the uncle of the Suri. ||4||
At that time, a non-believer came to the city of Mathura. He deceived many people by saying that there is no soul. ||5||
There was a group of saints, but there was no one who could argue with him. The non-believer was a deceiver, and he had to be stopped. ||6||
The group of saints in Mathura wanted to defeat the non-believer. They sent the monks to the presence of Sri Aryaraksita. ||7||

## The Scattering of Eager Refutation

They, having thus spoken, went to the glorious Aryarakshita Lokas. In Mathurapuri, the atheist loudly proclaimed, "I will conquer them all!" ||8||

To defeat him, the venerable ones should purify the city themselves. Or, they should send someone who is learned and skilled in debate. ||9||

Then, those suns, unable to go due to their age, sent the learned Goṣṭhamāhila to the assembly. ||10||

He arrived there, invited by the virtuous ones. He refuted the arguments in the debate, and the sharp-minded Cārvāka was defeated. ||11||

The conqueror of Kāśī, the disciple of the Sūri, was also a vow-bound ascetic. He stayed there for four months due to the pressure of the assembly. ||12||

The glorious Aryarakshita Sūris, knowing that their lifespan was nearing its end, thought thus. ||13||

The position of Ganadharita should be given only to a worthy recipient. Giving it to an unworthy person would be a great fault of the giver. ||14||

As they say, "The sound of the Ganadharita is like a drum. The wise person should give it to the worthy. He who gives it to the unworthy, knowing this, is a great sinner!" ||15||

Therefore, the position of Ācārya should be given only to a worthy and discerning person. An unworthy person is not worthy of it, just like a crow is not worthy of milk. ||16||

Among my disciples, there is a great person named Durbalikāpuspamitra, who is an ocean of virtues. ||17||

He is considered to be the best among all my disciples and brothers. Śrīphalgurakṣita, Goṣṭhamāhila, or both, are also considered to be worthy. ||18||

They desire the position of Ganadharita because of their kinship. They do not fully understand the subtle differences between the three. ||19||

Therefore, I will declare this difference to all the sages. I will establish my disciple, Durbalikāpuspamitra, in my position. ||20||

After considering all the virtuous ones, the Muniśvara called them together and gave the example of a gourd, oil pot, and ghee pot. ||21||

Just as from a gourd that has been turned upside down by the low, all the seeds inside quickly come out, ||22||

So, from the great mind of Durbalikāpuspamitra, who is like a gourd, the knowledge of the scriptures will flow out. ||23||

Just as oil quickly flows out of an oil pot that has been turned upside down, but some remains clinging to the pot, ||24||

So, in the case of Śrīphalgurakṣita, who is like an oil pot, the knowledge of the scriptures will flow out, but some will remain. ||25||

Just as a small amount of ghee flows out of a ghee pot that has been turned upside down, but most of it remains in the pot, ||26||

So, in the case of Goṣṭhamāhila, who is like a ghee pot, the knowledge of the scriptures will flow out, but most of it will remain. ||27||

Therefore, this ocean of virtues, who has crossed the ocean of scriptures, let Durbalikāpuspamitra be the Ganadhipati. ||28||

For now, my command should be respected by you. From now on, the words of this Ganadhipati should be respected. ||29||

Even if I do not

O friend! This monk, due to his qualities, is being established by me in your care. Therefore, he should be protected by you, like me, O great sage! ||32||

Just as I established the Goṣṭhamāhila in the care of Śrīphalgurakṣita, so too, you should act in the same way, especially. ||33||

Having said this and established him, those Śrīāryarakṣitas, who had been instructed in the right way of eating, went to heaven. ||34||

Having heard about the Śrīāryarakṣita teachers who had gone to heaven, Goṣṭhamāhila also went quickly to Daśapura. ||35||

He asked all the monks, "Who is this disciple, who has been placed in your care by the Sūris?" ||36||

Then, getting up, they pointed out the Kumbhadṛṣṭānta to him and said, "He is Śrīmadurbalikāpuṣpmitrā, a Sūri." ||37||

Hearing this, Goṣṭhamāhila, who had been praised by all the virtuous ones, was told, "Stay here," but he unwillingly went outside. ||38||

Standing separately near the previous shelter, he began to teach the ignorant, with the intention of converting them. ||39||

He wished to convert them, but he did not want to convert anyone else. Then, he searched for a flaw in the Sūris every day. ||40||

And those Sūris, named Puṣpmitrā, also spoke about the strength of the meaning, the essence of the scriptures, to all the sages. ||41||

The great sages said, "Listen to the meaning in the presence of the Sūris." Then, Goṣṭhamāhila, who had been praised, spoke. ||42||

O great intellect! You are the ones who have heard the scriptures, so accept all of them. ||43||

Previously, the Sūris taught the eighth doctrine, called Karmapravāda, to the infertile and other virtuous ones. ||44||

At that time, the infertile one, thinking about the infertile one, contemplated the threefold nature of karma-bondage. That is as follows: ||45||

Karma is bound by living beings, bound, touched, and removed. Bound karma is like a needle, wrapped in thread. ||46||

Touched karma is like needles, which are attached to a piece of cloth. Removed karma is like needles, which have become one with the hot iron. ||47||

In the past, the soul, due to the influence of attachment, aversion, and delusion, was bound by karma, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, in all its aspects. ||48||

It does the same thing, touching karma, due to the increase of its influence. Due to the influence of the contaminated, it does removed karma. ||49||

Bound karma is destroyed by means such as condemnation, etc. Touched karma is removed by means of atonement. ||50||

Removed karma, which is strongly bound by living beings, is known only at the time of its arising, and not otherwise. ||51||

Seeing him, Goṣṭhamāhila said, "This is not the way. We have not heard this from our teachers." ||52||

If karma were bound, touched, and removed by the soul, then how could there be liberation for it, due to its separate nature? ||53||

Then, Goṣṭhamāhila, who was skilled in reasoning, said, "How then did the

## The Refutation of Eager Rejection

"Even though karma is touched and bound by the soul, it is not bound again. Whoever thinks it is bound, will not have the destruction of birth. || 56 ||

This much was only told to us by the gurus during the time of teaching. This Suri does not know anything about this truth. || 57 ||

Having become doubtful, he then went to the presence of the Suri Indra. He presented the words of Mahila and asked, "Is this true?" || 58 ||

The Suris said, "What was said before is indeed true. But the words of Mahila are not appropriate due to their contradiction with logic." || 59 ||

The soul, being encompassed by its own perception, is situated in the sky. It takes on the particle of karma, never going to another place. || 60 ||

Thus, there is unity between the soul and karma, like a piece of fire. It is not just a matter of being touched, like the relationship between the body and the garment. || 61 ||

If one were to take karma from a place outside the self, then the analogy of the garment would be appropriate. || 62 ||

But this would be a wrong principle, because it would contradict the sutra. The sutra prohibits taking karma from a place outside the self. || 63 ||

Moreover, if karma, like a garment, were to be situated outside the self, then how could the pain be internal, caused by karma? || 64 ||

If it were to be due to its mobile nature, then karma would be situated in the middle. And if it is said that the pain would then be internal, then it is believed that... || 65 ||

Then the analogy of the garment for karma is completely refuted. The garment is touched externally, it is not internal. || 66 ||

Then there would be simultaneous pain both outside and inside. The pain is caused by the connection of karma both outside and inside. || 67 ||

Due to its mobile nature, that karma does not go to another place. It stays with the soul, in the body, like the breath and other winds. || 68 ||

It is believed that karma is bound by all the regions of the soul. Due to the good qualities in the whole self, the causes of attachment, etc., are bound. || 69 ||

There is no difference between the soul and karma due to their inseparable connection. It should be known that they are not separate, because you have heard this from the scriptures. || 70 ||

Because even though a stone and gold are inseparably connected, their separate nature is observed through direct perception. || 71 ||

Thus, by the words of the Suri, Vandy attained freedom from doubt. He quickly went to Mahila and told him what had been said. || 72 ||

However, that deceitful one did not accept the truth. He was thinking, "I will cause trouble elsewhere." || 73 ||

On another occasion, while reading the ninth chapter, "Refutation of Rejection," Vandy, the virtuous one, described the rejection of the Muni in this way: || 74 ||

"For as long as I live, I will reject all killing of living beings. I will reject the three types of killing in three ways, becoming a vow-taker." || 75 ||

Hearing this, Mahila said to the assembly, "The rejection of the virtuous one is not appropriate with a definite quantity." || 76 ||

When it is said, "For as long as I live," a time limit is set. Thus, there would be a fault in the hope of killing in the future. || 77 ||

Therefore, I will

Even though the rejection of food is denied by the term "masculinity" etc., it is certain. Because the time measure like "yāma" etc. is derived from it. ||81|| If it is said that the word is not there even in that case, then there would be the calamity of non-eating, because it is only for renunciation etc.! ||82|| And it is not that the rejection of food would be for the good, because then there would be the fault of contradicting the established doctrine. ||83|| Because in the doctrine, the Jinas have stated the rejection of food by the ascetics as obligatory, like ten days, future etc. ||84|| The second view, which is according to desire, is not justifiable anywhere. Because there is no service to the worthy in the absence of the muni. ||85|| And also, the fact that the rejection is immeasurable, which you have stated, is not justifiable due to contradiction of logic. ||86|| Because in the case of rejection of the impermanent, which is being done, all future food becomes the object of rejection. ||87|| And then, due to the decay of life, the ascetic who has gone to the divine state, would definitely have a breach of vows in the service of the worthy! ||88|| If it is said that the rejection is done as long as one has the strength, then it is immeasurable. ||89|| Then the rejection limited to strength is accepted by you. And thus, the acceptance of its immeasurability is not proper. ||90|| And also, it is not read as "as long as life" due to the fear of the calamity of breach of vows, but it is read as "as long as life" due to the fear of the calamity of breach of vows. ||91|| Because of the absence of fear, that rejection is also not a fault, as is evident from the renunciation of the body. ||92|| When he did not accept the statement of the worthy, then all the munis said that in this way. ||93|| This statement of the worthy is to be considered as a statement of the worthy. This is how it was said by the venerable Aryarakshita Suri. ||94|| Other elders, who are well-versed in other sects, were also asked, and they also said that the rejection is definitely limited. ||95|| Even so, Mahila did not give up that attachment. Because attachment is usually difficult to overcome for the Angas, like a wasting disease. ||96|| You should know that this truth has been stated by the Tirthankaras, as I have said. ||97|| Then the entire assembly of the worthy, including the Sadhus, asked the Jinesvara, intending to renounce the body, as instructed by the Shastra Suri. ||98||
The Suri also came and said, "What should I do?"
The assembly said, "Ask the lord of the boundary." ||99||
"Is it Mahila Muni who is speaking the truth, or the entire assembly, including the weak, the flower-friends, etc.?" ||100||
Then the goddess said, "My strength is to renounce the body, so that I may be able to go on the path, like many celestial beings." ||101||
Then, after the renunciation of the body by the assembly, the Shastra Devata went to Videha and asked the lord of the world according to the logic of the assembly. ||102||
Then Shambhu and Sakra said, "That assembly is speaking the truth. Mahila is speaking falsehood. He is the seventh slanderer." ||103||
Then the goddess who had come there

## The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager
The assembly is truthful, the Mahila is a liar, a speaker of falsehood. When they said, "Go," the Mahila said, "The assembly is too eager!" ||5||
This one is a fool, with a small intellect, how could he go there?
This is a fabricated story, not spoken by the Jina! ||6||
Then those glorious ones, named Pushpamitra, also said this:
"Believe correctly, otherwise you will be outside the assembly!" ||7||
Even so, he rejected that opinion, the assembly made him completely outside the assembly.
Taking many people with him, the one who had lost his knowledge-jewel wandered on the earth! ||108||
## 50. The Example of Charudatta, as Told in the *Upadeśa Prāsāda* on the Meditation of Non-Attachment
In Champā, there lived a wealthy merchant named Bhānuśreṣṭhi, his son was Charudatta, he was married to a suitable girl in his youth, gradually he became detached from worldly affairs and did not desire a wife, later Charudatta was freed to learn cunning in a brothel, gradually he became attached to it and even abandoned his home, after twelve years, his father, at the end of his life, told his son, "You have never done what I have told you, therefore do this from now on, in times of difficulty, this salutation should be remembered, then after the death of your parents, you will be freed from all possessions, your wife has gone to her father's house, then taking your father-in-law's wealth, you boarded a chariot and went to Śrī. The chariot broke. Reaching a safe place, you got off and went to your maternal uncle's house. Taking wealth from him, while going on the road, your wealth was stolen by a robber. Then, wandering on the earth, he met a yogi. He divided the wealth into two parts, and was placed on a platform and released into a well of juice. With that juice, a pot was filled, that pot was taken by the yogi, pulling the platform. Then the platform was thrown into the middle, taking that juice-pot, the yogi disappeared, there he gave a salutation to a dying man. There, for three days, he suffered hunger, with the help of a cow's tail, and then he left. While going ahead, he met his maternal uncle's son, Rudradatta, he said, "Two rams are being taken, and they are going to the Golden Island." Then he took the two rams. Then they went to the seashore. Rudradatta said, "Kill these two, and enter the furnace with the razor blades that we have taken. Then they will take out the flesh from the furnace and take it to the Golden Island. There, you will get gold." Charudatta said, "How can killing living beings be done?" Rudradatta quickly killed his own ram, while he was killing the second one, Charudatta made the ram hear the salutation, and the ram refused to eat. Then both of them entered the furnace. They were taken out of the furnace by the furnace-workers. On the way, Charudatta's furnace fell into a lake from the mouth of a bird. Then he came out, wandering from place to place, he saw a Vidya-cara-ṛṣi and stood bowing to him. The muni said, "From where have you come to this place, which is inaccessible to humans?" When he told him his suffering, the muni described the sixth vow. He accepted it. From there, a god came and bowed to Charudatta and praised him. Then, the

Its origin has been mentioned during the discussion of the second vow. Having left the dog existence, he was born as a goat in the fifth existence. He was offered in sacrifices. In the sixth existence, he was taken by Charudatta for non-violence and was taught the salutation. Due to that merit, he died and went to heaven. I am that god. I have come here to preach the Dharma words given by my Guru through knowledge. Therefore, he was first saluted and then praised.” Hearing this, Charudatta also took initiation due to dispassion. He attained heaven through penance. 51. In the Sri Aakhyanaka Manikosh, the story of Subhadra is related to the slander of others.
She was like the jewel of the Anga-Jana clan. In the city of Champa, she was like a beautiful palace. ||1|| There lived a wealthy merchant named Jinadatta, who was the king of eyes, a true devotee of the Jain teachings. ||2||
He had a beautiful daughter, the jewel of daughters, the delight of the family. Her lotus-like feet were adorned with lotus-like ornaments. ||3||
She was named Subhadra, a true follower of the Jain teachings, a dwelling of the virtues of the monks, like a swan devoted to the service of the lotus of the Jain path. ||4||
She was happily engaged in her household duties. She was seen by the wise servant of the wealthy merchant, Buddhadasa. ||5||
Seeing her, he thought in his mind, “Oh, her beauty captivates even the inhabitants of the world. ||6||
Who is this woman? Is she a wife? Or is she a great lady? Or is she a celestial being?” ||7||
Thinking thus, he was pierced by the arrow of love in his heart. To fulfill his desire, he sent a messenger to her house. ||8||
Jinadatta, hearing this, asked the messenger about the matter. The messenger told him everything. The merchant said, ||9||
“In her family, beauty, youth, and charm are all present. She is not interested in worldly matters. ||10||
If there is any conflict, it will be due to her devotion to the true Dharma. Therefore, I will not give her to you. Go back to Buddhadasa.” ||11||
Hearing this, the messenger went back home. He thought in his heart, “I will learn the art of deception and win her over.” ||12||
He went to the sage and bowed down to him. He said, “Oh, venerable one, please teach me the true Dharma, the Dharma that is the fear of the cycle of birth and death.” ||13||
The sage, being compassionate, taught him the Dharma as preached by the Jinas. He, being afraid of the cycle of birth and death, accepted it like a thirsty man accepts water. ||14||
Day after day, he listened to the teachings of the Jinas and his mind became filled with devotion. The teachings of the Jinas became firmly established in his mind. ||15||
He bowed down to the monk and said, “Oh, venerable one, please listen to my words. I have accepted the Jain Dharma and I will not engage in any worldly affairs.” ||16||

## Chapter 262: The Scattering of the Rejection of the Eager One

This Dharma, indeed, has matured in the midst of pure conduct. The nature, born from the previous births, is like a shield. ||17||

Oh, how fearful! Tell me, O Muni, everything. He has been well-instructed in all twelve types of virtuous Dharma. ||18||

He is devoted to the Jina's teachings, with a distinguished appearance, deeply attached. He is adorned with Jina-purification, Guru-worship, understanding, and meditation. ||19||

Possessing such virtuous qualities, he was given by Jina-datta, as his own, to Buddha-dasa. ||20||

He, the great, the powerful, was given in marriage by the low-born one. He enjoys worldly pleasures, bound to her. ||21||

Thus, Jina-datta, the husband, said, "I have given her to you." He has given her to you, like a slave, in the house of the law. ||22||

Jina-datta, seeing her there, in this bed, said, "I will bring disgrace upon the Dharma, by this transgression." ||23||

Buddha-dasa said, "I will make a separate house for her." Jina-datta, pleased and honored, agreed. ||24||

He, with his new-born attachment, took her to the house of the law. Buddha-dasa was given a separate dwelling. ||25||

In the house of Subhaddā, the Muni's food and drink are always available. They enter, they carry, and they offer the best of offerings. ||26||

Buddha-dasa's wife, meeting with these, is filled with envy. Because of her greed, she remains wicked, even with the Jinas. ||27||

Hearing this, she spoke harsh and bitter words, filled with anger. "Such a thing is not possible, it is not proper." ||28||

The sun does not abandon its course, even when the clouds gather. Similarly, Subhaddā's virtue does not break, no matter what. ||29||

A lotus does not wither, even when it grows in a swamp. Similarly, Subhaddā's virtue does not break, no matter what. ||30||

A barren woman does not give birth to a son, even with the help of a magician. Similarly, Subhaddā's virtue does not break, no matter what. ||31||

A thief does not reach the underworld, even if he steals the wealth of the gods. Similarly, Subhaddā's virtue does not break, no matter what. ||32||

These are the words of separation, spoken by those who are wicked and depraved. Thus, she entered the house of Subhaddā. ||33||

She, with her body free from karma, is difficult to understand, and impossible to defeat. Her eyes, filled with envy, looked upon her. ||34||

Think like this, a Muni, a great being, is free from attachment. Do not destroy this eye, this particle. ||35||
Thinking this, Subhaddā quickly, with ease, with goodness,
On the second and third day, collected a particle with her tongue. ||36||
Then, Subhaddā's forehead, adorned with red sandalwood, was marked with a sesame seed.
It was placed in the middle of the goodness-filled circle, not even two. ||37||
On the forehead of the good Subhaddā, the sesame seed was obtained through deceit and trickery.
It was obtained by the three, Nandā, Sāsuyā, and Bhāujjājā. ||38||
Akkanti, the servant of Buddha, desired the good conduct of the wife.
In the middle of the servant's circle, he desired the reflection of the sesame seed. ||39||
As long as Buddha, the servant, desired it, it remained there, visible.
The five senses were quickly detached from it, in the middle of the world. ||40||
Thinking this, Subhaddā thought, "What kind of stain is born?
A stain is born in the middle of the great power of the Muni. ||41||
For those who are bound by the great delusion of the world, by the attachment to household life,
Stains are born, for those who are living, what is this worth? ||42||
For those who are deluded by the world, by the attachment to the world, by the great delusion, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the world, by the attachment to the

The eager rejection spreader.
The four doors of the city are closed, the white ones are locked. No one else is able to open them. ||54||
I will tell you where the great sage is in the assembly of the Jains. She will open them with the water of the churning stick. ||55||
She will open them, and then she will jump, and then she will be there. Like a jewel, she will be there, and she will be there. ||56||
After that, Subhadra will cross the barrier and stand there. She will leave the city at the time of the great light. ||57||
She will open them until they are all open, and no one will be able to close them.
Even if they are broken, they will not break, nor will the world. ||58||
Then, suddenly, the people of the city will be filled with joy. They will all go in four directions at the same time. ||59||
Seeing this, the people will be amazed. They will think, "Is this a divine miracle, or is it something else?" ||60||
Then, the king, the protector of the people, will be very happy. He will be surrounded by the people, with a stick in his hand. ||61||
He will bow down to the beautiful mountains, with humility and respect. He will ask, "Who is this great sage?" ||62||
"Whether it is a god, a demon, a human, or a Kinnara, whoever it is, I have blocked the way. Please forgive me." ||63||
Then, standing in the assembly, the immortal one will say, "Listen! Whoever in this city is the great sage, ||64||
she will be bathed three times with the water of the churning stick. She will open the doors and be free from all suffering." ||65||
Hearing this, all the people of the city, the king, the ministers, the great ones, and the many others, ||66||
the singers, the auspicious ones, the ones who carry the great sage, the ones who are bathed in the water of the churning stick, the ones who are united, ||67||
all the men and women of the city, the ones who are devoted to the king, will all be happy. Then, Subhadra will speak to them, standing in front of them. ||68||
"Please allow me, mother! I will do as I have decided."
Smiling, they will all agree. ||69||
"Know that the doors are open, and the great sage is free. You will open them, because you are the one who is respected by the monks." ||70||
"The ones who are blocking the way, they have been gathered together. The churning stick is powerful. The water that has been churned will not even drip a single drop." ||71||
"The obstacles that are in the way, all of them, Subhadra will remove them. She will move the water of the churning stick and make it flow." ||72||

The earth-goddess, with a smile, sprinkled the water of the auspicious pot. The crowd of gods, yakshas, and gandharvas, all stirred. ||73||
She bowed her head, like a lotus, to the great sage's lotus feet.
She said, "My Lord! Great Sage! I have done a great service." ||74||
She opened the gates of the city, and the auspicious one, too. The king, following the eastern gate, entered. ||75||
In the meantime, the great sage, seeing the crowd of people,
The assembly of gods, yakshas, gandharvas, and asuras, all came. ||76||
After that, the auspicious one, with three pitchers of water,
Opened the gates, and bowed down to the Jina. ||77||
She opened the gates, and the sound of the conch shell echoed. The sound of victory, the sound of the celestial drums, rose. ||78||
A shower of flowers, fragrant with the scent of the gods, fell. The auspicious one, with a smile, jumped on the head of the god. ||79||
He said, "O, protector of the world, you are blessed! You are the great sage's disciple!
By your virtue, even the gods are filled with joy." ||80||
He said, "Victory to the virtue, whose power makes the moon shine!
It rains, at the appointed time, with the water of the celestial river." ||81||
After that, the auspicious one, going around the city, from the earth to the sky,
Opened the southern and western gates. ||82||
Then, she sprinkled water on the northern gate, and said, "Open this gate, which leads to the great sage's abode." ||83||
Even today, in the city of Champanagara, that gate stands. The auspicious one, reaching the Jina's temple, stood there. ||84||
The gods, the gandharvas, praised her. The celestial women, bowing down, sang her praises. ||85||
The people, bowing down, experienced the power of the Jina's virtue. Reaching the Jina's temple, they bowed down to the Jina. ||86||
Then, going to the house of the virtuous one, she bowed down with devotion.
She moved, according to the rules, on the earth, with her eyes fixed on the ground. ||87||
She moved, with a graceful gait, in the deep, narrow lanes. She moved, with a graceful gait, in the house of the virtuous one. ||88||
He bowed down, and the king, filled with joy, went with his retinue. The auspicious one, by her virtue, was also very pleased. ||89||
This is the power of virtue, which is praised by all the worlds. By enjoying the pleasures of the senses, one is reborn in the hell. ||90||

52. In the *Anga Rishi Katha* section of the *Shree Aavashyakahari Bhadriya Vritta*, there is a story about a teacher named Champak Kosi Ajjo. He had two disciples - Angarisi Ruddo and Ango Bhaddo. Angarisi was named so because of his Anga (body) and Ruddo was named so because he was a *ganthi-chhed* (one who cuts knots). Both of them were sent by their teacher to carry wood. Angarisi was carrying a heavy load and was struggling. Ruddo, on the other hand, was enjoying himself and was looking at the scenery. He saw Angarisi struggling with the heavy load and thought, "This fellow is being exploited by the teacher." At that moment, a young boy named Joijasa, who was carrying food for his father, a *panthaga* (one who travels on foot), was passing by. Ruddo hit the boy with a stick. Angarisi, seeing this, put down his load and went to the teacher, complaining about Ruddo's behavior. He said, "Just like you hit the innocent Joijasa, who was so handsome and full of life, Ruddo has come here." The teacher, hearing this, thought, "The *suhaj-jhavasana* (one who has attained the highest state of liberation) has attained *jati* (birth), *sariya* (conduct), *sanjama* (self-control), *keval-nana* (omniscience), and *deva-mahima* (divine glory). He has been told by the gods that if he gives *abbakhana* (food) to this fellow, Ruddo will be ridiculed by people." He then thought, "It is true that I gave him *abbakhana*." With this thought, he attained *sambuddhi* (perfect knowledge), *patteya-buddhi* (understanding), and became a *brahmana* (one who has attained the highest state of knowledge). He also attained the four *pavvaya* (stages of liberation) - *uppanna-nana* (arising knowledge), *siddha* (perfected), etc. 

53. In the *Aaramdha-dhyana* section of the *Shree Aavashyakahari Bhadriya Vritta*, there is a story about *Kurudo-utkurudo*. 
The fourth *karado-kurudo* was a teacher who lived in Kunala-nayeri, at the foot of a mountain. During the rainy season, the gods showered their blessings on the city, but the people were suffering due to the heavy rains. The *karado* was angry and said, "Oh, rain god! Kunala!" The *utkurudo* said, "Ten days and five more." The *karado* said, "Stop the rain!" The *utkurudo* said, "Just like the night, so is the day." They continued to argue like this. The rain continued for fifteen days, and the city was flooded. The people were suffering. Then, the rain stopped, and the water receded. The city was destroyed. The *karado* and *utkurudo* were both blamed for the destruction. The city was destroyed in the thirteenth year after the *keval-nana* (omniscience) of Mahavira.

Your brother Jaratkumara will also meet his end. ||6|| "This is a vile wretch," thus thinking with a mind full of impurities, Jaratkumara saw all the Yadus. ||7|| Even though I am the son of Vasudeva, how can I be a fratricide? I will try to do everything else, thus thinking. ||8|| Rising up, he bowed to Nemi and became a wielder of two arrows.

Even though I am unable to release you, I have released you, O sinless one." ||16|| "You, having performed austerities and become distressed, have become a goddess, having gone through misfortune. Remember this brotherly love when you come to my aid." ||17|| Saying "Yes," Siddhartha renounced the world in the presence of his master.

## Chapter 268: The Scattering of the Eagerly Rejected

Krishna, filled with sorrow, thought, "Alas, how unfortunate is the fate of these princes, a fate that will bring ruin to their lineage!"

Then, Krishna, accompanied by Rama, went to the sage Dvaipayana. He saw him with eyes red with anger, his gaze like a venomous serpent.

He appeared like a great lion, terrifying beyond measure. Janardana tried to console the three-staffed sage.

"Anger is the greatest enemy, which brings not only sorrow but also continuous birth in the cycle of births and deaths."

"My sons, blinded by ignorance and intoxicated by drink, have committed this offense. O great sage, your anger is justified."

Even though Krishna spoke thus, the three-staffed sage did not calm down. He said to Krishna, "Your consoling words are in vain.

"The cause of my sons being struck was ordained by me. Without you, I will burn Dwarka along with all its inhabitants. There is no escape."

Rama also tried to dissuade Krishna, saying, "Do not be deceived, brother. This wandering ascetic is a deceiver, a cheat."

"Those with crooked noses, thick lips and noses, and unusual eyes, those with defective limbs, will never attain peace."

"If this is said, then the destruction of the existing object is inevitable. The words of the omniscient are true, and there is no other way."

Then, filled with sorrow, Krishna returned to his palace. The prophecy of Dvaipayana was revealed in Dwarka.

The bearer of the bow announced it in the city on the second day. The people, especially those devoted to dharma, were greatly disturbed.

All the people, including the Lord himself, gathered there. Sri Nemi, along with the sages, resided on the Raivataka mountain.

Going there and bowing down, Krishna listened to the teachings, which dispelled the great delusion and sleep of the world, like the rays of the sun.

Some of the princes, including Pradyumna, Samba, Nishadha, Ulmuka, and Saran, renounced the world after hearing those teachings of dharma.

Many Yadava women, including Rukmini and Jambavati, filled with fear of the future, renounced the world at the feet of their Lord.

The omniscient Lord, asked by Krishna, said, "Dvaipayana will burn this Dwarka in twelve years."

Krishna thought, "Those who renounced the world earlier, like the conquerors of the sea, are fortunate. They renounced the world before becoming addicted to worldly pleasures and uninitiated."

Knowing his intention, the Lord said to Krishna, "The bowmen never renounce the world, for they are bound by their karma.

"They will surely go down to the land of sand. You, however, will go to the land of light."

Hearing this, Krishna was immediately filled with despair.

The omniscient Lord said again, "Do not be disheartened, Janardana. You will be lifted from the mortal world and become a celestial being.

"After falling from the celestial world, you will be born as the king of Ganga-dwar. You will be the son of the conqueror of enemies, and your name will be Dwadasha.

"You will go to Brahmaloka, but you will fall from there. Then, you will be born as a human being in the land of Bharata.

"When the earth ascends, O Janardana, you will attain liberation in the holy place of the holy one."

Having said this, the Lord of the universe went elsewhere. Bowing down to him, Vasudeva returned to the city of Dwarka.

Krishna again caused the proclamation to be made. Especially the people who were devoted to Dharma all became so. ||56||
After death, Dvaipayana was born among the Agnikumara. He remembered the past enmity and went to Dwaraka. ||57||
The Asura Dvaipayana saw all the people there, from the fourth, sixth, eighth, etc., all devoted to the worship of the Gods. ||58||
Unable to cause any harm there due to the influence of Dharma, the intelligent Dvaipayana searched for loopholes for eleven years. ||59||
In the twelfth year, the people thought that due to the penance, Dvaipayana was destroyed, defeated, and we are happy. ||60||
Those who were addicted to drinking and eating meat, started to indulge freely. The knowledgeable Dvaipayana also got an opportunity then. ||61||
Various calamities, similar to the calamities at the end of the Kalpa, appeared in Dwaraka, which were seen by the Yamadwaras. ||62||
Meteors fell, there were earthquakes, the planets emitted smoke and comets. ||63||
The sun's disc, full of holes, caused a rain of fire. Suddenly, there was an eclipse of the sun and moon. ||64||
The children in the houses made fun and applied leprous ointment. The images of the Gods, painted on the walls, laughed. ||65||
Dogs entered the city, and the Asura Dvaipayana, surrounded by Sakinis, Vetalas, etc., wandered around. ||66||
The citizens saw in their dreams that they were smeared with red cloth, submerged in mud, and being dragged towards the south. ||67||
The jewels of Balarama and Krishna, like the Sirac Chakra, etc., were lost. Then the Asura Dvaipayana created a whirlwind. ||68||
He took away everything from the city, wood, grass, etc., from all sides. He brought the people who were dying from all directions and threw them in the city. ||69||
The city was filled with wood due to the wind from all eight directions, which uprooted the branches. ||70||
The Asura set fire to the city of Dwaraka, burning sixty crore families outside and seventy crore families inside. ||71||
The fire blazed like the fire of destruction, engulfing the whole world with smoke and darkness. ||72||
The citizens, young and old, were unable to move even a step, as if they were tied together. ||73||
Hari, along with Vasudeva, Devaki, and Rohini, was putting them in the chariot, to save them from the fire. ||74||
The horses did not move, nor did the bulls. The serpents were paralyzed by the Asura, like they were struck by a thunderbolt. ||75||
Then Balarama and Krishna themselves pulled the chariot. The yoke of the chariot broke immediately, with a loud crack like a branch. ||76||
Even then, they pulled the chariot to the gate with their strength. The people, with sorrowful minds, cried out, "Save us, O Rama, O Krishna!" ||77||
Then the Asura immediately closed the gate with its doors. Rama, with a blow of his hand, broke them into pieces like earthen pots. ||78||
The chariot, as if swallowed by the earth, did not move. The God said to Rama and Krishna, "Is this your delusion? ||79||
Oh, it was told to you earlier, that without me, no one can be liberated. My penance has been bought by me." ||80||

## The Scattering of Eager Refusal

Then their parents said, "O sons, go! All the Yadavas live because of you two. You have already accomplished what was to be done by your valor. This is a stronger and more difficult situation to be overcome."

"We, who are deprived of fortune, will not attain the fruit of our own actions by initiation at the end of Sri Nemi's feet. We will not experience it."

Even after being told this, when Rama and Krishna did not go, Vasudeva, Devaki, and Rohini spoke. "Therefore, Sri Nemi, the world teacher, is our refuge. We have renounced the four types of food. We have renounced the Arhats, the Siddhas, the Sadhus, and the Dharma as taught by the Arhats. Therefore, we, who desire refuge, have taken refuge in Him. We are not anyone's, nor is anyone ours. We have stood firm in the prescribed worship, devoted to prostration."

Then Dvapayana rained fire like a cloud of fire upon them. The three, Vasudeva and the others, were afflicted and went to heaven.

Rama and Krishna went outside the city to the old garden. There they saw the city burning. The walls of jewels had become like dust and broken stones. The pillars of sandalwood and go-shirsha had become like ashes and straw. The heads of the city walls were crumbling and falling. The foundations of the houses were bursting and cracking. There was no space between the flames, as if in the ocean. Everything became one fire, as if one ocean in destruction. The fire danced with its fiery hands and roared with its fiery sounds. It drove the people of the city like fish in a net, through the smoke.

Then Krishna said to Siri, "Alas! This is like a club now. I am standing on the shore and seeing my own city burning. Just as I cannot save the city, so I cannot bear to see it. O Arya, tell me where we should go, everything is against us."

Balabhadra, the friend, the relative, and the kinsman, spoke. "Our Pandava cousins are there, in their dwelling."

Krishna said then, "They have been made free of poison by me. How can we go to their dwelling, ashamed by our own wrongdoing?"

Rama said, "The virtuous keep kindness in their hearts. They never remember wrongdoing, as if it were a bad dream."

"They have been honored in many ways, those grateful Pandava sons. They will only offer respect. Brother, consider it otherwise."

Thus spoken to by Siri, Shārṅga turned his bow east and south. He saw the Pandava city, called Pandu-Mathura.

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Hearing this, Nanda, having learned the twelve aspects of household dharma, renounced them.  He bowed to his master and returned home.  He perfectly followed the household dharma, increasing in merit.  He considered himself to be a renunciant, freed from the cycle of birth and death.  

Even though he was in the company of the un-enlightened, day after day, he remained steadfast in his renunciation.  He was content in the company of the liberated, even in the midst of hardship.  

During the month of Jyestha, at the time of the Posha festival, Nanda, the wealthy merchant, the best of the Maniyari, was overcome by a desire to build a pond.  He was filled with the desire to create a place of peace and tranquility.  He thought, "May these good people, these living beings, live long in this world."

He thought, "I will build a pond, a place where people can come to drink cool, clear water, bathe, and play."  The wealthy merchant, Prabha, thought, "I will build a pond."  

He called upon the skilled architect, Parihiyalakkhavatti, who was skilled in building houses.  He requested him to build a pond.  

He said, "O Dev!  I want to build a pond in this area, a pond that will be a source of joy for the people.  I want to build a pond that will be a source of happiness for the people."

The architect, with his skilled hands, built a pond with a beautiful, shady canopy of trees, including the Himtala, Tala, Tali, and Tamala.  The pond was filled with clear, pure water, adorned with garlands of pearls.  It was a place of beauty and tranquility, with swans swimming gracefully on its surface.  

The pond was filled with the fragrance of lotus, kumuda, and kuvalaya flowers.  It was a place where bees buzzed happily, attracted by the sweet scent of the flowers.  The pond was surrounded by a beautiful grove of trees, with fish, frogs, and turtles swimming in its waters.  

Nanda, the wealthy merchant, built this pond, which he named "Nanda."  He also built a place where people could come to eat and drink, a place where they could find peace and happiness.  He thought, "I will build a place where people can come to find peace and happiness."

People came to the pond to bathe, drink water, and play.  They all enjoyed the pond, and they all praised Nanda for his generosity.  

Nanda, the wealthy merchant, was a good man.  He lived a long and happy life.  He built this pond, which was filled with cool, clear water.  

Hearing this, Nanda was filled with joy.  He thought, "What a wonderful thing I have done!  Who in this world would not be happy to have done such a good deed?"

However, after some time, Nanda was afflicted by a terrible illness.  He suffered from sixteen different diseases, all of which were very painful.  

Five doctors came to treat him, but they were unable to cure him.  He was very sick, and he was close to death.  He thought, "I am going to die.  I will never see my beautiful pond again."

He remembered the joy that he had brought to the people by building the pond.  He thought, "I have brought joy to the people.  I have made them happy."

He thought about his past deeds, and he was filled with remorse.  He thought, "Oh, what have I done?  I have neglected my own spiritual development.  I have wasted my life on material

The Jina, the hero, is like a lotus that blooms in the mud of the world.
The Dharma of the world teacher is also like the fragrance of that lotus. ||26||
What have I gained by being foolish and following the rules?
This is the result of my wrong actions. ||27||
Today, I will do something good, so that I can attain liberation.
This is the thought that the sixth sense organ creates. ||28||
He who is devoted to the Dharma, will be freed from the cycle of birth and death by following the right path, by eating the right food, and by being diligent. ||29||
In the right time and place, the wise man will be like a lotus blooming in a pond. ||30||
Hearing this, the king, who was filled with devotion, went to the place where the Jina was. ||31||
He went to the place where the Jina was, and he thought, "I will bow down to the Jina." ||32||
Then, the king, surrounded by his army, went to the place where the Jina was. ||33||
The king's horse stepped on the Jina's foot. ||34||
The king was filled with remorse, and he died in the palace of the Jina. ||35||
57. The story of Skandaka, from the Srimad Bhava Vijay, written by Sri Uttara Adhyayana.
In the city of Sravasti, there was a king named Jitasatru. ||1||
He had a queen named Dharini. ||1||
They had a son named Skandaka, who was like Skanda, the son of Gauri and Shiva. ||2||
He was married to Purandara Yasha, the daughter of Purandara. ||2||
At that time, there was a king named Dandaki, who ruled the city of Kumbhakara. ||3||
His minister was a wise man named Palaka. ||3||
Dandaki, the king, gave his daughter Purandara Yasha in marriage to Skandaka. ||4||
Once, Suvrata Swami, the great teacher, was staying in Sravasti. ||5||
He was worshipped by gods and demons. ||5||
Skandaka went to him to listen to his teachings. ||6||
He heard the teachings and the Dharma of Sraddha, and he accepted them. ||6||
Palaka, the minister, went to Sravasti from the city of Kumbhakara on some royal business. ||7||
He was in the king's court, and he was criticizing Skandaka. ||8||
Skandaka quickly refuted his arguments. ||8||
Palaka was angry with Skandaka. ||9||
He could not do anything to Skandaka at that time. ||9||
Palaka finished his work and returned to his own place. ||10||
But his anger towards Skandaka did not subside. ||10||
Skandaka, with a calm mind, went to Suvrata Swami. ||11||
He became a monk, along with five hundred people. ||11||
Suvrata Swami, who was a great teacher, gave Skandaka five hundred disciples. ||12||

## Chapter 274: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

Others said, "He is worthy of good conduct, Skandaka asked." "I will go to my own country, if there is an order from the Lord," he said. ||13||

The Lord of the world said, "There will be a calamity near the end." Hearing this, Skandaka said, "This is a calamity for all." ||14||

"For those who practice devotion, there is no calamity. It is a cause of sorrow for those who desire great joy!" ||15||

"Then tell me, O Lord! When that calamity arrives, will we be devotees or will we be tormentors?" ||16||

The Lord said, "Except for you, all others are devotees." Hearing this, Skandaka, eager, wiped his eyes. ||17||

"There are devotees in the monastery where the virtuous reside. Surely this is auspicious," Skandaka thought and remained steadfast. ||18||

Gradually, he went to the potter's place, with his belongings. The king heard about the sage who had settled in the garden. ||19||

Then, to prevent any impurity, the king secretly hid various weapons in the garden. ||20||

He told the queen, "Skandaka has arrived here, defeated by the Pariṣahas." ||21||

"He himself is very powerful, with fierce arms and strong blows. He is accompanied by five hundred soldiers, wearing the garb of virtuous men. ||22||

"He has hidden terrible weapons in the garden, and is going to kill you and take over the kingdom!" ||23||

"If you don't believe me, O Lord, go to the garden and see the hidden weapons!" ||24||

Thus, urged by him, the king went to the garden. He saw various weapons in the places indicated by the king's servant. ||25||

Seeing them, the king became angry and bound all the monks. "There is no wrong for those who act without thinking." ||26||

"It is the fault of the king's servant. Binding them, the king handed them over, saying, "Do whatever you wish with them!" ||27||

Like a cat finding mice, he was delighted. He brought the bound monks to the torture device. ||28||

"Remember your beloved deity! Now I will torture you all with this device." ||29||

Then, those virtuous, fearless monks, knowing that death was near, their minds free from the desire for life and fear of death, ||30||

looked at each other properly, and adopted a friendly attitude. They all performed their final devotions according to the rules. ||31||

"Even the fearful and the brave must die. Both must face death with courage." ||32||

Thus, encouraged by Skandaka, they became especially fearless, even in the face of death. ||33||

The cruel-minded, cruel-acting, cruel-speaking king then threw each monk into the device, torturing them one by one. ||34||

Seeing his own people being tortured, Skandaka felt a burning pain within. He was bound near the device. ||35||

Even though he was surrounded by the blood of the monks, Skandaka did not waver. ||36||

But the great sage, with words that were soothing and timely, dispelled their doubts. He said: "The soul is different from the body, and the body is merely a vessel for the soul. Why should anyone grieve for the body, knowing that it is merely a temporary dwelling place?  

"All suffering is the result of one's own karma. It is not a punishment from God, but the natural consequence of one's actions. 

"There is no need to be angry at the destruction of this external body, for it is impermanent. What matters is the protection of the inner, eternal soul, the true treasure. 

"The pure-minded, having been freed from their doubts by the teachings of Skandaka, remained steadfast in their faith, with equanimity towards both friend and foe. 

"They endured the suffering inflicted by the machine, for they were rich in forgiveness. They ultimately attained the bliss of liberation, one by one. 

"In the same way, when the five hundred sages were killed, Skandaka, the protector, gave his life for a single, insignificant child. 

"Seeing the child being tortured, he said, 'I cannot bear to see this innocent child suffer. Please torture me instead!' 

"Hearing this, the tormentor, filled with a desire to inflict great pain, immediately tortured the child in the presence of the guru. 

"The child, though young, was a great soul, with a heart filled with the essence of pure meditation and the fire of selfless action. He attained great bliss. 

"Seeing this, Skandaka, the teacher, was filled with anger and disappeared. He said, 'I have been destroyed by this evil! 

"Even a small child, who was not protected for a single moment by my words, is now lost. This evil must be punished, for it has challenged my pride. 

"This king must also be punished, for he is responsible for my destruction. Those who ignore us must be killed, even the common people. 

"If this difficult task is accomplished, it will be the fruit of my penance. I will become the destroyer of these evil ones in my next life. 

"Thus, the sage, having made his resolve, was tortured by the wicked king. He died, and was reborn as a celestial being in the realm of the fire-gods. 

"Indra, the king of the gods, pondered, 'Why are there no righteous people to be seen in the city today?' 

"He then took the best dust-remover from Skandaka, the sage, and gave it to a vulture. 

"By the force of destiny, the dust-remover fell in front of Indra's wife, who was walking. 

"Picking it up, she examined it and recognized it as a piece of the robe of her brother, who had renounced the world. 

"Recognizing the mark, she knew that her brother and the other sages had been killed. Filled with great grief, she went to the king and said, 

"You wicked, evil man! You will be punished for your crimes. To disrespect the great sages and the gods is never auspicious. 

"I have decided to renounce the world. I am done with this life of suffering. 

"Thinking this, she was taken by the gods to the presence of Suvrata, the master of vows. She renounced the world and attained liberation in the other world. 

"Skandaka, the sage, having learned of his past deeds, was filled with anger. He looked upon the city with a vengeful eye. 

"He then went to the forest, the land of the king of Dandaka. This place is still known as Dand

## Chapter 276: The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

**58. In the *Sri Akhyanaka Manikose*, a story about Vishnu, the cause of the arising of karma is explained.**

1. Kanha was captured by the ropes of time, bound by the knot of the Kali Yuga. The aged prince, Jara Kumar, was present there.
2. Kanha, with the mind of a deer, was pierced by a sharp arrow in his left foot.
3. Filled with fear, he stood up and said, "Oh, oh! By what arrow have I been pierced in my foot?"
4. "Oh, oh! This is the deed of my enemy, the one who has no lineage, no name, no family, no karma. I have not done anything to him, yet he has attacked me."
5. "Alas, alas! This must be some human being, a servant of mine. This is not a deer hunter, for he has wounded me so badly."
6. "Tell me your lineage," he asked, and the hunter replied, "Oh, oh! I am born of the Hari Vamsa, a descendant of the Yadu clan."
7. "My name is Jara Kumar, a descendant of the great warrior, the one who destroyed the Yadu clan, the son of Vasudeva, the one who shines like the sun."
8. "I live in the forest of Ruru, Hari, Simha, and Sadula, a fierce forest, for the protection of the living beings. I am a hunter."
9. "This is Kanha, the aged prince," he said, revealing his identity.
10. "Come, come, come out! You are a hunter, a killer! Attack! This is Kanha, your enemy, even though he is your king."
11. "I am not a hunter, nor am I a killer. I am a follower of the path of righteousness. I am not a person of bad character."
12. "I am afraid of Kanha, the friend of the living beings, the one who has lived for twelve years. I am afraid of him because of his great power."
13. "What is the use of hiding? I am caught in the middle of a great army. Even if he is merciful, I am afraid of being captured."
14. "What is the use of doing such deeds? I am not a killer. I am not a person of bad character. Now I am thinking, where should I go to hide?"

Thus, having been pierced, he was greatly choked and was about to die. He was about to cry out in great pain. ||15|| Oh Kanha! Oh Janarddana! Oh ornament of the lineage of the Jinas! Oh! How have these illusions bound you, devoid of your friends and relatives? ||16|| Should I enter the fire? Or should I enter the cave of the Guhila? Where should I go for refuge? Whose face should I see? ||17|| In the midst of the world, the fame of the weak is like the fame of Kanha, who was killed by Jarakumaara. ||18|| Thus, when Jarakumaara asked, the entire story of the arrival was told to him by Kanha. ||19|| This is the story of the destruction of the lineage of the Jinas, which is like a river of false words. Janarddana told this story to the assembly. ||20|| Oh, you who have the gem of compassion in your heart, who have rescued the arrow from your feet, go to the Pandu-Mahura with the help of the after-effects of the arrow. ||21|| If you are indeed so strong, then you too will kill me. Do not let the lineage of the Jinas be destroyed, let it not be without a successor. ||22|| The story of the past, the destruction of the lineage of the Jinas, is told in the twelfth chapter. Even in my case, death should be told to the sons of Pandu. ||23|| Thus, Kanha, weeping profusely, was overcome with grief. ||24|| Kanha, who was suffering from the pain of the arrow, was overwhelmed with grief and sorrow. He thought thus, with a heart full of hatred. ||25|| Oh, I wish I had a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that of the Sun, a lineage like that of the Hari-Vamsa, a lineage like that

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

I condemn all four paths, I despise the bad, I hate the wicked. I approve of all that is good, I see it clearly. ||32||

I am a perfect being, I am the master of the five senses. The results of my actions are not known to me, even though I know them. ||33||

Those who are wealthy, the sons of merchants, the sons of the wealthy, the great princes, they are my beloved, my deep desires. ||34||

Those who live in their homes, who are suffering from the pain of attachment, who are devoted to the Jinas, who are celebrating festivals, they are my beloved, they are my beloved. ||35||

Those who are fighting, who are being attacked, who are being defeated, who are being killed, who are being reborn in this world, who are suffering, I forgive them. ||36||

Food and shelter are my only needs, especially at the time of death. I bow down to the essence of the Jina's teachings, the supreme being. ||37||

Thus, for a moment, until the pure result of my actions is achieved, I will remain in this body, according to the will of the karma. ||38||

Oh, alas! Because of that cruel, insignificant, wicked king, my kingdom, which was unmatched in the world, has been destroyed. ||39||

Because of that king, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who was like a king of the gods, who

Chapter 2: Collection of Examples

The king, with his entourage, was approaching the Samvasarana.  The path was adorned with all the auspicious signs, befitting the occasion. ||9||  The Lord, in the past, had also made arrangements for this.  The gods had also arranged for the Samvasarana. ||10||  The king's orders were followed by the royal officials, without a moment's delay.  The king's words were the success of the earth, and his mind was like the gods. ||11||  The path of the king was not stained with the dust of saffron water.  The earth, adorned with flowers, did not become rough. ||12||  Golden pillars and arches were erected at intervals.  Platforms were built, adorned with rows of golden vessels. ||13||  They were decorated with various kinds of paintings, and with Chinese silks.  They were adorned with flying banners and with jeweled umbrellas. ||14||  Fragrant incense pots were placed in thousands, and garlands were hung from the pillars. ||15||  (Couplet)  The path was covered with a canopy of umbrellas, like the clouds in the sky.  It was made of a single cloth, with high poles. ||16||  Incense pots with flames were lit at every step.  The platforms were filled with the smoke of sandalwood and camphor. ||17||  Thus, having made the path like a section of heaven, the officials informed the king, who was eager to see the Lord. ||18||  The king, having bathed, was adorned with divine ornaments.  He wore clean clothes and garlands, and rode a magnificent elephant. ||19||  He was adorned with a white umbrella over his head, and with chowries on either side.  The king, like a king of the gods, moved majestically. ||20||  He was accompanied by thousands of his vassals, adorned with great ornaments.  The king, with his retinue, was like a god in his own form. ||21||  The chowries waved, and the king's wives, like defeated goddesses, looked like deer in the palace. ||22||  He was praised by groups of singers, and was sung by singers.  He was seen by those who knew him, and by those who adorned the path. ||23||  The king, surrounded by his retinue, entered a new pavilion.  He gradually reached the Samvasarana. ||24||  He circumambulated the Lord three times, and bowed down.  He sat down in his place, filled with the pride of wealth. ||25||  The Lord, knowing his pride, made a water-borne chariot, to teach him. ||26||  It was beautiful, with crystal-like edges, and with lotus flowers.  It was filled with the sound of peacocks and swans. ||27||  It was adorned with rows of heavenly trees and vines, and with blooming flowers.  It was adorned with blue lotuses, and with lapis lazuli gems. ||28||  It was adorned with emerald-colored lotuses, and with golden lotuses. ||29||  It was adorned with garlands of swaying waves, and with banners.  The king of the gods, Indra, ascended this water-borne chariot, with the gods. ||30||  (Four-line stanza)

## Chapter 280: The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

**Verse 31:**  
Honored by thousands of celestial women with chamaras, his ears were filled with the music of the Gandharvas, and his mind was filled with joy.

**Verse 32:**  
With his gaze fixed on the holy feet of his master, he descended from the heavens to the mortal realm, and became the lord of that place.

**Verse 33:**  
His feet rested on golden lotuses, adorned with emerald stems, like a mountain resting on a lotus.

**Verse 34:**  
His eight teeth were adorned with jeweled fangs, and his back was covered with the celestial dust of the gods, like the backs of the celestial elephants.

**Verse 35:**  
He was escorted by celestial women, who held his hands as he descended to the mortal realm, and then ascended to the city of Indra.

**Verse 36:**  
Filled with devotion, he approached the place of the Jina's feet, the crown jewel of the Vrindarakas.

**Verse 37:**  
Within the celestial chariots, adorned with lotus ponds, musical notes arose from the lotuses.

**Verse 38:**  
The celestial beings, each with a splendor matching Indra, became social, their divine forms beautiful and captivating.

**Verse 39:**  
The retinue of each god was magnificent, like the wealth of the Maghavas, a cause of wonder for the world.

**Verse 40:**  
Indra himself was amazed by the celestial chariots. What can be said of the others, whose wealth was no less?

**Verse 41:**  
The humans and gods present were amazed, and they saw Hari, the lord who had saved the earth, bowing again and again to the Lord.

**Verse 42:**  
Dasarnabhadra, seeing the wealth and splendor of Indra, was stunned for a moment, like a villager in a great city.

**Verse 43:**  
Dasarnabhadra, his eyes filled with wonder, thought, "Oh, how beautiful is this celestial chariot of Indra, the king of the heavens!"

**Verse 44:**  
"Oh, how beautiful is the body of this celestial elephant, the king of the gods! Oh, how vast is the wealth of Puruhuta, who is this?"

**Verse 45:**  
"This pride in my own wealth has blinded me. Alas, there is a vast difference between me and Indra, like the difference between a cow and a horse."

**Verse 46:**  
"By this pride in my wealth, I have made myself insignificant. I have become like a frog in a well, lacking in true wealth, before seeing this."

**Verse 47:**  
"As he thought this, his detachment grew, and the outcome was auspicious for the one who had done little karma."

**Verse 48:**  
"Although I have been defeated by Indra's wealth and power, I will defeat him today by taking the vow of renunciation."

**Verse 49:**  
"I will not only defeat him today by taking the vow, but I will also defeat the doers of karma, the wanderers in the cycle of birth and death."

**Verse 50:**  
Thinking this, the king of Dasarnapur, while still there, removed his crown, ornaments, and other adornments.

**Verse 51:**  
Dasarnabhadra, like one who cuts the roots of a karma tree, struck his head five times with his fists.

**Verse 52:**  
Indra, seeing this with eyes filled with

60. The story of Jitashatru, the king, and his wise minister, Subuddhi, as depicted in the _Upadesha Prasada_ (a Jain text), is a testament to the power of right faith. 

Jitashatru was the king of Champa. His minister, Subuddhi, was a true Jain, well-versed in the Jain teachings. One day, the king had a delicious feast prepared with divine-tasting delicacies. After enjoying the meal with his many courtiers, he exclaimed, "Oh, what a taste! Oh, what a fragrance!" and showered praise on the food. Everyone else, except Subuddhi, joined in the praise. The king then asked his minister, "Why don't you praise the food?" Subuddhi replied, "Your Majesty, I am not surprised by good or bad tastes. For, the _pudgalas_ (matter particles) can be fragrant or foul-smelling, tasty or tasteless, or even the opposite. Therefore, praise or criticism is not appropriate." The king did not believe him.

On another occasion, the king was going to the royal palace when he saw a ditch full of stagnant water, teeming with life and emitting a foul odor due to the sun's heat. He covered his nose with his cloth and said, "Oh, what a foul and disgusting water!" The minister said, "Your Majesty, do not criticize the water. With the passage of time, even the most undesirable can transform into the desirable." The king did not accept this.

Then, secretly, the minister had the stagnant water from the ditch collected in a cloth and poured into a _koraka_ (earthen pot). He purified it with _kataka_ powder and other substances. Then, he poured the purified water into new pots. After twenty-one days, the water became clear, pleasant, cool, and almost divine. He then had it poured into a fragrant vessel and presented it to the king's water carriers. In due course, they brought it to the king. The king, realizing the extraordinary qualities of the water, asked them, "Where did you get this?" They replied, "The minister gave it to us." The king asked the minister, "Tell me, how did this water come about?" The minister replied, "Your Majesty, if you grant me your protection, I will tell you." The king granted him protection, and the minister told him the whole story. The king did not believe him. Then, the minister had the water carriers repeat the process as described earlier. The king, seeing this, was amazed and asked, "How did you know this?" The minister replied, "Your Majesty, this is the transformation of _pudgalas_, as taught by the Jinas (Jain Tirthankaras) and confirmed by faith. Oh King! The _pudgalas_ have an unimaginable power and a nature to transform in many ways, remaining hidden. This power is revealed to those who have knowledge. But those who are veiled by ignorance, karma, and other obstacles cannot truly understand. Nevertheless, one must have faith in the teachings. For, in this world, there are two types of non-perception. One is the non-perception of non-existent things, like the horns of a rabbit. The second is the non-perception of existing things. This is of eight types.

1. **Due to extreme distance:** For example, a person who has gone to another village is not seen. Does that mean he does not exist? He does exist, but he is not perceived due to the distance. Similarly, the Meru mountain and other things beyond the ocean are not perceived.

2. **Due to the passage of time:** For example, our ancestors and the future Jinas like Padma-nabha are not

**On the Rejection of the Eager**

There are five [types of non-perception]. Just as an object placed inside a room is not perceived due to the covering, does that mean it doesn't exist? No, it does exist. Similarly, the far side of the moon is not visible due to the obstruction of the near side. Just as a wise person may not perceive subtle meanings of scriptures due to dullness of mind, even though they exist, so too, non-perception due to a covering. Just as planets and stars are not perceived due to the overwhelming brilliance of the sun, how can we say they don't exist? Similarly, in darkness, pots and other objects are not visible. Just as a handful of mung beans is not perceived when thrown into a heap of mung beans, or a handful of sesame seeds when thrown into a heap of sesame seeds, or salt and other things when thrown into water, even though they are present, how can we say they don't exist? Similarly, even though eight types of existing things are present, they are not perceived. Just as the existence of pudgala, jiva, etc., even though they are present and arise gradually, is not perceived due to the divergence of their nature, so too, it should be understood in all cases.

**Someone else said:** "The Devadatta, etc., mentioned here, who are in other countries, are not perceived by us, but they are perceived by some people in other countries. Therefore, their existence is known. But jiva, etc., are never perceived by anyone. How then can their existence be ascertained?"

**To this, it is said:** "Just as Devadatta, etc., are known to exist because they are perceived by some, so too, jiva, etc., are known to exist because they are perceived by the liberated ones. Just as atoms are always imperceptible, but are inferred from their effects, so too, it should be understood in all cases."

Thus, the king, having been enlightened by the arguments of the Siddhanta, and by the wise words of the sage, renounced his worldly desires. Gradually, both of them, having attained the state of Pravrajya, attained liberation.

**62. The lineage of Bhrigu and Yasas, as described in the Uttaradhyayanasutra, which is characterized by unwavering meditation.**

The two, who were friends in their previous birth, born from a painting, who were servants of the cowherds, who were devoted to the good, went to the world of the gods. From there, they fell down and were born as two brothers in a city called Ibhukula, which was established on the earth. There, they had four friends. After enjoying pleasures, and having heard the Dharma from the elders, all of them became Pravrajitas. After observing restraint for a long time, they renounced their attachments. After some time, all six friends were born as gods in the Saudharma Kalpa, in a celestial palace called Padmagulma, with a lifespan like that of a palpa. Of those four gods, excluding the two who were cowherd-born, fell down and were born in the Kuru country, in the city of Ishukara. The first one was born as the king of the Ishukara. The second one was born as the queen of the same king, named Kamlavati. The third one became the priest of the same king, named Bhrigu. The fourth one became the wife of the same priest. Her gotra was Vasishtha, and her name was Yasas. This Bhrigu, the priest, desired offspring with great longing. He worshipped many gods, and asked questions about auspicious times. The two, who were cowherd-born in their previous birth, knew this, as follows: "We will be the

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples
The Shravaka vows were accepted. The priest said, "O Lord! Will we have children or not?" The Sadhus said, "You will have two sons, and they will become monks in their childhood. You should not hinder them. They will become monks and enlighten the world." Saying this, the two gods went to their place.
Soon after, the priest's wife gave birth to two sons. Then the priest, along with his wife, left the city and settled in a remote village. There, the Brahmin woman gave birth, and two children were born. When they gained consciousness, they were taught by their parents to avoid the path of the monks, saying, "These shaven-headed Sadhus are seen, they kill children and eat their flesh, therefore, you should never be near them."
One day, the two children went out to play from that village. There, they saw the tired Sadhus on the path. Then, the two children, frightened, climbed a banyan tree. The Sadhus were about to eat the food they had brought earlier, under the same banyan tree. The children, who were sitting on the tree, saw their natural food and drink. Then they started thinking, "These are not child-eaters, but they eat natural food. We have seen such Sadhus somewhere." While thinking this, they remembered their birth. Then, they bowed to the Sadhus and went to their parents.
The parents were enlightened by the words spoken in their studies. The queen also enlightened the king who was greedy for wealth. Thus, all six beings, having accepted the vows of renunciation, attained liberation after attaining perfect knowledge.
62. The story of Metarya Muni, included in the commentary of the Avasyakahara, which is a continuous meditation.
In that city, there was a king named Chandavardhana. He had two wives - Sudansana and Piyadansana. Sudansana had two sons - Sagarachandra and Munichandra. Piyadansana also had two sons - Gunachandra and Balachandra. Sagarachandra was the heir apparent, and Munichandra was given the kingdom of Ujjain.
This Chandavardhana king used to stay in his palace for a month, until the lamp went out. His queen used to worry, "My husband is in the dark, he is suffering." When the lamp went out, the servants would light it with oil. It would burn until midnight, then they would light it again with oil, and it would burn until evening. Then they would light it again. The king, who was weak due to illness, died at night. After that, Sagarachandra became the king.
He said to his mother, "Take the kingdom, my sons will be born." She did not want the kingdom to be taken away. She saw the royal insignia shining in the mirror and thought, "I don't want my sons to get the kingdom. They are so young, I will kill them. She thought of various ways to kill them, but she could not find any. Then she sent a message to the charioteer, "You should send them to the forest tomorrow. If they cry, you should kill them with a sword."

## The Scattering of the Eager Refusal

A pigeon was seen by a king, who said, "I desire it." The pigeon was frightened, and previously, having been caught by a hunter with a net, it had been wounded by him. Afterwards, it said, "Oh, fragrant musk-deer, I have been caught." It flew away and went to the king. There were two princes who were fond of hunting. The king thought, "How will I feed these two with this pigeon?" So, he had the pigeon cooked and gave it to them. They were about to eat it, when a hunter arrived. The king, being wise, called for a physician. The physician was given gold and was made ready. Afterwards, the maid was called and asked, "By whom was it seen?" She said, "By a hunter, and he is very clever in his tricks." She was told, "Go! If you want the kingdom, give it to him. I am not bound by this world or the next, I am free." So, the kingdom was given to him and he was made king.

Another merchant came to Ujjain from a distant land. He asked, "Is there any peace here?" They said, "No, the king's son, the priest's son, and the merchant are all engaged in heresy." He went to Amarisen, where he was welcomed by the merchants. They honored the merchant and told the beggar, "Bring him." He said, "I am a beggar, and I have no wealth, but I have a good family." So, he was given a chariot. He went and saw the priest, and then he returned. He was standing there, and a great noise was made by the monks. The monks came out and cried out. He said in a loud voice, "What is this commotion?" The monks went out and locked the door. Then they said, "Lord, we are five." He agreed to accept them and they were admitted. They did not want to go out, and said, "We will fight." Two of them came out and attacked him. He fought them like wild animals, and then he broke down the door and went out. He was standing in the courtyard. The king was told, and he sent for him. The merchants said, "He has come from a distant land, we do not know him." They searched for him and found him in the courtyard. The king went and embraced him, but did not want to release him. If he were to release him, he would die. So, he asked him, "Tell me the truth." He was taken to a place where there was a pit, and he was thrown in. The king's son said, "This is my father's enemy." The priest's son said, "We are being destroyed by this man." He was thrown into the pit and died. He went to heaven. They said, "Whoever first sees him should be honored." The priest's son saw him first, and he was honored. He went to the king's palace and entered the queen's room. The queen was a prostitute. She asked, "Who are you?" He said, "I sell meat." She said, "Don't go anywhere else, I will buy everything." He brought her meat every day. Thus, he had many wives. He had a house and a place to stay. The queen was a miser. She told her son about him in secret. The queen's son was given to the miser.

Chapter - 2 Collection of Examples

Once, a certain king, having become angry with his wife, because she had been unfaithful, had her tied up and thrown into a well. The king's brother asked, "What happened?" The brother replied, "She has been unfaithful to me for twelve years." The king asked, "What should I do?" The brother replied, "Burn the king's palace." All the people were shocked and horrified. The king then gave the brother a goat. The brother milked the goat, and filled a bowl with milk. He then told the king to burn the palace, saying that the bowl would be filled with milk. What happened? The palace was not burned, and the bowl was filled with milk every day. The king asked, "Where is the milk coming from?" The brother replied, "The goat has gone, and we will give you milk from now on." He then brought a fragrant ointment and rubbed it on the king. The king asked, "What is this?" The brother replied, "The king is suffering from a mountain of sorrow. I will help him find the path of liberation." The king agreed. The brother then said, "Let's build a golden palace." The king agreed. The brother then said, "If you can bring the ocean here, and make the water pure, then I will give you the tenth part of my wealth." The king agreed. The brother brought the ocean, and made the water pure. The king was very happy and married his wife. The brother then brought many other things for the king to enjoy. The king enjoyed all these things for twelve years. After that, the brother taught the king the path of liberation. The king followed the path of liberation for twelve years, and attained liberation. He then went to the city of the king, and went to the house of the goldsmith. The goldsmith was making a golden statue of the king. The king saw that the goldsmith was using a very sharp tool to make the statue. The king then went to the house of the goldsmith's neighbor. The neighbor was begging for food. The king saw that the neighbor was very hungry. The king then went to the house of the goldsmith's neighbor's neighbor. The neighbor's neighbor was eating a very delicious meal. The king saw that the neighbor's neighbor was very happy. The king then went to the house of the goldsmith's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor. The neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor was very sad. The king asked the neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor why he was sad. The neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor said that he had lost his son. The king then went to the house of the goldsmith's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor. The neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor was very happy. The king asked the neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor why he was happy. The neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor said that he had found his son. The king then went to the house of the goldsmith's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor. The neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor's neighbor was very angry.

When suddenly Yamadeva will come to my doorstep, when he will take me on the long journey of births and rebirths! O Vitrag Jinendra! I have only one request for you, grant me the path of Samadhi-Bodhi at that time...ll1॥ It is said here, "He who abandons will attain," the Lord says, "He who abandons the fear of death will attain happiness!" This soul is filled with the womb-dwelling in this body, who will release it from the cage without death? I॥2॥ The black, formless pain of the disease at the time of death, awakens pain in the ignorant, and awareness in the wise! The wise thinks: This pain is the destruction of attachment to the body, it is a good tool, through it is death, the torment of existence! ॥3॥ For years and years, those who have performed severe austerities, those who have become brave warriors of restraint throughout their lives, carrying it on their shoulders, and who have revered the study and contemplation of scriptures day and night, the fruit of all that is one, in the end, Samadhi-death!
Who is the one who will release?

Appendix-1: Original Verses - Explanation for Children - Meaning and Explanation

**Desikkadeśavirodha**

A being who has attained right faith and is a *desikkadeśavirodha* (one who has renounced the world but not all vows) is said to be a *balapanditamaraṇa* (death of a child-sage) in the Jina teachings. ||1||

**Śrīvardhamāna**

In order to explain this to children, the story of the *āturapratyākhyāna* (refusal of the sick) is told. ||

**Explanation for Children**

In this world, all living beings are subject to illness. The ultimate goal of life is to attain liberation. This study will explain the nature of the ultimate goal of life.

**Original Verses - Explanation**

The disciple asks the teacher: "What should be the first topic of study in the scriptures?"

The teacher replies: "The first topic of study in this text is not a greeting. It is the *bhaktaparijñāna* (knowledge of devotees) as explained by Vīrabhadra Ācārya. He first attained *bhaktaparijñāna* and then performed the *āturapratyākhyāna*. Therefore, the first verse should be considered a greeting to the *bhaktaparijñāna*. This is because there is only one author of this text."

**Desikkadeśavirodha**

The sixth part of the six categories of beings is the *traskāya* (those who are subject to suffering). The *deśa* (world) is a part of the *traskāya*. There is a difference between the *deśa* and the *traskāya* because of the intention to harm. The *deśa* is a part of the *traskāya* that has renounced violence through intention. Therefore, there are two types of *deśa*: those who are guilty and those who are innocent. The *deśa* that has renounced the world through intention and is innocent is called a *desikkadeśavirodha*.

**Samyagdṛṣṭi**

The *samyagdṛṣṭi* (right faith) is a vision that is not contrary to the truth. A being who is a *śrāvaka* (lay follower) and dies with *samyagdṛṣṭi* is called a *balapanditamaraṇa* in the Jina teachings. This is because they have attained *samyagdṛṣṭi* and are therefore considered a *pandita* (sage), but they have not renounced all vows and are therefore considered a *bala* (child).

**Jina teachings**

There are many types of death in the Jina teachings, such as *āvicīmaraṇa* (death in hell). However, there are five types of death that are considered to be the most important. These are:

1. *Mithyātvīna balamaraṇa* (death of a being who has false faith as a child)
2. *Avirata samyagdṛṣṭīna balamaraṇa* (death of a being who has right faith but has not renounced all vows as a child)
3. *Deśaviratīna balapanditamaraṇa* (death of a being who has renounced the world but not all vows as a child-sage)
4. *Chhadmasthayatina panditamaraṇa* (death of a being who is pretending to be a sage)
5. *Kevalīna panditamaraṇa* (death of a being who has attained omniscience)

**Meaning**

A *śrāvaka* who

##  Chapter 290:  The Scattering of the Eager Rejection

**Verse 2:**
Five Anuvratas and seven Shikshavrata are the Yati Dharma from the land. All twelve Vratas together are called the Desayati Dharma. 

**Explanation:**
The five Anuvratas are those Vratas which are less than the Mahavratas. The seven Shikshavrata are those Vratas which are related to the constant practice. The three Gunavratas are also intended for daily practice. The twelve Vratas are called the Desayati Dharma for the Shravaka. Thus, all twelve Vratas together, including the Desayati Vratas, are called the Desayati Dharma for the Shravaka.

**Verse 3:**
* Restraint from killing, lying, stealing, and sexual misconduct, and restraint from unlimited desires are the five Anuvratas.

**Explanation:**
* **Pranavrat:**  The killing of ten kinds of beings is called Pranavrat. However, it does not mean killing any living being. It means that one should not kill any living being.
* **Musavrat:**  Speaking falsely due to anger or other emotions is called Musavrat.
* **Adattvrat:**  Taking anything without the owner's permission is called Adattvrat.
* **Paradaravrat:**  The inner qualities of a man are called his wife. The outer qualities of a man are called his wife. The wife of another man is called Paradar. Restraint from all these is called Paradaravrat.
* **Aparimitaichchavrat:**  The desire for unlimited possessions is called Aparimitaichchavrat. Restraint from this is the fifth Anuvrat.

**Verse 4:**
* Restraint from going in any direction and restraint from harmful actions are the Gunavratas.

**Explanation:**
* **Disavaramana:**  Restraint from going in any direction, especially the four cardinal directions, is the first Gunavrat. This restraint is from the attachment to the past.

Appendix - 1 Child Understanding - Meaning and Translation

**Verse 1**
Whoever holds the direction (Digvirman) in mind, gives protection to all beings.
The world is spreading, falling into the ocean of existence. || As per the saying ||

**Verse 2**
Similarly, the useless and purposeless punishment (Anarthadand) is the restraint of mind, speech, and body. The seed of that restraint is the Gunavrata. Similarly, the vow that is to be taken for life is called Desavakashik, which is a concise form of the Digvrat or the vow of direction, to be performed daily. The third Gunavrata is the Shikshavrata, although it is known as a Shikshavrata, it is considered a Gunavrata because it is beneficial to all vows. Therefore, it is said that there is no fault in considering it as a Gunavrata. || 4 ||

**Meaning:** The Digvirmanvrata, which is the restriction of going and coming in all directions, the Anarthadandvirmanvrata, which is the regulation of activities that lead to unnecessary sinful punishment for the soul, and the Desavakashikvrata, which is the concise form of all vows. These three vows are called Gunavratas because they are beneficial in observing the five basic vows. (4)

**Verse 3**
The enumeration of enjoyments, the Samayik, the Atithisambhag, and the Poshad are the four teachings. || 5 ||

**Verse 4**
It is said that the Shikshavrata is the teaching vow - The verse says - The enjoyment of food, etc., is to be enjoyed once. Similarly, the enjoyment of clothes, etc., is to be enjoyed repeatedly. The first Shikshavrata is to limit the number and quantity of these enjoyments. Similarly, the Gunavrata is also considered to be accepted for life. However, it is necessary to make it concise day by day, for the sake of daily practice. There is no fault in considering it as a Shikshavrata. Similarly, the Samayik, which is the practice of equanimity, is the second Shikshavrata. Similarly, the Atithisambhag, which is the giving of food, etc., to the worthy, whether a Sadhu or a Shravak, is the third Shikshavrata. Similarly, the Poshad, which is the strengthening of Dharma, is the fourth Shikshavrata. The method of this is "Savvau Aharposhan," etc. These four are called Shikshavrata. || 5 ||

**Meaning:** The regulation (concise form) of the objects of people and the world is the Bhogopabhog Virabhaye Vrata, the Samayikvrata, which is the practice of equanimity, free from attachment and aversion, the Atithisambhagvrata, which is the giving of gifts to worthy persons, whether a Sadhu or a Shravak, and the Poshadvrata, which is the four types of Poshad, which is the renunciation of food, etc. These four vows are called Shikshavrata because they are in the form of study. (5)

**Verse 5**
In eagerness, in death, in the unbroken, and in the desire to live, there is no such thing as a western leaning. || 6 ||

**Verse 6**
The one who is free from attachment and aversion, who is at home, who is not afraid to build a house, if he dies in a foreign land, that story is a child's story. || 7 ||

## Chapter 292: The Scattering of the Rejection of Anxiety

**Verse 6:**

A young scholar dies when death comes unexpectedly, while still clinging to the hope of living. Or, when the family has not given permission for the final rites, and the dying person passes away without performing the final rites, this is called a young scholar's death.

**Verse 7:**

A desaviratidhar Shravak who dies at home, having received the Aloi (purification) from the Guru, and having renounced the worldly attachments, is said to have died a young scholar's death.

**Verse 8:**

The method of death is described in detail in the "Bhattparitra" text. This method should be followed by the desaviratidhar Shravak who dies a young scholar's death.

**Verse 9:**

A Shravak who performs the rites of a young scholar's death will be reborn in the Vaimanika Kalpadevaloka, but not in the higher realms of the Graiviyaka. The Shravak who has not fully understood the Dharma will be reborn in the seventh or lower realms.

Appendix-1 Child-Understanding-Meaning Translator
293
Meaning: According to this method, a child-pandit who dies is born in the Vaimanika Devaloka, a celestial realm. He will definitely attain liberation from the seventh heaven and become a Siddha. (8)
This is the death of a child-pandit, as seen in the teachings of the Arihant.
Now, I will briefly explain the death of a pandit. (10)
I wish, O Venerable One! I will explain the best. 1-Aiyam Padi, 2-Anagayam Padi, 3-Pacchuppanna Padi, 1-Kayam Pid, 2-Kariyam Padi, 3-Anumoiyam Padi, 1-Micchatt Padi, 2-Asanjam Padi, 3-Kasay Padi, 4-Pavappog Padi, in the results of wrong perception, either in this world, or in the next world, or in the sentient beings, or in the non-sentient beings, or in the five sense objects.
Annanjana, Anayaram Jhana, Kudansan Jhana, Koh Jhana, Man Jhana, May Jhana, Lobh Jhana, Rag Jhana, Dos Jhana, Moh Jhana, Ichch Jhana, Micch Jhana, Muchch Jhana, Sank Jhana, Kank Jhana, Gehin Jhana, Asan Jhana, Tanh Jhana, Chuh Jhana, Panth Jhana, Panthan Jhana, Nijhana, Niyan Jhana, Neh Jhana, Kam Jhana, Kalus Jhana, Kalah Jhana, Jujh Jhana, Nijujjh Jhana, Sang Jhana, Sangah Jhana, Vavhar Jhana, Kayavikkay Jhana, Anathdand Jhana, Abhog Jhana, Anabhog Jhana, Anavil Jhana, Ver Jhana, Viyakk Jhana, Hins Jhana, Has Jhana, Pahas Jhana, Pao Jhana, Farus Jhana, Bhay Jhana, Ruv Jhana, Appasan Jhana, Paranind Jhana, Pargarih Jhana, Pariggah Jhana, Parparivay Jhana, Paradushan Jhana, Aarambh Jhana, Sanrambh Jhana, Pavanumoayan Jhana, Ahigarn Jhana, Asamahimarn Jhana, Kammodaypacchay Jhana, Iddigarav Jhana, Rasgarav Jhana, Sayagarav Jhana, Avareraman Jhana, Amuttimarn Jhana, for the one who is well-versed or the one who is awakened, if any god or king, who is the best, who is not greedy, who is not envious, who is not a liar, who is not a deceiver, for him, wrong perception is a great misfortune. (11)
Bala-Gatha - This Bala-Gatha is explained in this way. If it is said that a child-pandit has died, then it means that he has not attained complete cessation of all activities. If it is said that a pandit has died, then it means that he has not attained complete cessation of all activities. If it is said that a pandit has died, then it means that he has not attained complete cessation of all activities. If it is said that a pandit has died, then it means that he has not attained complete cessation of all activities. If it is said that a pandit has died, then it means that he has not attained complete cessation of all activities. If it is said that a pandit has died, then it means that he has not

## 294
## Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam

Bala:  If someone is taking sanlekhana, the guru should tell them what a pandit would say when they take the vow.  

Icchami:  I desire, O Bhagavan, to do anushana.  

They desire to do anushana, and this is what they should say first.

Padikkamami:  I am renouncing all sins in general.  I have committed sins in the past due to ignorance, carelessness, and other reasons, and I am renouncing them.

This is what they should say about renouncing sins in all three times.

Aiyan:  I am renouncing all sins committed in the past, in the form of repentance.

Anagayam:  I am renouncing all sins that I will commit in the future, in the form of avoidance.

Pacchuppaan:  I am renouncing all sins that I am committing in the present, in the form of restraint.

This is what they should say about the means of renouncing sins.

Kayam:  I am renouncing all sins that I have committed myself, or caused others to commit, or approved of, such as "May this enemy die," etc.

This is what they should say about renouncing sins that are bound by the marks of falsehood, non-restraint, passions, and non-yoga.

Michhattam:  Falsehood includes five types: false perception, false acceptance, etc.  Non-restraint is one type, and passions are many types.

Papaprayog:  I am renouncing all sins that I have committed through the body, speech, and mind.

Bala:  From the phrase "Michha dansan parinaamesu va" to the phrase "Padibudhass va," there are six parts.  If I have committed any sins against the gods, kings, the excellent, the good, the bad, the non-bad, I am renouncing them.  This is the first connection.  After this, the meaning is as follows:

Michha:  False perception means the determination of falsehood.  If I have committed any sins against the gods and kings, by transgressing, violating, abusing, or not abusing, I am renouncing them.  This is what they should say about all of this.  The meaning of transgression, etc., will be explained later.  

Ihalog:  If I have committed any sins against the human world, such as violence, etc., I am renouncing them.  

Paralok:  If I have committed any sins against the other world, such as against animals, etc., I am renouncing them.

Sachitte:  If I have committed any sins against things with consciousness, such as the earth, etc., I am renouncing them.

Achiitte:  If I have committed any sins against things without consciousness, such as a bad bed, a blanket, etc., by sleeping on them, or if I have desired to take gold, etc., I am renouncing them.

Panchasuk:  If I have committed any sins against the five senses, such as pleasure and displeasure in sound, form, smell, taste, touch, and mind, I am renouncing them.

If I have committed any sins due to ignorance, inattention, etc., I am renouncing them.  This is the connection of all of this.

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

**Rasagarava K.**  Good! If someone says that there is no one who enjoys the taste of delicious food, etc., then in this case, the wise king Jitashatru, who enjoyed the water of the ritual, should be cited as an example. ||60||

**Satagarava K.**  To make happiness flourish. To say, "There is no one happier than me in this world," etc. In this case, the example of Sisupal Raja should be cited. ||61||

**Aveeraman K.**  If someone says that there is no cessation of meditation, then in this case, like the priest Bhrigu, who kept his son in the knowledge of all cessation, but did not know that his son was a meat-eater, and said, "This one seems to be a good person, but he is a meat-eater," etc., this is the result of non-cessation. ||62||

**Amucti K.**  To not desire liberation or moksha. The meaning is the desire for worldly happiness. If someone desires worldly happiness and dies, then this is called "Amuctimaran." If someone meditates like this, then in this case, like the virtuous Chitra, who, while being in the world, was born in the position of a Chakravarti, desired that position and made it his own. ||63||

These 36 types of meditation are natural to the angry and cruel. They are suitable for those who are deceitful and have committed evil deeds. The anusvara (nasal sound) in all the words of meditation is to be understood as an alakshanika (unmarked) and should be omitted.

**Haveai**  If someone says that all meditation is in a particular state, then that state is called "Haveai."

**Pasuttas K.**  If someone is asleep or awake, and if he is involved in something for many days or a few days, or for many nights or a few nights, then this is called "Pasuttas."

**Uttamart K.**  If someone is involved in knowledge, etc., and if there is transgression, reversal, excess, or misconduct, then this is called "Michchami Dukkadam."

**Michchami Dukkadam K.**  This sin is false and fruitless.

**Haveai**  The meaning of transgression, etc., is explained here. If someone accepts the words of someone who invites him to eat food, etc., which is harmful, then this is called "Atikram." If someone goes to the house of the host to eat food, then this is called "Vyatikrama." If someone goes there and eats the food, then this is called "Atichaar." If someone brings the food and eats it, then this is called "Anaachaar." This is the meaning of these words. This method of false evil deeds is called "Balapanditmaran" and "Panditmaran." ||11||

**Artha Pandita**  A sage who desires the death of a pandit (learned person) should say this to his Guru Bhagvant while performing Pratikraman:

O Bhagvant! I am doing Anusana, which is the only cause of attaining liberation. To accept Anusana, first of all, I turn away from all kinds of sinful activities. Especially, I turn away from the sins of the past through condemnation, and I turn away from the sins of the future through understanding. I turn away from the sin of the present by giving up sinful activities. I turn away from the sins that I have done myself or have caused others to do. I turn away from the sin of approving my own or others' sins.

I renounce all the evil that has been done to me in the realm of false belief, in the realm of light, in the realm of the afterlife, in the realm of conscious beings, in the realm of non-conscious beings, or in the realm of the objects of the five senses.
Furthermore, I renounce the following: ignorance-meditation, misconduct-meditation, wrong-belief-meditation, anger-meditation, pride-meditation, delusion-meditation, greed-meditation, attachment-meditation, fault-meditation, infatuation-meditation, desire-meditation, false-belief-meditation, moustache-meditation, doubt-meditation, longing-meditation, greed-meditation, hope-meditation, thirst-meditation, nectar-meditation, path-meditation, departure-meditation, sleep-meditation, diagnosis-meditation, affection-meditation, lust-meditation, impurity-meditation, conflict-meditation, war-meditation, non-war-meditation, gathering-meditation, collection-meditation, transaction-meditation, victory-meditation, punishment-meditation, enjoyment-meditation, non-enjoyment-meditation, debt-meditation, hatred-meditation, debate-meditation, violence-meditation, laughter-meditation, mockery-meditation, arrogance-meditation, harshness-meditation, fear-meditation, form-meditation, self-praise-meditation, criticism-meditation, blindness-meditation, attachment-meditation, slander-meditation, pollution-meditation, beginning-meditation, end-meditation, approval-of-sin-meditation, argument-meditation, non-concentration-death-meditation, karma-arising-understanding-meditation, power-respect-meditation, taste-respect-meditation, saint-respect-meditation, non-stop-meditation, liberation-death-meditation.
As a result of these 13 evils, I renounce all the transgressions, violations, excesses, and misconduct that I have committed in the practice of knowledge, belief, and conduct, whether I was awake or asleep. (11)
I do this for the sake of the soul that desires liberation, and for the sake of all the Jinas, the conquerors of the world, and their followers. (12)
If anyone is engaged in virtuous conduct, and if by chance they encounter an obstacle, they should renounce it and reject it. This is what is meant by saying "I do this" and so on. This is what is meant by saying that I am offering my respects to the entire assembly. This is what is meant by saying that I am offering my respects to the Vardhamana Swami. The Vardhamana Swami is like a bull among the Jinas, and he is superior to all other Kevalis. Similarly, I offer my respects to the Tirthankaras, beginning with Rishabha, along with their followers. The word "cha" means that I am offering my respects to all the past and future Jinas. This is the first greeting, and it is offered to all 24 Jinas. (12)
Meaning: The soul that desires liberation first offers its respects to the Jinas. I offer my respects to the Vardhamana Swami, who is like a bull among the Jinas. I also offer my respects to all the Tirthankaras, beginning with Adinath, who are surrounded by their followers. (12)

The disciple then asked, "If these verses have already been said, why not say the third verse, which is about renouncing the three types of Samayik?" The teacher replied, "The third verse is implied in the verse that says, 'I renounce all living beings, all external objects, all food and drink, and all possessions.'

Appendix-1 Child Understanding-Meaning Translation
305
A worldly being, knowing that it is a living being, experiences the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which is a series of sufferings. What is this series of sufferings? It is the suffering arising from the association with the objects of the world, such as children, spouses, etc., which is the origin of the tree of Yama, and its growth. This is the suffering that arises from the association of the living being. And it is the experience of growth. Therefore, the desire for association with all objects is done through the three ways of mind, speech, and body. This is the verse. ||28||
Meaning: Until now, the living being has only experienced the series of sufferings arising from association. Therefore, I renounce the association with the objects of the world through mind, speech, and body. (28)
The fundamental qualities and the subsequent qualities, which I have not renounced due to negligence. I condemn all of them and I will not commit them in the future. ||29|| Child: It is said that negligence is a transgression. Verse: Fundamental qualities. Etc. Meaning: The fundamental qualities are non-violence, non-lying, etc. The subsequent qualities are purity of body, etc. I have been negligent in these fundamental and subsequent qualities.
I have not been a proper worshiper of the Arhat, and I have not followed the right path. Therefore, I condemn all my non-worship. I am giving myself the punishment of false karma. And I will not commit such non-worship in the future. This is what is said in the scriptures about condemning the past, controlling the present, and renouncing the future. This is the verse. ||29||
Meaning: I condemn all the transgressions I have committed due to negligence in the worship of the fundamental qualities, such as the great vows, and the subsequent qualities, such as the samiti and the secrecy. And I renounce committing such transgressions in the future. (29)
There are seven fears, eight prides, four recognitions, three respects, and thirty-three aspirations. I condemn all of them. ||30|| Child: And this is what is said about renunciation. Verse: Seven fears. Etc. Meaning: The seven fears are: 1-fear of this world, 2-fear of the next world, 3-fear of attachment, 4-fear of the unexpected, 5-fear of livelihood, 6-fear of death, 7-fear of disgrace. The eight prides are: 1-pride of caste, 2-pride of family, 3-pride of strength, 4-pride of beauty, 5-pride of austerity, 6-pride of knowledge, 7-pride of wealth, 8-pride of power. The four recognitions, the three respects, and the thirty-three aspirations are self-explanatory. The aspirations are the thirty-three aspirations of the Tirthankaras, etc., as mentioned in the scriptures. Or, the thirty-three aspirations of the Guru. And I condemn all the anger and hatred that I have committed. This is the verse. ||30||
Meaning: I condemn all the seven fears, eight prides, four recognitions, three respects, thirty-three aspirations, and anger and hatred. (30)

In knowledge, in vision, in conduct, you are unshakable in all four.
You are steadfast, skilled in the scriptures, unyielding, a repository of secrets. ||34||. Bala. If a student approaches a teacher, the teacher praises his qualities.  Verse-Knowledge etc. The meaning is that you are unshakable in five types of knowledge, in vision, in the destruction of passions, in the pacification of passions, and in conduct. You are also capable of performing the twelve types of atonement yourself, and you know the methods of making others perform them. You are also devoted to conduct. In all four, it means that you are devoted to the aforementioned knowledge, vision, conduct, and penance. But not in each one individually. You are also a brave warrior against the enemy.  And skilled in the scriptures, etc. The word "etc." refers to five types of atonement: 1-Scripture, 2-Hearing, 3-Command, 4-Conquest, 5-Conduct. You are skilled in the five types of atonement or in the principles of the scriptures. That is the meaning you should understand. And you are unyielding, a repository of secrets. You are like the ocean, deep. This is the meaning of the verse: "Approach a teacher with such qualities." ||34||.
Meaning: When asked who to approach for guidance, it is said that one should approach those who are established in knowledge, vision, penance, and conduct, who possess pure intellect, who are knowledgeable in the scriptures, and who are like the ocean in their ability to digest criticism. 42nd. (34)
If I have done anything wrong to you out of love, hatred, ingratitude, or carelessness,
I apologize for it in all three ways. ||35||. Bala. The student seeking guidance apologizes to the teacher. Verse-Love etc. The meaning is that you have done something out of love, hatred, or carelessness. You have done something out of gratitude, or you have done something out of carelessness, without knowing. The word "etc." refers to the offense you have committed against the venerable one. And "if I have done anything" means that I have spoken something that is a fault, a blemish, or a criticism of the venerable one. I apologize for it in all three ways - with my mind, speech, and body. This is the meaning of the verse. ||35||.
Meaning: I apologize for anything I have done or said to you (the teacher) out of love, hatred, ingratitude, or carelessness, in all three ways - with my mind, speech, and body. (35)

##  A Discourse on the Rejection of Eagerness

They say there are three types of death: the death of a child, the death of a child-scholar, and the death of a scholar. The death of a scholar is what the Kevalis (Omniscients) approve of. ||36||

**Explanation:** The child-scholar is one who is eager for non-eating (fasting) and thinks that is the essence of death. The verse says, "There are three types..." etc. There are three types of death of a Tirthankara. One is the death of a child, which is ignorant, devoid of renunciation and wisdom, and is the death of a child. The second is the death of a child-scholar, which is devoid of renunciation from the world. The third is the death of a scholar, which is the death of a scholar who is completely renounced. The death of a scholar is what the Kevalis approve of, meaning that it is the death that is similar to the Kevalis. ||36||

**Meaning:** There are three types of death in the scriptures. ||12n. Bh29|| 3 Ch. 1- Porna Bh25, 2- Death of a Scholarly Being, 3- Death of a Being in the Scholarly Stage. The death that the Omniscients approve of. Scholar Bh29. Vay. (35)

Those who are addicted to the eight passions, whose understanding is corrupted from the path of liberation, who are crooked in their views, and who die without mindfulness, are not called seekers of the highest good. ||37||

**Explanation:** This type of death is characterized by being attached to the eight passions, being corrupted from the path of liberation, being crooked in one's views, and dying without mindfulness. This is considered a death with faults. The verse says, "Those who are addicted to the eight passions..." etc. The meaning is that those beings who are addicted to the eight passions, whose understanding is corrupted from the path of liberation due to passions like attachment, aversion, etc., who are crooked in their views, and who die with a mind that is not in a state of mindfulness, such beings die in a state of unmindfulness. They are not seekers of the highest good. ||37||

**Meaning:** Those who are addicted to the eight passions, whose understanding is corrupted from the path of liberation, who are crooked in their views, die in a state of unmindfulness and are not called seekers of the highest good. (37)

Those who reject death will experience the misery of the heavenly realms in the future, will become those with rare understanding, and their cycle of existence will be endless. ||38||

**Explanation:** This verse explains the consequences of rejecting death. The verse says, "Those who reject death..." etc. The meaning is that those who reject death, as described in the previous verses, will experience the misery of the heavenly realms in the future. They will become those with rare understanding, meaning they will have difficulty understanding the true nature of reality. The word "kil" indicates certainty, and the word "anant" indicates that their cycle of existence will be endless. This means that they will experience countless deaths. ||38||

**Meaning:** Those who reject death will experience the misery of the heavenly realms in the future, will become those with rare understanding, and their cycle of existence will be endless. (38)

##  Chapter 310:  Discourse on the Rejection of the Eager

**Verse 41:**
The meaning of the verse is:  For those beings who die, the Jain teachings, the Bodhi, are rare.  This is because they are engrossed in false views, have not attained the knowledge of the path to godhood, and have not attained the pure state of consciousness.

**Verse 42:**
The meaning of the verse is:  Those beings who have attained right faith, but have not attained the knowledge of the path to godhood, and have attained the pure state of consciousness, when they die, the Bodhi becomes easy for them.

**Verse 43:**
The meaning of the verse is:  Those beings who are hostile to their teachers, are deeply attached to the 30 great delusions, are attached to the 21 passions, and have a corrupt character, when they die in a state of anger, they become beings of infinite cycles of rebirth.

**Verse 44:**
The meaning of the verse is:  Those beings who are not attached to the teachings of the Jinas, who do not follow the teachings of their teachers, who are weak and have not attained the pure state of consciousness, they become beings of limited cycles of rebirth.

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam

We are tossed about in the world of the lower beings, experiencing many deaths as a child. I will accept the death of a sage, along with faith and knowledge. ||47||

**Explanation:** The text states that the soul experiences many deaths as a child in the higher realms, lower realms, and the realm of lower beings. Therefore, the speaker, who is endowed with faith and knowledge, will accept the death of a sage. ||47||

**Note:** The term "lower beings" refers to the realm of animals, plants, and other non-human life forms.

## 

**Translation of the next verse:**

I will die the death of a sage, going to the liberation, for in the human realm, there are only pains. Considering these, I will die the death of a sage. ||48||

**Explanation:** The text advises the listener to accept the death of a sage, as it leads to liberation, while the human realm is filled with suffering. ||48||

## 

**Translation of the next verse:**

If suffering arises, then it should be endured with patience. What have I not experienced in this world, while wandering through it? ||49||

**Explanation:** The text encourages the listener to accept suffering with patience, as it is a natural part of life. The speaker reminds the listener that they have already experienced many hardships in their life, and therefore, they should not fear suffering. ||49||

**Appendix - 1 Child Understanding - Meaning and Translation**

**Verse 50**
In the cycle of the world, all beings are objects of my desire. I have consumed them and experienced their consequences, yet I have not found satisfaction. 

**Verse 51**
Just as fire is not satisfied by grass and wood, and the salt sea is not satisfied by thousands of rivers, so too, this living being cannot be satisfied by desires and pleasures. 

**Verse 52**
Due to the desire for food, fish fall into the seventh hell. Therefore, I do not even desire mental food, even in my thoughts.

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

**Verse 53:**
The previous meritorious deeds, devoid of non-violence, have been abandoned by me. Now, I embrace death, equipped with the intellect and wisdom, having purified the passions.

**Explanation:**
The term "previous meritorious deeds" refers to the three types of austerities: the highest (lasting twelve years), the medium (lasting twelve months), and the lowest (lasting twelve fortnights). The term "devoid of non-violence" indicates that these austerities were not performed with the intention of achieving non-violence. The term "purified the passions" refers to the elimination of the passions through meditation and self-reflection. The term "embrace death" refers to the practice of fasting unto death, which is a common practice in Jainism.

**Verse 54:**
Those who perform austerities without proper preparation and engage in fasting without proper guidance, fall prey to the consequences of their past actions.

**Explanation:**
The term "austerities without proper preparation" refers to the practice of austerities without proper knowledge and understanding. The term "fasting without proper guidance" refers to the practice of fasting without the guidance of a qualified teacher. The term "consequences of their past actions" refers to the karmic consequences of their past actions, which can lead to suffering in this life or in future lives.

**Verse 55:**
Therefore, a wise person should engage in austerities with a clear purpose, and should strive to cultivate the virtues of knowledge, vision, and conduct, without abandoning the path of liberation.

**Explanation:**
The term "austerities with a clear purpose" refers to the practice of austerities with the intention of achieving liberation. The term "cultivate the virtues of knowledge, vision, and conduct" refers to the practice of developing the three jewels of Jainism: right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. The term "without abandoning the path of liberation" refers to the practice of remaining steadfast in one's commitment to liberation.

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

Having obtained the auspicious, immortal, and previously unattained Jina-vayaṇa, I have embraced the path of liberation. Therefore, I do not fear death. (64)

**Dhirena vi mariyavvam, kauriseṇa vi avassa mariyavvam.**

The courageous must die, and the cowardly must die. Both must die, but it is better to die with courage. (65)

**Sīlena vi mariyavvam, nisīlena vi avassa mariyavvam.**

The virtuous must die, and the wicked must die. Both must die, but it is better to die with virtue. (66)

**Nāṇassa dassanassa ya sammattassa ya carittajuttassa.**

Whoever has attained knowledge, vision, right conduct, and character, will be liberated from the cycle of birth and death. (67)

Nikko.  And so, the first verse meaning - knowledge with special use is called 'jnana', and knowledge with general use is called 'darshan'.  Similarly, there are eight types of 'samyaktvam' like 'nishankita' etc.  Similarly, 'charitra' is also divided into eight types by the 'paniti' and 'guptinayi'.  The meaning of this division is that the 'sadhu' who uses 'sadhu' practices with caution, is freed from the cycle of birth and death.  || 67 ||
Meaning: The 'sadhu' who is equipped with 'jnana', 'darshan' and 'charitra' becomes free from the cycle of birth and death. (67)
'Chira usiya bhambhayari papphodeun sesayam kammam.'
'Eggars visuddha gachchai siddhim dhuy kileso.' || 68 ||
Bala.  The second verse meaning - it takes a long time, it is said that the 'brahmacharaka' who practices 'sadachara' for a long time, destroys the 'karma' and removes the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by destroying the 'karma' and removing the remaining 'karma' by

Appendix - 2: The Sixty-Two Evils Included in the Upadesha Prasada

The sixty-two evils are born from the suffering and anger of the world. I write their nature, from the second chapter of the Prakirna Sutra. || 1 ||

Clarification: The text of the Aupacchandhika Sutra is to be understood as "Annaanjanhe" and so on. Thus:

Ignorance-Meditation: Ignorance itself is the best, as there is no effort in explaining, teaching, etc. Thus, contemplation in the mind, like that of Vasudevacharya as mentioned in the fifth example, is not to be meditated upon. || 1 ||

Immoral Conduct: Evil conduct, meditation on it, like that of Vallara, who desires the arrival of his disciples, like that of Ashadha Suri, who desires to renounce the world due to the non-arrival of his disciples. || 2 ||

Wrong Vision: Like that of the Buddhists, etc., meditation on it is like that of the Surastra Shraddha. || 3 ||

Anger-Meditation: Like that of Kulavalaka, Goshalaka, Palaka, Namuchi, Shiva Bhuti, etc. || 4 ||

Pride-Meditation: Like that of Bahubali, Subhumi, Parashurama, etc., who are attached to their strength, land, and weapons. || 5 ||

Maya: Deception in the form of deceiving others, meditation on it is Maya-Meditation, like that of Ashadha Bhuti. || 6 ||

Greed-Meditation: Like that of Singha Kesari. || 7 ||

Attachment: It is merely attachment, and it is of three types: Kama Raga, Sneha Raga, and Drishti Raga. Kama Raga is like that of Vishnu Shri, Vikrama, and Yaso Raja. Sneha Raga is like that of Damannaka, the horse-owner, and the best of the merchants, who, upon hearing of the death of his son, had his heart burst. Drishti Raga is like that of Kapila, who, having come from the Brahma Loka, was attached to his own vision and said to his disciple, "You are delighted in the Asuras," etc. Meditation on it is not to be done. || 8 ||

Hatred: It is merely dislike, or the determination to harm others. Meditation on it is like that of Madhupinga, Pippalada, etc., or like that of Virakadeva in the Harivamsa. || 9 ||

Delusion: Delusion, meditation on it is like that of Balabhadra, who carries the body of Vishnu. || 10 ||

Desire: Excessive desire for the object of a desired benefit, meditation on it is Desire-Meditation, like that of Kapila, who, even after gaining a crore of gold, was still greedy for two beans. || 11 ||

Falsehood: Having a distorted vision, meditation on it is Falsehood-Meditation, like that of Jamali, Govinda, etc. || 12 ||

Fainting: Excessive attachment to a previously acquired kingdom, etc., like that of Kanakadhvaja, who killed his own children as soon as they were born. || 13 ||

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam

**44.**  A harsh and extremely cruel karma, its meditation is harsh meditation, like a monkey's towards a yoke-bearing bull, or like a gem-studded chariot towards a chariot.

**45.**  Fear, a nature like a sharp blade, residing within delusion, like the affliction of a beautiful flower on a bull elephant, for the father-in-law of Somila.

**46.**  It is formed, it is observed, from a mirror, thus its form is meditation, form meditation, and it is of two types: self-form meditation and other-form meditation. There, "My form is beautiful," is self-form meditation, like Sanatkumara's. Other-form meditation is like the two elder brothers, Sujyestha and Chelala, looking at a picture painted on a board by a painter.

**47.**  Self-praise meditation, like Vararuci, who, being praised by a cart-maker, desires praise for his own poetry, or like a chariot-maker showing his knowledge to a treasury.

**48.**  Other-blame meditation, like four thieves towards a crow.

**49.**  Other's pride, the exposure of faults in front of others, its meditation is other-blame meditation, like a gossiper who blames a weak flower-friend in front of the assembly.

**50.**  Attachment, in the form of wealth, grain, etc., its meditation is like the meditation of one who has lost wealth, for the sake of wealth, like Charudatta's, or like the meditation of the Muni-pati, the Muni-rodhaka-kunjika.

**51.**  The revelation of the faults of others, which are not real, other-slander, its meditation is other-slander meditation, like the slander of the mother-in-law towards Subhadra.

**52.**  The accusation of one's own faults, even though the other is not at fault, other-defamation, its meditation is other-defamation meditation, like the Jina-dasa-bha, who, towards Bhadra-vrishabha, says, "My husband was killed by this," thus falsely accusing herself.

**53.**  The beginning, the affliction of others, its meditation is beginning meditation, like Kurudu and Ut-kurudu, or like Dvaipayana.

**54.**  Arrogance, intense desire in objects, etc., its meditation is arrogance meditation, like a small boy who, even though he is observing a vow due to his mother's prohibition, still desires objects.

**55.**  Sin, like the service of another's wife, etc., its approval, "This is done by a worthy one," its meditation is sin meditation, like the people who approve, saying, "This one is a wealthy enjoyer, a bee-like being," etc.

**56.**  The place of the origin of sin, its meditation is place meditation, like Nandamanikara, who is devoted to the meditation of a well.

**57.**  Thinking, "This one will die due to lack of concentration," lack of concentration death meditation, like the unworthy guardian who, towards Skanda-acharya, first crushes a small one in a machine.

## Appendix-2: Thirty-Six Wrong Views (Triṣaṣṭidurdhāna)

**58.** **Karma-Udaya-Pratyaya-Dhyāna:**  Dhyāna (wrong view) based on the understanding of the arising of karma (karma-udaya). Even though it initially leads to auspicious results, it eventually leads to inauspicious results due to the arising of karma, like Viṣṇu.

**59.** **Ṛddhi-Gaurava-Dhyāna:** Dhyāna based on the pride of wealth and power (ṛddhi). Like Darśārṇa-Bhadra, it leads to the feeling of self-importance.

**60.** **Rasa-Gaurava-Dhyāna:** Dhyāna based on the pride of taste (rasa). It leads to the feeling of superiority, like "My taste is superior, what about others?" This is similar to the wise minister of the king who defeated his enemies, praising the taste of the food in front of the king who was unaware of the taste.

**61.** **Sāta-Gārava-Dhyāna:** Dhyāna based on the pride of comfort (sāta). It leads to the feeling of arrogance, like "I am the only one who is comfortable."

**2.** **Aviramana-Dhyāna:** Dhyāna based on the wrong view of not stopping (aviramana). It leads to the feeling of "Let there be no stopping for my sons." This is similar to the parents who told their sons, "These ascetics are meat-eaters and demons, so you should not go near them," and thus deceived them. Or, it is like the wise man who, even after being enlightened by the gods, repeatedly abandoned his renunciation.

**3.** **Amucti-Maraṇa-Dhyāna:** Dhyāna based on the wrong view of not being liberated (amucit). It leads to the feeling of "There is no liberation, only the pursuit of worldly pleasures." This is similar to the ascetic who, even after being repeatedly warned by his brother, continued to indulge in worldly pleasures and thus created the cause for his non-liberation.

**1.**  Having heard the nature of these wrong views, those who are wise should understand that they are conducive to false beliefs and wrong actions. They are all to be abandoned, as they are filled with numerous karmas.

Each with its own unique characteristics, leading to various births in the realms of **Naraya**, **Tiriya**, **Manuya**, and **Devata**. ||25||

In this world, I forgive all those who have wronged me,
Through their speech, actions, or thoughts.
May all forgive me as well, including myself. ||26||

In these three periods of time - the past, present, and future -
I forgive all those who have wronged me through their thoughts, speech, and actions.
This is the true path of non-violence. ||27||

[Verses 28-30: Attaanusatti]
I am alone, I belong to no one, and no one belongs to me.
With this unwavering mind, I guide myself. ||28||

My only teacher is my own self, guided by knowledge and insight.
All other external influences are merely signs of attachment. ||29||

The cycle of suffering arises from the attachment to existence.
Therefore, I renounce all attachments, in all three realms. ||30||

**Appendix-4: Minor and Major Sins (2)**

**[Verse 1: Introduction]**
Dwelling in the wrong path, with a mind attached to the objects of sense,
The minor and major sins, these are the things that bind us. ||1||

**[Verses 2-3: Non-Virtuous Sins]**
All killing of living beings, all violence, all taking of what is not given,
All lying, all stealing, all wrong conduct, all wrong thoughts. ||2||
In the case of wives, in the case of children, in the case of parents, in the case of relatives,
In all beings, attachment to self, this is the sin that binds me. ||3||

**[Verses 4-5: Wrong Conduct]**
In hell, those who are in hell, in the animal realm, those who are in the animal realm,
Bound by suffering, I am bound by wrong conduct, this is the sin for them. ||4||
In the realm of gods, those who are gods, in the human realm, those who are humans,
Bound by suffering, I am bound by wrong conduct, this is the sin for them. ||5||

**[Verses 6-13: Attachment to Self]**
In the realm of gods, many are the palaces, adorned with jewels,
With beautiful women, with fine clothes, with beautiful chariots, with beautiful horses. ||6||
With diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls, with beautiful gardens, with beautiful mansions,
With beautiful music, with beautiful scents, with beautiful food, with beautiful drinks. ||7||
With mountains of jewels, with beautiful ornaments, with beautiful bows and arrows,
With beautiful chariots, with beautiful horses, with beautiful elephants, with beautiful armies. ||8||
Those who are gods, those who are like gods, those who are like the gods,
Do not be attached to them, do not be attached to them, do not be attached to them. ||9||
With beautiful jewels, with beautiful clothes, with beautiful flowers, with beautiful scents,
Do not be attached to them, do not be attached to them, do not be attached to them. ||10||

This body is filled with foul odors, and is full of bile, phlegm, and blood. O living being! Do not attach yourself to this body. ||11|| Do not desire the riches of heaven, nor the pleasures of the world. O good man! Do not worry, whatever is destined to happen will happen. ||12|| The living being experiences both good and bad, but this body is not permanent. Where will it go? ||13||

**[Verse 14-18. Dehasas Uvalambho]** Do not think that this body will be your support in the future. O body! You are a deceiver! Why have you taken me in with your pleasures? ||14|| Do not think that you will find water in the desert. O body! You are a deceiver! Why have you taken me in with your pleasures? ||15|| Do not think that this body will be your shelter. O body! You are a deceiver! Why have you taken me in with your pleasures? ||16|| Do not think that you will be clothed in fine garments and blankets. O living being! You are bound to the deceiver, and you cannot escape. ||17|| Even though you are adorned with many ornaments, and have a pleasant fragrance, O body! You cannot give me even a drop of water when I need it. ||18||

**[Verse 19-25. Suhbhavna]** In this world, filled with suffering, and surrounded by human beings, true happiness is rare, and the path of righteousness is even rarer. ||19|| I am fortunate to have found the teachings of the Jina, which are rare even in the ocean of existence. ||20|| You have experienced many kinds of suffering in the animal realm. Remember those sufferings and endure this suffering. ||21|| O living being! You have experienced many kinds of suffering in hell. Remember those sufferings and endure this suffering. ||22||

Appendix-4: Confession of Minor Sins

331
This (or so) is the good result, the wise one, having known, controls the body.  He is praised in the heavenly world, I confess everything. ||23||
As long as I do not renounce the minor sins with my body, as long as there is doubt, I will renounce this Jain religion, I will make my mind impure. ||24||
Therefore, if a person commits minor sins, it will be harmful to the body.
At the time of death, I will remember the Arhat, I will attain liberation. ||25||
[Ga. 26-34. Confession of remembering the Arhat, confession of minor sins, confession of wrong beliefs]
I bow to the Arhats, I bow to the Siddhas, I bow to the liberated ones.
I bow to the Aayariyauvazhāyās, I bow to all the virtuous ones. ||26||
I confess to violence, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, possession, and wrong beliefs. I confess to the various types of food and drink at the time of death. ||27||
The ultimate truth is not the body, the body is not the source of happiness, the earth is not the source of happiness. The heart that is pure, that is the source of happiness. ||28||
One being is born, one being dies, one being is reborn. One being wanders in the cycle of birth and death, one being attains liberation. ||29||
I confess to my own shortcomings in knowledge, vision, and conduct. I confess to all the remaining bad qualities. ||30||
Those who know me as a Jain, I confess to them in every place. I confess to them in every way. ||31||
The foolish mind, with its six senses, collects so much. I do not remember it, I confess to this wrong belief, this is my suffering. ||32||
If I have pride in this body, in this beautiful body, in this beautiful body, I confess to it. I confess to eating food, to the body, to the previous bad deeds. ||33||
...previous bad deeds. I confess to all three types of bad qualities at the time of my last breath. ||34||
|| Confession of Minor Sins is complete. ||3||

Appendix-7: Verses from the Digambara Mulachara Grantha on the Rejection of the Sick.

**Verse 17**

The author of the text, having made the rejection of the sick a separate chapter, explains the meaning of the second chapter, which is titled "Rejection of the Sick." Alternatively, there are six periods for the ascetics, of which three are for self-purification, renunciation, and the highest state of being, which are mentioned in the context of worship. The remaining three periods, initiation, instruction, and the maintenance of the community, are mentioned in the context of conduct. In the first three periods, if death occurs, then the author says, "I have made such a transformation."

**Translation of Verse 37:**

"I bow down to the Siddhas, who are free from all suffering, and to the Arhats. I believe in the teachings of the Jinas and reject all that is sinful."

**Explanation:**

* **Sava-dukkha-ppa-hi-na-na-m:** Those who are free from all suffering, all afflictions, and all dualities. Alternatively, those who have overcome all suffering.
* **Sid-dha-na-m:** To the Siddhas, those who have attained the eight perfections of omniscience, etc.
* **Ara-ha-do:** To the Arhats, those who have attained the nine Kevala Jnanas (omniscience). The word "cha" (and) is implied here.
* **Na-mo:** I bow down to them.
* **Sad-dha-he:** I have faith in.
* **Jin-pan-na-ttam:** The teachings of the Jinas, the teachings of those who have conquered their karmas.
* **Pac-cha-kha-mi:** I reject, I avoid.
* **Pa-va-yam:** Sinful, that which causes suffering.

Therefore, I bow down to the Siddhas and Arhats, who are free from all dualities. I have faith in the teachings of the Jinas, which are based on omniscience, and I reject all sin. Alternatively, the word "namas" (bow down) is in the past tense in Prakrit, which is implied by the rule of elision. Therefore, the meaning is: I bow down to the Siddhas and Arhats, and I have faith in the teachings of the Jinas, and I reject sin. Alternatively, the word "namas" is in the present tense, and the connection is as follows: I bow down to the Siddhas and Arhats, who are free from all suffering, and I have faith in the teachings of the Jinas. I reject sin. This is an example of the principle of anekanta (multi-facetedness), which allows for multiple interpretations of the same event.

**Verse 18**

The author again bows down to the Siddhas, emphasizing their greatness.

**Translation of Verse 38:**

"I bow down to the Siddhas, who are free from all suffering, and to the great ones. I reject all that is contrary to the teachings of the Kevalis."

**Explanation:**

* **Na-mo-tthu:** I bow down.
* **Dhu-da-pa-va-na-m:** Those who are free from all suffering.
* **Sid-dha-na-m:** To the Siddhas.
* **Cha:** And.
* **Ma-he-si-na-m:** To the great ones.
* **San-tha-ram:** That which is contrary to.
* **Pa-di-vaj-ja-mi:** I reject.
* **Ja-ha:** As.
* **Ke-va-

Or, two authorities are established by the rejection of the layers, or two scriptures are taken, and one authority is made from them, how is it known? From the performance of two salutations.

For the purpose of carrying out the vow, it is said:

**Aatur Pratyakhyan Prakirnakam**
**Aatur. Ga. 21**
I renounce all acts of violence, and all harsh words. I renounce all taking of what is not given, and all sexual desire and attachment. 
**Aatur. Ga. 22**
It has been said that I practice Samayika, but what is its nature? Therefore, it is said:
I have equality towards all beings, I have no enmity towards anyone. I renounce all desires and attain Samadhi.
**Aatur. Ga. 23**
I not only renounce enmity, but also all that gives rise to enmity. Therefore, it is said:
I renounce attachment, aversion, joy, sorrow, and the desire for comfort. I renounce anxiety, fear, grief, pleasure, and displeasure.

Aatur. Ga. 24
I abandon self-attachment, I am a knower of non-self-attachment.
My support is the Self, the rest I abandon. ||45||
Mamatti-self-attachment. Parivjjaami-parivarjaami, I abandon. Nimmamati-nirmammatvam, non-self-attachment, non-attachment. Uvatthido-upasthita, present. If everything is abandoned by you, what will be your support? Therefore it is said-Aalambanam cha, support. Me-my. Aada-Self. Avasesai-the rest, the many. Vosare-I abandon. What is the point of saying much? Abandoning everything else, I abandon the three jewels of knowledge, vision, happiness, and strength, etc. Aatur. Ga. 25
Why is the Self not abandoned by you? Therefore it is said-
The Self is clear in my knowledge, the Self is in my vision, conduct, and character.
The Self is in my renunciation, the Self is in my restraint, and in my effort. ||46||
Aada-Self. Hu-clearly. Majjha-my. Naane-knowledge. Aada-Self. Me-my. Dansane-vision, faith in the truth, light. Charitte ya-conduct, and in the cessation of sinful actions. Aada-Self. Pacchakkhane-renunciation. Aada-Self. Me-my. Samvare-restraint of the karmic influx. Joee-yoga, auspicious activity. Aatur. Ga. 26
This one dies, this one is born.
For this one, birth and death are one, this one becomes pure. ||47||
Eoy-one, alone. Marai-dies, abandons the body. Jeevo-living being, characterized by consciousness. Eoy-one. Uvavjjaai-is born. Eyassa-of this one. Jaai-birth. Maranam-death. Eoy-one. Sijjhai-becomes liberated. Neero-pure, without karma. Aatur. Ga. 27
This one is my eternal Self, characterized by knowledge and vision.
The rest are external phenomena, all characterized by attachment. ||48||
Eoy-one. Me-my. Sassao-eternal, permanent. Appa-Self. Naanadansanalakkhano-knowledge and vision, characterized by knowledge and vision. Sesaa me-the rest, the body, etc.

**Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam**

**Me:** External-external are non-self. They are objects of existence. All-all are complete. They are characterized by conjunction. The conjunction of non-self with self is conjunction, and conjunction is the characteristic of those who are perishable. In knowledge, vision, conduct, renunciation, restraint, and yoga, I am the self, because I die and am born as one, because one dies and is born, because one, being water-born, attains perfection, because all other objects of existence are external, characterized by conjunction, therefore, I am the only self, characterized by knowledge and vision, eternal.

**Aatur:** **Verse 28:** Now, why is the object of existence characterized by conjunction abandoned? To this, he says:

**Verse 49:** Conjunction is the cause, by the self, the chain of suffering is obtained. Therefore, I abandon all conjunctions with the three-fold body.

**Explanation:** Conjunction is the cause, by the self, the chain of suffering is obtained. Therefore, I abandon all conjunctions with the three-fold body (mind, speech, and body).

**Aatur:** **Verse 29:** Again, for the sake of abandoning bad conduct, he says:

**Verse 50:** The fundamental virtues and the secondary virtues, which are not practiced by me due to negligence, I condemn them all, I renounce them, and I will renounce them in the future.

**Explanation:** The fundamental virtues and the secondary virtues, which are not practiced by me due to negligence, I condemn them all, I renounce them, and I will renounce them in the future.

Appendix - 7 Root Conduct Comparison Verses
Patient Verse 30
Why are the faults not abandoned? If they are not abandoned, then I will abandon them.
Seven fears, eight prides, four recognitions, three dignities, thirty-three enjoyments, and attachment and aversion, I abandon. || 52 ||
Patient Verse 31
Thus
Seven fears - seven fears (1) Eight prides - eight prides (1) Four recognitions - four recognitions (food, sex, possessions, and desires). Dignities - dignities (wealth, taste, beauty, and pride in the world). Three - three. Thirty-three enjoyments - thirty-three things with which there is connection. Thirty-three things, enjoyments - enjoyments, insults, these are thirty-three enjoyments, or because they are the cause of them, they are called by that name. Attachment and aversion - attachment and aversion, pleasure and displeasure in oneself and in others. I abandon - I abandon, I do not practice.
I abandon the seven fears, eight prides, four recognitions, three dignities, thirty-three enjoyments, and attachment and aversion.
Unrestrained, ignorance, wrong belief, all that is mine, in living beings and non-living beings, I condemn and abandon. || 51 ||
I
Unrestrained - unrestrained, the cause of sin. Ignorance - ignorance, the perception of things without faith. Wrong belief - wrong belief, faith in what is not true. All that is mine - all that is mine. Mine - mine, the feeling of self in the non-self. In living beings and non-living beings - in living beings and non-living beings. I condemn - I condemn. That too - that too. I abandon - I abandon, I reveal it to others. I condemn and abandon all that is not worshipped in the root, middle, and fruit virtues, in the past, present, and future, due to negligence. I condemn and abandon all unrestrained, ignorance, wrong belief, etc., in living beings and non-living beings, and mine. Thus, the faults are abandoned due to the fault of negligence.
Patient Verse 32
After the time of self-reflection, the Acharya said to the monk for the purpose of discussing renunciation.
I condemn and abandon all that is condemnable to me. I examine everything inside and outside. || 55 ||
341
I condemn - I condemn, I reveal to myself. Condemnable - condemnable, worthy of being revealed to oneself. I abandon - I abandon, I reveal to the Acharya and others. That which - that which. Mine - mine. Condemnable - condemnable

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

It is blameworthy to be revealed to others. I examine, I criticize, I censure, and I blame after examining the conduct and behavior. All, without exception. All internal and external. I examine the basis and the attachment. I censure what is censurable, I blame what is blameworthy, I examine everything, both external and internal, and the basis. Aatur. Ga. 33

How should one examine? If you ask this, then it is said:

> Just as a child, speaking, speaks of what is right and what is wrong, straightforwardly,
> So should one examine, having abandoned illusion and falsehood. || 56 ||

Just as. Child. Speaking. What is right. What is wrong. Straightforwardly. Speaks. So. Should be examined. Illusion and falsehood. Having abandoned. Just as a child, speaking, speaks of what is right and what is wrong, straightforwardly, so should one examine, having abandoned illusion and falsehood. Aatur. Ga. 34

If you ask, "Whose conduct should be examined?" then it is said:

> In knowledge, in vision, in austerity, and in conduct, he is unshakable in all four.
> He is a hero, skilled in the scriptures, not a gossip, and a keeper of secrets. || 57 ||

In knowledge. In vision. In austerity. In conduct. In all four. Unshakable. Hero. Skilled in the scriptures. Not a gossip. Keeper of secrets. He who is firmly established in knowledge, vision, austerity, and conduct, in all four, who is not a gossip, who is a hero, and who is skilled in the scriptures, his conduct should be examined, not anyone else's. Aatur. Ga. 35

One who desires to seek forgiveness after examination, says:

> Whatever I have done wrongly, through attachment, through aversion, through negligence,
> Whatever has been said to me, I forgive it all. || 58 ||

Through attachment. Through aversion. Whatever I have done wrongly. Through negligence. Whatever has been said to me. I forgive it all.

343
Or. Whatever ungratefulness was done by me due to negligence, whatever was spoken by me, I forgive all of it.  Because of attachment and aversion, whatever ungratefulness was done by me, whatever was spoken by me, I forgive all of it. 

A sick person asks, "Having taken the vow of non-violence, a person who desires to renounce the world asks about the different types of death. How many types of death are there?" The Acharya said:

There are three types of death, they say, for the ignorant, the partially enlightened, and the fully enlightened. 

The third type of death is the death of the enlightened, which the liberated souls experience. 

The Arhat Bhattarakas and the Ganadharas also say that there are three types of death. The first is the death of the ignorant, because they are under the control of their ignorance. The second is the death of the partially enlightened, because they are under the control of their partial enlightenment. The third is the death of the enlightened, which the liberated souls experience. 

The partially enlightened also experience the death of the enlightened, because they are not different from the fully enlightened in terms of their general control over their senses. 

The death of the ignorant is not mentioned here because it is not relevant. 

Those who have a pure understanding of knowledge and perception experience these types of death. 

A sick person asks, "What about those who are not like this?" The next verse answers this question:

Those who have lost their minds, whose consciousness is unstable, and who are crooked in their ways, die without being called "worshippers." 

Those who have lost their minds, whose consciousness is unstable, and who are crooked in their ways, die without being called "worshippers."

**Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam**

**Aatur. Ga. 38** When asked, "What happens at the time of death?", the Acharya said:

> "At the time of death, when right faith is destroyed, heavenly rebirth is difficult to attain, and enlightenment is also difficult to attain. Indeed, the cycle of existence is endless, and it will continue in the future."

**Explanation:**

* **Mranē:** At the time of death.
* **Virahiē:** Destroyed, lost. Here, it refers to the loss of right faith at the time of death.
* **Dēvaduggāī:** Heavenly rebirth, birth in the realm of gods, celestial beings, or those who dwell in the heavens.
* **Dullhā y:** Difficult to attain, hard to achieve.
* **Kir:** Indeed, truly. This word has many meanings, but here it indicates that this is what is stated in the scriptures.
* **Bōhī:** Enlightenment, right faith, or the three jewels (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct).
* **Samsārō y:** The cycle of existence, the four realms of existence (gods, humans, animals, and hell beings).
* **Aṇantō:** Endless, infinite. It is infinite because it is the object of omniscience.
* **Hōī:** Becomes, exists.
* **Puṇō:** Again, once more.
* **Āgamē kālē:** In the future, in the time to come.

**Meaning:** When right faith is destroyed at the time of death, heavenly rebirth becomes difficult, enlightenment is also difficult to attain, and the cycle of existence, which is endless, will continue in the future.

**Aatur. Ga. 39**

In connection with this, the following sutra is asked as a question:

> "What are the heavenly rebirths, what is enlightenment, and what causes death to be misunderstood? What causes the soul to wander in the endless cycle of existence?"

**Explanation:**

* **Kā dēvaduggāīō:** What are the heavenly rebirths? What are the specific types of heavenly rebirths?
* **Kā bōhī:** What is enlightenment?
* **Kēṇ v:** By what, by what cause?
* **ṇ bujhae:** Does not understand, does not comprehend.
* **Mranam:** Death.
* **Kēṇ v:** By what cause?
* **Aṇanta pāre:** Endless, infinite, without limit.
* **Samsārē:** In the cycle of existence.
* **Hiṇḍae:** Wanders, travels, goes.
* **Jīvō:** The soul, the living being.

**Meaning:** O Bhattaraka! What are the heavenly rebirths, what is enlightenment, and what causes death to be misunderstood? What causes the soul to wander in the endless cycle of existence?

**Aatur. Ga. 40**

When asked by Kṣapaka, the Acharya said:

> "Attachment to sensual pleasures, excessive pride, and demonic delusion - these are the causes of heavenly rebirth being lost at the time of death."

**Explanation:**

* **Kandapa mābhijōggam:** Attachment to sensual pleasures.
* **Kibbis:** Excessive pride.
* **Sammōham āsurattāṁ cā:** Demonic delusion.
* **Tā dēvaduggāīō:** These heavenly rebirths.
* **Mranammi virahiē hōnti:** Are lost at the time of death.

**Meaning:** Attachment to sensual pleasures, excessive

Appendix-7 Root Conduct Comparison Verses:
345
If the essence of the substance and the essence of the emotion are considered to be the same, then this is said: Kandappa - the essence of Kandarpa, the quality of Kandarpa that is prone to attraction. Abhijogganga - the essence of Abhiyoga, the Abhiyogyantantra, the practice of mantras and other things that are frightening and terrifying. Kibbis - the essence of Kilvisha, the Kailvisha, the practice of unfavorable conduct. Sammoham - one's own delusion, the essence of one's own delusion, the state of being deluded, the delusion like the delusion of a dog, the one who has the delusion of the rise of the Vedas, the essence of that is the state of being deluded, the state of being deluded with delusion, the meaning of the state of being deluded. Asuratta - the state of being an Asura, the essence of an Asura, the state of being an Asura, the practice of conduct that is accompanied by the outcome of anger. Ta - these. Devaduggaio - the evil destinies of the gods, these are attained by those qualities, therefore the designation, because the cause is treated as the effect. Maranamma - at death, at the time of death, in the state of right faith, Virahie - in the state of being rejected, in the state of being despised. Honti - they become. In the state of right faith, when it is destroyed at the time of death, these Kandarpa, Abhiyogy, Kilvisha, self-delusion, Asura, and evil destinies of the gods become. Atur. Ga. 41, explaining the enlightenment through the door of difference, he says:
Micchadasanaratta sanidana kinhalelesamogadha.
Iha je maranti jiva tesim pun dullha bohi. ||69|| Micchadasanaratta - those who are attached to the wrong view, those who are fond of the untrue meaning. Sanidana - those who have a desire to speak with a cause. Kinhalelesam - the practice of yoga that is attached to the infinite number of karmas that are like black specks. Ogadha - those who have entered into the outcome of anger. Iha - in this. Je - those. Maranti - they die, they abandon their lives. Jiva - living beings. Tesim - of them. Pun - again. Dullha - difficult to obtain. Bohi - enlightenment, the auspicious outcome that is accompanied by right faith. In this, those living beings who are attached to the wrong view, who have a desire to speak with a cause, and who have entered into the practice of yoga that is attached to the infinite number of karmas that are like black specks, die, for them, again, enlightenment is difficult to obtain. The best explanation is that enlightenment is not destroyed even by the mere change of half of the pudgala, therefore, its identity with enlightenment, therefore, the characteristic of enlightenment is explained. Atur. Ga. 42, he explains the characteristic of enlightenment through the connection:
Sammainsanaratta aniyana sukkalesamogadha.
Iha je maranti jiva tesim sulha have bohi. ||70|| Sammainsanaratta - those who are attached to the right view, those who are fond of the true meaning. Aniyana - those who do not have a desire for this world or the next world. Sukkalesam - in the practice of yoga that is attached to the infinite number of karmas that are like white specks. Ogadha - those who have entered into the practice of yoga that is attached to the infinite number of karmas that are like white spec

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakiirnakam
## Bohi-Bodhi:

Here, those souls who are attached to right faith, are not afflicted by karma, and have entered the white stage of karma, when they die, they easily attain enlightenment. Although the meaning of this has been understood from the previous sutra, this is a repetition for the sake of collecting the meaning of the substance, the meaning of the synonyms, and the disciples. It is also for the sake of completely negating the opposite view. Aatur. Ga. 43, while explaining the nature of the cause of samsara, says:

> "Those who are opposed to the gurus, are full of delusion, are wicked, and are attached to the impurities, and die without concentration, they become bound to infinite samsara." (71)

> "Those who are opposed to the gurus, are full of delusion, are wicked, and are attached to the impurities, and die without concentration, they become bound to infinite samsara." (71)

Appendix-7: Comparison of Fundamental Principles:

Aatur. Ga. 45 If there is no devotion to the words of the Jinas, then what would be the result? It is said:
Many are the deaths of children, many are the deaths that are not desired.
Those who do not know the words of the Jinas, they are unfortunate. ||73||
Balamaranaani - The deaths of children, the deaths of those who do not have the taste for truth.  The giving up of the body is balamaranaani. Bahuso - Many, many types. Bahuaani - Many, abundant. Akamayaani - Not desired, not done by desire. Maranaani - Deaths. Marihanti - They will die, meaning they will attain death. Te varaaya - Those who are unfortunate, those who are helpless. Je jinavayanam - Those who know the words of the Jinas, the omniscient knowledge. Na jaananti - They do not know, they do not understand. Those who do not know the words of the Jinas, they are unfortunate, they will attain many types of deaths, many deaths that are not desired.
Aatur. Ga. 46 Then what are those deaths of children? It is said:
Taking up a weapon, eating poison, burning, entering water.
Those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, they are bound by birth and death. ||74||
Saththaggahanam - Taking up a weapon, killing oneself with a weapon, taking up a weapon. The death that arises from taking up a weapon is also taking up a weapon, because of the relationship between action and cause. Visabhakkanam - Eating poison, consuming a substance that is deadly poison, eating poison, the relationship is the same. Cha - Conjunction. Jalanam - Burning, the burning that arises from fire. Jalappaveso ya - Entering water, immersing oneself in water, drowning, entering water, the death that arises from this, or it itself. Anayarabhandasevi - Those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, unrighteousness is not righteousness, it is sinful action, the vessel is the object, they serve it, thus they are those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, the relationship is with death. Or, the relationship is with the person, they are those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness. Jammanamaranaanubandhiini - Birth, origin, death, the relationship between them, offspring, those who have this, they are bound by birth and death, meaning they are the causes of samsara. These deaths are bound by birth and death, they are those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, therefore they are the deaths of children. Or, these deaths are those who serve the vessels of unrighteousness, they are the causes of samsara, not of righteous conduct.

**Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam**

**Aatur.** Ga. 47 And hearing this, the क्षपक ( क्षपक is a term for a person who is about to die) becomes engrossed in contemplation and sorrow, and thinks:

> "Many deaths of children have been experienced in the higher realms, the lower realms, and among the Tiryanchas (animals). I will embrace the death of a wise person, along with the knowledge and vision." (75)

**Explanation:**

* **Uddham:** Higher realms (heavenly realms).
* **Adho:** Lower realms (hellish realms).
* **Tiryancha:** Animals, beings with one to five senses.
* **Kadaani:** Experienced, obtained.
* **Bahugaani:** Many.
* **Darshananaanasah:** With knowledge and vision.
* **Gado:** Obtained, attained.
* **Pandiyarana:** Death of a wise person, death with pure conduct and character.
* **Anumarisse:** I will embrace, I will accept.

**Meaning:** The क्षपक is reflecting on the many deaths of children he has witnessed in various realms. He realizes that the death of a wise person, accompanied by knowledge and vision, is the path he should choose.

**Aatur.** Ga. 48 Remembering these deaths caused by anxiety and birth, and the suffering in hell, he decides to embrace the death of a wise person. He says:

> "I will embrace the death of a wise person, remembering the deaths caused by anxiety and birth, and the suffering in hell." (76)

**Explanation:**

* **Ubbeyamaranam:** Death caused by anxiety, death due to separation from loved ones or association with undesirable things.
* **Jaadimarana:** Death at birth, death of a fetus in the womb.
* **Niraesu:** In hell.
* **Vedanao y:** Suffering, pain.
* **Edaani:** These.
* **Sanbharanto:** Remembering.
* **Pandiyarana:** Death of a wise person.
* **Anumarisse:** I will embrace, I will accept.

**Meaning:** The क्षपक is reflecting on the suffering caused by anxiety, birth, and hell. He is determined to embrace the death of a wise person, as it offers a path to liberation from these cycles of suffering.

**Why is the death of a wise person the best among all deaths?**

> "One death of a wise person cuts through many hundreds of births. That death should be embraced, which leads to complete liberation." (77)

**Explanation:**

* **Ekkam:** One.
* **Pandiyarana:** Death of a wise person.
* **Chindadi:** Cuts through.
* **Jaadisayaani:** Hundreds of births.
* **Bahugaani:** Many.
* **Tam:** That.
* **Maranam:** Death, separation of the body and senses.
* **Maridavvam:** Should be embraced, should be accepted.
* **Jena:** By which.
* **Madam:** Dead.
* **Summadam:** Completely liberated.
* **Hodi:** Becomes.

**Meaning:** The क्षपक emphasizes that the death of a wise person is the most beneficial, as it cuts through the cycle of birth and death, leading to complete liberation. He urges the listener to embrace this path, as it is the only way to achieve true freedom from suffering.

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakiirnakam

The ocean is not filled by fourteen rivers. Just as fire cannot be satisfied by grass and wood, nor the salt ocean by thousands of rivers, so also the soul cannot be satisfied by sensual pleasures. 

**80.** Aatur. Ga. 52.  "What is the meaning of the statement that even a little desire leads to sin?"

Even for the sake of food, fish enter the seventh earth.  Food obtained with a disturbed mind is not suitable, even if desired by the mind.

**81.** Aahaaranimittam - because of food. Kir -  this is a definite statement, as it is said in the scriptures. Maccha - fish. Gachchanti - go, enter.  Sattami - seventh.  Pudhvi - earth, the realm of existence.  Sacchitto - with a disturbed mind,  unsuitable for killing living beings.  Aahaaro - food.  Na kappati - is not suitable.  Manasaavi - even by the mind, by mental activity.  Patthedu - to request, to ask.

Because of food, fish, rice, and other things definitely enter the seventh earth, therefore, even if desired by the mind, food obtained with a disturbed mind is not suitable.

**82.** Aatur. Ga. 53.  "Since food obtained with a disturbed mind is not suitable, therefore, one should strive for pure conduct."

First, having performed the previous karma, being free from desire, having strived with intellect and understanding, then, having purified the passions, be ready to accept death.

**83.** Puvva - previous, first.  Kadaparimmo - performed karma, the practice of austerities.  Anidaano - without desire for worldly or otherworldly happiness.  Eehiduuna - having strived, having made an effort.  Madibuuddhi - with intellect and understanding, possessing knowledge of both the seen and the unseen.  Paccha - afterwards.  Maliyakasaao - purified from passions, possessing forgiveness.  Sajjo - ready, devoted, having fulfilled one's duty.  Maranam - death, Samadhi, death by self-study.  Padicchaahi - accept, practice.

One goes to hell because of wrong conduct, therefore, having made a firm decision based on direct and indirect knowledge, having performed the previous karma, being free from desire, and having purified the passions, one should be ready to accept death.

Appendix-7: Comparison of Fundamental Principles

**Verse 351**

Even those who have been virtuous for a long time, at the time of death, due to the weight of their past karma, fall away from the Three Jewels.

**Verse 352**

Therefore, just as the moon is obscured by clouds, so too, the soul, due to its inherent qualities, must be made to strive for liberation.

**Verse 353**

How can one strive when, at that time, one is unable to perform external practices like breath control?

One who is free from external practices and has entered into the state of inner meditation, like a person who is not confused in that place, should abandon the body.

## Aaturpratyakhyanaprakirnakam

**At the time of renunciation.**  A person who is not deluded, who has no delusion about food and other things, should abandon the body. Even though he is devoid of external yoga, he has entered the internal yoga of meditation. In that place and time, he should abandon the body as he is free from delusion. || 86 ||

**352**
**Aatur. Ga. 57**

What would happen if one abandons the body without delusion?  Therefore, it is said:

By killing attachment and aversion, and cutting off the eight karmic chains, by breaking the birth-death cycle, you will be liberated. || 90 ||

**Hantuun** - killing. **Raagadose** - attachment and aversion, love and liking. **Chhettun ya** - cutting off. **Atthakamma sankhaliyam** - eight karmic chains. **Jammanamaranahattam** - birth-death cycle, the machine of birth and death. **Bhett** - breaking. **Bhavaihi** - from the worlds, or by the worlds. **Muccihisi** - you will be liberated, or you will be freed.  By killing attachment and aversion, cutting off the eight karmic chains, and breaking the birth-death cycle, you will be liberated from the worlds. || 90 ||

**Aatur. Ga. 58**  If so,

I believe in this entire teaching, the Jina's vision, with three-fold faith. It is the essence of the path to liberation, which brings welfare to both mobile and immobile beings. || 91 ||

**Savvamidam** - all this. **Uvadeesam** - teaching, scripture. **Jinadiṭṭhe** - the Jina's vision, or what is said by the Jina. **Saddhaami** - I have faith, I am interested in it. **Triviheṇa** - three-fold. **Tasathavarakhemakaraṁ** - those who tremble, those who are mobile, with two senses or up to five senses. **Sthaanaśīlaah** - immobile beings, those who are rooted, from earth-bodied beings to plants. Or, those who tremble due to the arising of the karma of trembling, and those who are immobile due to the arising of the karma of immobility.  It brings welfare, compassion, and happiness to them.  Therefore, it is the welfare of mobile and immobile beings, which is the teaching of compassion for all beings. **Saaram** - the essence, the main thing, the essence because of the cause. **Nivvaanamaggassa** - the path to liberation, the path to liberation.  With the right faith, knowledge, and conduct, the essence of the path to liberation is the welfare of mobile and immobile beings, and I have faith in this entire teaching, the Jina's vision, with three-fold faith. || 99 ||

Appendix-7: Comparison of Fundamental Practices in Verses:
353
Aatur. Ga. 59
At that time, just as faith in the twelve-limbed and fourteen-limbed scriptures is practiced, so too, is it possible to contemplate and study all the scriptures? It is said:
"It is not possible in that time and place to practice the twelve-limbed scriptures.
All should contemplate, with a strong and capable mind." ||12||
N- negation. Hi- because. Tamhi- in that. Desayale- time and place. "Dis ati sarjane" is seen as "disya te ati srjyo" meaning "desh" is the body and "kal" is the time, in that time of leaving the body. Sakko- possible. Barasaviho- twelve-limbed, twelve types. Sudakkhando- scripture-limb, meaning scripture-tree. Savvo- all, everything. Anuchinte- to contemplate, to understand the meaning, to read. Balinavi- even with strong physical strength. Samatthacitte- with a capable mind, with a one-pointed mind, with a monk. In that time and place, even with strong physical strength and a capable mind, it is not possible to contemplate the twelve-limbed scriptures. ||12||
Aatur. Ga. 60
Therefore, what should be done?
"In one word, there is enthusiasm on the path of non-attachment.
A person goes to that, and that should not be abandoned at the time of death." ||13||
Ekkasi- in one. Bidhiyahi- two fulfillments, the second is "namah siddhebyah". Sanveo- enthusiasm, joy in dharma.  Pade- in the meaning of the word, in the scripture, in the proof, or in the five prostrations. Or, Ekkamhi bijamhi pade- in one seed-word, meaning "in which". Viyaragamaggammi- on the path of non-attachment, in the teachings of the omniscient. Vaccadi- goes, walks, proceeds. Naro- by a person, one who has abandoned all attachments. Abhikham- constantly, without interruption. Tam- that. Maranante- at the time of death, when the breath is in the throat, or at the very end. Na mottavvam- should not be abandoned, should not be left. In one word, in the second word, or in the five prostrations, on the path of non-attachment, in which there is constant enthusiasm, that word should not be abandoned at the time of death by a person; or, a person goes to that word in which there is enthusiasm, that word should not be abandoned by him, this is the connection.

**Aaturpraatyaakhyaana Prakirnakam**

**Aatur** 61: Why should this not be given up? Because even a single verse from the Shruta Skandha or the Panchanamaskara, contemplated upon at the time of death, makes one who is devoted to the right faith, knowledge, conduct, and austerities, a devotee. 

**Aatur** 62: What is the fruit of devotion? To this, it is said: One who is devoted to the right faith, knowledge, etc., and who has made time for it, and has performed it well, attains the three excellences and then attains Nirvana.

**Aatur** 63: Having heard the Acharya's consolation and knowing the scriptures, the patient, desiring to bring about a result based on cause, said: "I have a feeling that the Shramanas are equal to me, and that I am equal to all who are restrained in all ways. I give up everything, and this is what I have said in brief."

Appendix-7: Comparison of Fundamental Principles

**Verse 355**
**Verse 355**  Atura. Ga. 64  Further shows the firm result
*Laddham aladdhapuvvaṁ jiṇavaṇaṁ subhāsiṁda amida bhūdaṁ.*
*Gahiṁdo suggamiggo ṇāhaṁ maraṇassa bīhemi.* ||19||
*Laddham* - obtained. *Aladdhapuvvaṁ* - not obtained before. *Jiṇavaṇaṁ* - the words of the Jina. *Subhāsiṁda* - well-spoken, not contradictory to the scriptures. *Amida bhūdaṁ* - like nectar, because it is the cause of happiness. *Gahiṁdo* - taken. *Suggamiggo* - the path of good fortune. *ṇāhaṁ maraṇassa bīhemi* - I do not fear death.
I have obtained the words of the Jina, which are well-spoken and like nectar, and I have taken the path of good fortune. Therefore, I do not fear death. ||99||

**Verse 355**  Atura. Ga. 65  Therefore
*Dhīreṇa vi mariḍavvaṁ ṇiddhiireṇa vi avassa mariḍavvaṁ.*
*Jdi dohiṁ vi mariḍavvaṁ varaṁ hi dhīrattaṇeṇa mariḍavvaṁ.* ||100||
*Dhīreṇa vi* - even with patience, even with fortitude. *Mariḍavvaṁ* - to die, to give up life. *ṇiddhiireṇa vi* - even with impatience, even with fear. *Avassa* - certainly. *Mariḍavvaṁ* - to die. *Jdi dohiṁ vi* - if even by both. *Mariḍavvaṁ* - to die, to go to another life, because there is no difference. *Varaṁ* - better. *Hi* - certainly. *Dhīrattaṇeṇa* - with patience, with freedom from distress. *Mariḍavvaṁ* - to die.
If death is certain, even with patience and impatience, then death with patience is better, because there is no difference. ||100||

**Verse 355**  Atura. Ga. 66  If one who is suffering from hunger, etc., has any special benefit in the destruction of conduct, then how much more so in the case of immortality?
*Sīleṇa vi mariḍavvaṁ ṇissīleṇa vi avassa mariḍavvaṁ.*
*Jah dohiṁ vi mariḍavvaṁ varaṁ hu sīlattaṇeṇa mariḍavvaṁ.* ||101||
If death is certain, even with conduct and without conduct, then death with conduct is better. The protection of vows is conduct. If death is certain, even with good conduct and bad conduct, then death with good conduct is better. ||101||

**Aaturpratyakhyanprakirnakam**

**Aatur:** (Verse 68) What is the rule here?

**[Response]:**

* **Chirausidabhambhayari papphodedoon sesayam kammam.**
* **Anupuveey visuddho suddo siddim gardi jaadi.** (102)

**Explanation:**

* **Chirausid:** One who has lived for a long time.
* **Bhambhayari:** One who practices celibacy, or one who practices Brahma (the ultimate reality).
* **Papphodedoon:** By rejecting, by discarding.
* **Sesayam kamma:** The remaining karma, such as knowledge-obscuring karma.
* **Anupuveey:** By gradual progression, or by the decline of lifespan and the progression of virtue-stages.
* **Visuddho:** Purified, free from karmic stains.
* **Suddo:** Pure, possessing perfect knowledge and other virtues.
* **Siddim gardi jaadi:** Attains liberation, reaches the state of liberation.

**Meaning:**

A celibate who has lived for a long time, by discarding the remaining karma and by purifying himself through the gradual progression of virtue-stages, becomes pure and attains liberation. Alternatively, by the continuous progression of the effects of his actions, he becomes pure, attains perfect knowledge, and reaches the highest state. (102)

**Aatur:** (Verse 69) Why is this so?

**[Response]:**

* **Nikkasayasssa dantasssa surasss vavasaaino.**
* **Samsarabhaybheedass pacchakkhanam suham have.** (104)

**Explanation:**

* **Nikkasayasssa:** One who is free from passions.
* **Dantasssa:** One who has controlled his senses.
* **Surassa:** One who is courageous, fearless.
* **Vavasaaino:** One who is dedicated, committed to his practice.
* **Samsarabhaybheedass:** One who is afraid of the cycle of birth and death.
* **Pacchakkhanam:** Renunciation, worship.
* **Suham:** Happiness, the cause of happiness.
* **Have:** Will be.

**Meaning:**

For one who is free from passions, has controlled his senses, is courageous, dedicated, and afraid of the cycle of birth and death, renunciation is the cause of happiness. Therefore, such a person, when dying, will be a worshiper. (104)
