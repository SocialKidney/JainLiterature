PREFACE
The Ayaro (Skt. ACARANGA SUTRA) begins with the quest for the soul. Even as the starting point of the philosophy of Vedanta is the Sutra: athato brahma-jijnasa "Now begins the quest for the Supreme Reality (Brahma)", the starting point of Jain Philosophy is athato atma-jijnasa "Now begins the quest for the soul.
11
 2010_03
i
Meaning of Acara: That the soul exists, that it is eternal as well as ephemeral, that it itself is the doer of actions as well as the enjoyer of their fruits, that there is "bondage" and there are causes of it; that there is "liberation" and there are means to attain it these are the basic principles on which_rests the edifice of the Jain Ethics or acara. As the Acaranga elucidates all these, it may be spoken of as a treatise on acara or spiritual conduct.
-
According to Jain philosophy, neither mere knowledge of philosophy nor mere practice of moral conduct can help one to attain liberation. It is the proper synthesis of both - knowledge and conduct-that leads to the final emancipation2, It is, therefore, not possible to keep these two in watertight compartments. The present canonical text, however, mainly deals with the acara, and hence it may be spoken of as the "Book of acaru".
The term acara, as it was used by Bhagavan Mahavira, does not connote mere moral conduct, but it was used in a wider sense. According to him, acara is of five kinds, viz., knowledge, faith, self-discipline, austerities and spiritual exertion. Thus it is clear that acara includes all the threeknowledge, faith as well as self-discipline (or spiritual conduct), which are the right means of achieving liberation. 1. Brahma-Sutra 1/1.

ii
As the Acaranga Sutra describes the means of achieving liberation, it has been called the essence of the entire Jain Instruction3.
Samatva which stands for the practice of both "Equanimity" and Equality" forms the basis of the science of ethics prescribed by Bhagwan Mahavira. That is why, the Acaranga Sutra states that one who perceives "equality" in all living beings and observes "equanimity" in all sorts of various opposite situations created by gain and loss, pleasure and pain, living and dying, applause and condemnation, and honour and insult, would never indulge in any action which is against the ethical code: sammatta-damsi na karei pava na.
Performance and Renunciation of Karma: The karma.yoga i. e. disciplined performance of action and the karmasammyasa i. e., renunciation of action have been the subject of debate for thousand of years in Indian systems of religion, all of which have enjoined the renunciation and performance of karma in a smaller or greater degree. When the Bhagavad-Gita 5 sings: "na hi de habhrta sakyam tyaktum karmanyasesatah", "No living organism bound in bodily existence can renounce karma completely", it strikes the right note. In light of the fact that the body and activity are inseparable, we can speak of the renunciation of karma only in a very limited sense. How then can renunciation be defined? Various criteria of renunciation have been laid down to answer this question. For instance, the Ayaro draws a line of demarcation between the spiritually disciplined and indisciplined actions, and defines renunciation as relinquishment of the latter6. And the Gita explains renunciation in terms of giving up of attachment to actions and desire for their fruits.

iii
One may see verbal difference in the above definitions. but it would not be right to infer that they differ in meaning. For performance of actions infused with attachment and desire for the fruit amounts to spiritually indisciplined actions. Thus both the Ayaro and the Gita' extol the same ideal of renunciation. Yet it is strange that two different traditions have evolved from the philosophies of the two sacred texts. The tradition based on the Gita lays emphasis on idea of performing actions, but does not seem to give weight to the idea of giving up attachment and desire for gaining fruits of actions. On the other hand, the tradition that emerged on the basis of the Ayaro seems to have given stress on mere renunciation of actions but failed to give proper weight to the idea of renunciation of attachment, aversion and desire. Thus both the traditions had originally accepted the same ideal, but in course of time they began to proceed in different directions, and the verbal differences made them appear different.
Bhagavan Mahavira, however, never insisted on the renunciation of all actions in the very first step of Sadhana. For the beginners he emphasised the need for purifying actions. The Ayaracula 8 (i.e. the appendix to the Ayaro) explains Bhagawan Mahavira's position in the following words:
7. Gita, 18/9:
Karyamityeva yatkarma, niyatam kriyaterjuna!
Sargam tyaktva phalam caiva, sa tyagah sattviko matah. 8. Ayaracula, 15/72-76 :
na sakka na soum sadda, soyavisayamagata, ragadosa u je tattha, te bhikkhu parivajjae. no sakka ruvamadatthum, cakkhuvisayamagayam, ragadosa u je tattha, te bhikkhu parivajjae. no sakka na gamdhamagghaum, nasavisayamagayan, ragadosa u je tattha, te bhikkhu parivajjae. no sakka na rasamanasaum, jihavisayamagayam, ragadosa u je tattha, te bhikhu parivajjae. no sakk, na samvedeum, phasavisayamagayam, ragadosa u je tattha, te bhikkhu parivajjae.

"It is impossible not to hear words within the reach of the sense of hearing, but it is possible not to be attached or averse to them. An ascetic should not, therefore, be a victim of attachment and aversion to the objects of the sense of hearing. Similarly, it is impossible not to smell, taste, see and touch objects within the reach of the sense-organs of smell, taste, sight and touch, but it is possible to give up attachment and aversion to them. The ascetic should not, therefore, become a victim of attachment and aversion.
Ascetic conduct (acara) consists in doing actions unmotivated by attacnment and aversion. According to the Aca - ranga, that man is deemed to be the possessor of right knowledge whose actions are not sullied with attachment or aversion, Bhagavan Mahavira has expounded several forms of such conduct. The foremost among them is ahimsa or non-violence. The first chapter of the Acaranga deals with this theme at length. The ensuing chapters give directions in regard to the cultivation of feelings of non-violence, nonpossessiveness, celibacy, non-attachment, truth,etc. This code of conduct may in fact be spoken of as the 'code of equanimity'.
Lord Mahavira was the propounder of the philosophy of equanimity. He showed how human life could be transformed in the light of this doctrine. He did not forcibly impose any discipline on his followers, but allowed them the freedom of choice. He said, "One who sees things needs no instruction."10 "One who has the right vision begins to see the world and himself in a different light! l'Annaha nam pasae par iharejja".")

INTRODUCTION
1. The first srutaskandha of the Ayaro represents an early phase of the ascetic ideology, and the language and metres of the work are directly derived from the Vedic idiom. The terminology used in the text is related to an earlier state of Nirgranthism and is at the same time the harbinger of its later development as a system of morality and religion with its own definite disciplinary code. The text opens with a passage which embodies the perennial concern of philosophers, doubts that embarrass their minds. The cosmic doubt of the Vedic seer - kuta ajata kuta iyam visy stih (from whence did it sprint forth, from whence did this creation emanate?) - finds its counterpart in the Ayaro's query about the self- ke aham asi, ke va cute pecca bhavissami 2 (what was I, what shall I be in the next birth after departure from here?) which is reminiscent of a heresy recorded in the Majjhima Nikaya3 - ajam nu kho satto kuto agato, so kuhimgami bhavissati (vhei efrom indeed this being come, where shall he go?). Mortification of the flesh for the regeneration of the spirit is the quintessence of the philosophy of the Ayaro which is replete with exhortations to the spiritual aspirant to subjugate the passions through infinite endurance of hardships and relinquishment of wordly interests, "Stoutly tolerating the (unpleasant) sound and touch and subduing the lust for life, the saint, true to his saintliness, mortifies his body born of past karma; he subsists on the stale and insipid (food), being courageous and equanimous; he is indeed the saint, who has crossed the flood and is rightly designated as one 'who has crossed', 'who is emancipated', 'who has withdrawn himself' - thus do I say'4. In fact, the biography of Mahavira in the Ayaro, chapter LX, which undoubtedly is 1 Rgveda, x, 129.6. 2. I, 1, 1.2. 3. I, p.12 (NNMEdn). 4. Ayaro, I, 2. 6.161-5:

the oldest and at the same time absolutely free from my thology, is an illustration of the extreme type of asceticism adumbrated in the text. We shall see in what follows the religio-moral spirit that characterized the age of Mahavira and has found vent through the pithy sayings and pregnant expressions which are so abundant in the work under review.
2. Now to come to the pithy sayings, they cover a large number of themes, namely, rejection of violence or nonviolence, bondage and emancipation, fearlessness, friendship, attachment to life, atman in its empirical and transcendental aspects, mysticism, renunciation, asceticism, clusters of essentially connected concepts, prophetic injunctions (prajnapana), and such other subjects which offer copious insight into the moral and spiritual background of Mahavira's teachings,
(i) Non-violence: The man of violence (damda) is indeed he who is unmindful and addicted to wordly pleasures5. Above, below, and in front, people indulge in 'violent activities against living beings individually and collectively in many ways; discerning this, a wise man neither himself inflicts violence on these bodies, nor induces others to do so, nor approves of their doing so. The unwise are sleeping, the wise are awake; know that pain is the cause of evil in the world; knowing the welfare of the world, one should eschew weapons of violence'.

(ii) Bondage and Emancipation: Bondage and emancipation are within yourself - bamdha-pamokkho tujjha ajjhattheva 8. Blinded and immersed in worldly pleasures, the fool with bondage unsevered and attachment not cut off, dwells in darkness, being ignorant, and is never able to get at the command9. Attached to things sensual, they bewail bitterly, and on account of desires, fail to get at emancipation10. Man! restrain thyself, and thus thou shalt be emancipated from suffering11.
(iii) Fearlessness: The unmindful is beset with fear on all sides; for the mindful, there is no fear from any side12.
(iv) Friendship: Man! thou art thy own friend, why wishest thou for a friend beyond thyself13.
(v) Attachment to Life: All beings are fond of life, they like pleasure, dislike pain, disfavour injury, wish for long life, long for survival; life is dear to all14.
(vi) Atman in its Empirical and Transcendental Aspects There are beings who are blind, sunk in darkness; they experience ups and downs, indulging in an activity (anew) for the first time, or repeating it many times15. Having con

tained the stream, leaving the world, the great (soul) becomes free from karma and knows and perceives (the truth) and does not desire (anything), being introspective; having comprehended the coming and going, he crosses the path of birth and death, being established in perfection (viz. the state of emancipation)16. For the seer, there is no need of instruction17. Of one who is free from kar ma there exists no description. It is kar ma that gives rise to (the necessity of) imposition (of characteristics)18.
(vii) Mysticism: The wise is neither bound nor liberated19. The atman is the knower, and the knower is the atman: that by which one knows is the atman20. The liberated state is not expressible through language; nor is it amenable to reasoning; intellect does not penetrate there; the passionless (at man) is conversant with the nature of 'what is without support' (viz. emancipation); he is neither long nor small...... neither feminine nor masculine nor otherwise (neuter)...... there is no analogy; it is formless existence; there is no condition of the unconditioned 21.

22. practises deceitlessness' Emancipated indeed are those who are gone to the other shore; conquering greed through non-greed, he does not addict to pleasures that might offer themselves; being free from greed, he renounces the world; ceasing to act, he knows and perceives (the truth); he has no desires because of his insight; he is rightly called 'houseless 23
(ix) Asceticism: The sixth chapter called Dhuya -Ajjhayana contains material which is definitely the precursor of the dhutanga of early Buddhism. Dhuta stands for austerities which wash away the passions. The sage who is well versed in the dhamma and firm in the discipline of austerity (vidhutakappe) is always the destroyer of the effects of karma; to a monk who has given up the garment, it does never occur: my clothes are torn, I shall beg for new ones... such unclothed monk, while thus exerting himself in the discipline, is often exposed to the (harsh) touch of grassblades, of cold, heat, gnats and mosquitoes; he endures such other various hardships, remaining unclothed in order to move light; he is well established in penance as propounded by the Exalted One; realising this in full and in all respects, he should rightly comprehend equanimity 24. Of the enlightened ones the arms are emaciated and flesh and blood are reduced to the utmost25. "Look at (the state of)

attachment; men are bound by fetters, sunk in spirit and overpowered by lust; be not, therefore, afraid of hardship. He who is perfectly and completely enlightened about the acts of violence and from whom even his robbers do not fear harm, is indeed one who has shaken off anger, pride, deceit and greed; he is indeed worthy being called 'the metamorphosed one' - thus I say. Such person, on account of his renunciation of the body, is considered as standing lin the forefront of the battle'. He is indeed the sage who has reached the other side. Even on being killed, he stands still like a beam approached by death, courting death as the dissolution of the body - thus I say"26. This discipline unto death finds its consummation in the eighth chapter called the Vimoha -Ajjhayana (chapter on liberation).
(x) The Clusters of Essentially Connected Concepts: Our text contains clusters of words connoting similar concepts which throw a flood of light on the evolution of those concepts the history of their origin and the later course of their development. Thus, for instance, the cluster ayavadi, logavadi, kammavadi, kiriyavadi (respectively, believers in soul, world, karma, action)27 represents the early stage of the doctrine of soul and rebirth in Indian philosophy. Similarly, the bunchpana breathing), bhuta (existing), jiva (living), satta (sentient-creature)28 - indicates the divergent conceptions of the principle of soul in our ancient thought. On the other hand, the group-gamtha (bondage), moha (delusion), mara (death), niraya (hell)29

stands for the cause as well as the state of worldly life in the earlier phase of the ancient religions of our country. In 1. 2. 4.92, the terms dukkha (suffering) and naraga-tir ikkha (hell-animal) are found added. The cluster- atavam, nanavam, veyavam, dhammavam, bambhavam (respectively, established in atman, knowledge, Vedas, dhar ma, Brahmana)30 refers to the state of interaction of the Brahmana and Sramana cultures, which gave rise to an integrated Indian culture in later times. The highest achievements of the spiritual aspirant are grouped together in the bunch - samti (peace), virati (abstinence), uvasama (calmness), nivvana (liberation), soyaviya (purity), ajjaviya (uprightness), maddaviya (modesty), laghaviya (lightness), anati - vattiya (non-transgression)31. The cluster - hiyam (good), Suham (blissful), khemam (wholesome), nissesam (complete), anugamiyam (favourable)32 represents the different aspects of the ancient concept of the highest good, the summum bonum of the spiritual disciplines. The firm conviction about a particular doctrine was expressed by any of these words - ditthi (view), mutti (faith, Cf. Pali adhimutti), purakkara (dominant idea), sanna. (notion), nivesana (persuasion)33.
(xi) Prophetic Injections (Pannavana): Our text contains a few excerpts which are given as universal injuncttions of the Exalted Ones, past, present, and future. These passages are definitely of very great antiquity, if not the words of the Nayaputta himself. One such excerpt is given at the very outset of Chapter IV, called Sammatta-Ajj hayana. It runs as follows: Thus do I say the Arahamtas (the Revered Ones) and the Bhagavamtas (the Lords) of the past, present and future, all say thus, speak thus, enjoin thus (evam pannava mte), explain thus - all breathing, all existing, all living, all sentient creatures should not be killed, nor treated with violence, nor abused, nor tormented, nor driven away. This is the discipline which is pure, eternal, inalterable, and declared by the enlightened ones who have

comprehended (the nature of) the world34. Non-violence is always the theme of these injunctions.
3. Our text provides a vivid picture of the ascetic life that dominated the society of the days of Mahavira and Buddha. Some of the expressions used in the text are, in fact, the prototypes of what we find enunciated in the systematic works of early Jainism and Buddhism. The moral and monastic discipline of the Jainas which was codified in later times are discernible here in a rudimentary form couched in expressions which are pregnant with principles that served as a bridge between the ascetic codes of the pre- and post-Mahavira periods. Even the five Maharatas (great vows) which have the universal sanction of all schools of Indian philosophers are here only in the process of evolution. There are also ideas and concepts that gave way to their nearby counterparts which gained currency in the changed set-up. We shall here study a number of such amorphous expressions to see how they contributed to the evolution of concepts which later on became static and solid in their connotation.
(i) The Five Mahavratas (Great Vows): Of the five maha - vratas of later days, the first, viz. ahimsa , has found place in our text in numerous contexts, and is indeed the persistent theme dominating over all other principles that constituted the moral life of those times. All types of himsa perpetrated on all kinds of beings, beginning from the onesensed organisms up to the fully developed five-sensed beings, are condemned. The words damda (panel instrument) and sattha (weapon of violence) are repeatedly used to denote violence. A person who is careless (pamatte) in his conduct and is engrossed in sensual pleasures (gunatthite) is called damda (panel instrument)35. All suffering is due
34. ibid. I, 4.1.1:

to himsa qua arambha (violent action)36. The word sacca (truth) which is the designation of the second mahavrata is used with a special connotation in our text. Sacca stands for the word of the Enlightened One, that is, the discipline propounded by Him37, and not simply 'desisting from falsehood'. The third traditional mahavrata , viz. (desisting from) adinnadana (unauthorized appropriation) is mentioned immediately after (desisting from) sattha (weapon of violence)38. This second position occupied by the traditionally third mahavrata tallies with the Buddhist custom of placing it at the second place in the list of silas. As regards the traditional mahavrata of brahmacarya (celibacy), our text usually mentions it as 'vasitta bambhacer - amsi' (practising monkhood, literally 'living in chastily')39. It is also used singly on one occasion40. The use of the expression 'bambhavam' as synonymous with 'dhammavam! also points to a wider connotation of the word 'bhambhacerai41. The mahavrata of apar igraha (non-possession of property) is stated through the phrase 'pariggaha m ama ma - yamane! (not attached to the possessions 42, which does not formulate the vow in the fashion of its traditional definition. The indefinite nature of this vow in the Buddhist tradition confirms the position of our text in the matter. This review of the state of mahavratas in the first Srutas - kandha of the Ayaro clearly demonstrates the uncrystallized forms of the great vows in those days. A passage of the Ayaro deserves our consideration in this connection. It mentions a discipline of three jamas 43, which, if explained in the context of satras 1. 8.1.3-5, might stand for

the great vows of pana ivayao veramanam (desisting from killing), adinnadanao ver amanam (desisting from theft) and musavayao veramanam (desisting from false speech), the meaning of musavaya. being analogous to that given in the Tattavarthabhasya, VII. 9, which appears to be a faithful record of the original content of the vow. These sutras run as follows:
(3) ihamegesim ayaragoyare no sunisamte bhavati, te iha arambhatthi anuvayamana hana mana, ghayamana, hanato yavi samanujanamana; (4) aduva adinyama iyamti; (5) aduva vayao viumjamti, tam jaha - atthi loe, natthi loe, dhuve loe, adhuve loe.... That is "(3) Some people are not well instructed as regards the subject of conduct; they are desirous of actions, repeat them in words, they kill (creatures), make others kill and approve of (such acts); (4) or, they take what has not been given to them; (5) or, they pronounce divergent opinions, viz., 'the world exists', 'the world does not exist', the world is eternal', 'the world is non-eternal', and so on." Here the content of the sutra no.5 may be interpreted as standing for musavaya (false speech) of later times, and we have the Tattvarthabhasya, VII. 9, which explains the vow in a similar fashion, to endorse such interpretation. The traditional great vows as reflected in our text are thus the precursors of the classical codification of the subject in the other Agamas and the treatises. The word 'vrata' (vow) is also conspicuous by its absence in our text.
(ii) The Marga (path): The classical definition of the moksa-marga (path of emancipation) is consisting in samyag-darsana (right view), samyag -jnana (right knowledge) and samyak-car itra (right conduct) is absent. A very simple, though immensely poignant,, description of the path of emancipation has found vent in the statement: se kitfati tesim samutthitanamnikkhittadamdanam samahitanamn pannanamamtanam iha muttimaggam (He, the Exalted One, here propounds the path of emancipation to those who are exerting their spiritual vigour, have given up weapons of violence, are practising meditation, and are full of penetrating wisdom)44. The spiritual vigour, mentioned here, stands for 44. ibid. I, 6.1.3.

virya (energy) which is the sine qua non of all spiritual activity, rejection of violence is the epitome of the silas, and the elements of samadhi (meditation) and prajna (pene-trating wisdom) are clearly mentioned in the statement. Sila, samadhi and prajna, which are traditionally known as constituting the Buddhist path of emancipation, are thus succinct in the above description. As regards the samyagdarsana of Jainism, it is expressed by the term damsana in the following passage: se vamta koham ca manam ca mayam ca lobham ca; etam passagassa damsanam uvaratasatthassa paliyamtakarassa ayanam sagadabbhi (he conquers anger, pride, deceit, and greed; this is the view of the seer who desists from weapons of violence, has put an end to the sources (of samsara), being the destroyer of his karmas)45. In another passage46 the items of pejja (lust). dosa (hatred), moha (delusion), gabbha (wamb), jamma (birth), mara (death), naraga (hell), tiriya (animal) and dukkha (suffering) are to be conquered for attaining the right view. On yet another occasion47 this damsana (view) is identified with ditthi (view),mutti (faith), etc., which leaves no doubt that the concept is the forerunner of the samyag-darsana or samyag-drsti in the system of Jaina ethics. As for the samyag-jnana. the expression pannana (Skt. Prajnaman, mentioned above, is the prototype which is represented by the Pali word 'panna'. As regards samyak-caritra, the statements-ahege dhammamadaja ayanappabhiim supan - ihie care apaliyamane dadhe savvam gehim parinnaya (having embraced the dhamma one should practise it from the very beginning with extreme precaution and firmness, not succumbing (to wordly things), fully abandoning all lust48, vaigutte ajjhappasamvude parivajjae sada pavam (being reserved in his speech and guarding his mind, he should always avoid sin)49, and the like contain the rudiments of the system of moral conduct formulated later on. The concept of marga (path) thus is represented in our text through a terminology which is most popular in character and far away from the later crystallization in the systematic treatises dealing with the topic.

(iii) Asava: The expression asava is used in the sense of hardship to be borne by an ascetic."Even if the creatures injure the body, he should not move from the place;he should endure (with patience), being afflicted with different types of asavas (hardships)"50. This is also exactly the meaning of the Pali word 'as aval in the phrase- adhivasana pahatabba asava' (the hardships which are to be got rid of through endurance)51. The word is used in this very sense in the phrase je asava te parissava, je parissava te asava (what is hardship is privation, what is privation is hardship)52. The meaning of the word paris sava in this phrase is analogous to that of the Pali word parissaya which stands for the privation of hunger, heat, cold, insect-bites, and so on 53. This reminds us of the parisahas in the second chapter of the Uttarajjhayana. The expression asava gradually underwent a great semantic change in the ethical system of the Jainas.
(iv) Nivvana, Parinivvana, Pamokkha: We have already given the synonyms of nivvana in 2 (X) which unequivocally indicate a state of spiritual peace and tranquillity and pliability of body and mind. The expression yivvuda or nivvuta which are past participles of nivvana stands for a person who desists from sinful activities and is free from all desires54. The expression bar in ivvana however is to denote freedom from fear and suffering55, the past participle' parinivvuaa' standing for the state of being a source of fearlessness and freedom from attachment and animosity56, the expression pamokkha refers to deliverance from suffering dukkha pamokkhasi 57 or death (marana

pamuccati)58. Nivvana and its equivalents thus primarily stand for emancipation from suffering, and not for any positive condition of unimpeded bliss as the later thinkers try to interpret them.
(v) Sardhi: The word appears as standing for the 'juncture' of birth and death, and is perhaps the precursor of the concept of pratisamdhi (rebirth). The expression ruvasamdhi (material juncture, or the meeting point of matter and spirit) in the following passage clinches the issue: "'Those who are not addicted to sinful activities might be liable to calamities, but the steadfast will bear them. As in the past so in the future, the body is (always) subject to change and destruction, unstable, transient, non-eternal, fattening and defattening, and of a changeable nature; erceive this material juncture (ruvasamdhi). For him who looks at things rightly, is devoted to one purpose, is disentangled and detached, there is no passage (from birth to birth)"59. One who has searched out the (proper) moment Ikhana) of the body has identified the juncture (samdhi)60. The phrases macciehim samdhim (juncture with the mortal onesol, logassa samdhim (juncture of the world)62, and samdhi jhosito (the juncture destroyed)63 confirm our conjecture about the connotation of the expression 'sa madhi' The expressions 'samgal and samjoga' are also used in similar sense. Thus we have lavattasoe samgamabhijanati (he knows the connection in the current of the whirl)64. Tete soya viyakkhata jehim samgam ti pasaha (these have been declared to be the currents, look at the connection

with them)65. As for the use of sarnjoga, we find passage like 'esa vire pasamsie acceti logasamjogam, esa nde pavuccati' (he is extolled as a hero, he transcends the connection with the world, he is called the leader (to the right path) 66 The most significant use of the word is found in the following excerpt which gives a total view of the spiritual path from beginning to end: dukkham logassa janitta, vamta logassa samjogan, jamti vira mahajanam, parena param jamti, navakamkhamti jivitamby. That is, knowing the suffering of the world, rejecting the connection (samjoga) with the world, the heroes go on the great path, they rise higher and higher and do not hanker after life. Here the four factors viz. (1) suffering, (2) the cause of suffering (viz. samjoga), (3) the path, and (4) the release from hankering which is the cause of suffering are succinctly stated. In other words, we here find the rudiments of the four arya -satyas (noble truths) of the Buddhists, viz. dukkha (suffering), samudaya (cause of suffering), nirodha (release from suffering) and marga (the path leading to the release).
(vi) Sarvajnata (Omniscience): There is no reference to the subject in our text. On only one occasion, however, it is said "one who knows the one knows all savvam janail and one who knows all knows the one; there is fear for the careless from all quarters, and there is no fear for the careful from any quarter; one who controls the one controls the many, and one who controls the many controls the one"68. The context here is the subjugation of anger, pride, deceit and greed and the insight of the seer (pasagassa darpsanam). It should therefore be plausible that the knowledge in question refers to the comprehension of the nature and subjuga

tion of any of these passions and the consequent conquest of the remaining ones. An insight into the nature of any one of these passions is followed by an insight into the nature of the rest, or conversely the insight into the nature of all these is virtually an insight into the nature of any of them. The concept of traditional omniscience cannot be read into the above statement by any stretch of imagination.
(vii) Pannana (Perception, Insight): This expression played a very important role in the Jaina as well as buddhist soteriology, as also epistemology. The Buddhist Pali equivalent of this word is panna (Skt. prajna). The expression pannana has an epistemological sense in the compounds sotapannana (auditory perception), cakkhupannana (ocular perception), ghanapannana (olfactory perception), rasapannana (gustatory perception), phasapannana (tactile perception)69. This is comparable to the Abhidharma conception of prajna, which is common to all states of consciousnes870. The other use of the term pannana in Jainism is in the sense of spiritual insight. Thus the compound savva-samannagatapannanall means 'insight into the nature of all things'. Similarly, the phrase mahavirehim pannanamamtehim pamana inupalabbha72, stands for'having obtained insight from the great heroes who are possessed of the insight'. This meaning of pannana is in essential conformity with that of the expression prajna in Buddhism, which is the consummation of the practice of sila (right conduct) and samadhi (meditation). The expression pannana thus as used in our text is pregnant with the future role that it was destined to play in Indian thought, specially Buddhism.
(viii) Jnana (Knowledge) and Darsana (Perception): The phrase janati pasati 3 is used to denote two separate aspects of knowledge, the verb 'janati' standing for knowing through various means, and pasati for knowing directly through perception or intuition. Thus in the description sejjam puna janejja saha sammuiyae paravagaranenam 69. ibid. I. 2.1.4 & 1.2.1. 25. 70. Abhidharma-kosa-Bhisya, 11. 24. 71.

annesim va, amtie socca'4, the act of knowing is stated to be done through consensus of opinion, or interpretation made by others, or hearing from others. The verb pasati, 75 on the other hand, in the phrase pasamane ruvaim pasati like suneti in sunamane saddaim suneti denotes simply the act of seeing with eyes, exactly as suneti denotes simply the act of hearing with ears. The word pasati is also used, as in the statement amto amto putide hamtarani pasati pudho vi savamtaim ,76 (in the interior of the body he perceives the foul interior humours and their several streams), figuratively to denote acuteness of intelligence. The derivative pasaga in the usages- uddeso pasagassa natthi77, etam pasagassa damsanam78, kimatthi uvadhi pasagassa? 79, is used to denote a person of deep insight'. Similarly the derivative nani (from janati) in nissaram pasiya nani80, stands for a 'wise person' (the expression pasiya meaning 'having observed'). It is thus found that the verbs janati and pasati or their derivatives were used in various ways to denote the different aspect of the act of knowing or intuition sometimes accentuating the distinction, and on other occasions obliterating it beyond recognition. In the phrase nissaram pasiya nani, just quoted, the acts of jnana and darsana are simultaneous, the latter being a part of the former. The distinction between the derivatives pasaga and nani is almost nil, as both imply the penetrating insight of the seer or the knower, irrespective of the linguistic aspects of the term. The sharp line of demarcation between jnana and darsana drawn in traditional Jaina philosophy is absent in our text and the controversies that emerged among the stalwart supporters of the different theories on the relationship between the two concepts should have found an aetiological solution from the usages of the
terms in our text.

assigned to jhana (Skt. dhyana) in the life of an ascetic. His austerities flowed from his jnana. He mediated day and night, self-restrained, mindful and concentrated (raimdivampi jhaya mane appa mutte samahite jhati) 1. He medicated internally fixing his eyes on the horizontal plane of the length of a man (adu porisim tiriyabhittim cakkhuma - sajja antaso jhati)82. "'That great hero, free from all distractions (akukkue) and seated (in a suitable posture) meditated-looking above, below and in front in concentration, without guile (apad inne). Free from passions (akasayi), devoid of greed (vigatagehi), and not attached to sounds and colours, he meditated."83 The conditions of meditation, as succinctly given here, are comparable to those given in early Buddhist scripture. Although it is not possible to have a full picture of the course of meditation followed by the Nayaputta, the strands that we are able to gather from stray references make it appear plausible that it was not essentially different from the one practised and preached by Gautama Buddha. There is passage in our text which gives a somewhat vivid idea of what a meditator should do for gaining an insight into the nature of things. "With his (mental) eye wide open, and with a penetrating insight into (the nature of) the world (logav ipassi) be knows the lower part, the upper part, as well as the horizontal region, with infatuated creatures circling round. He knows the juncture of the world. The hero who unfetters the fettered ones deserves praise. As is the interior (world of passions) so is the exterior (world circling round), and as is the exterior, so is the interior. In the interior of the body he perceives the foul interior humours and their several streams. The wise man, observing this and intelligently understanding the same, should not eat (his saliva). He should not throw himself flat on those things, "184 This is, obviously a prac

tice which is the precursor of the kayanupassana satipatthana (mindfulness concerning inspection of the interior of the body). An important aspect of this meditation is represented by the gerunds pehae (having looked at)85 and sapehae (having comprehended), which indicate the necessity of right cognitive attitude towards the world. This brief account of meditation, read with the eighth chapter called Vimoha-Ajjhayajawhich prescribes immobility of the body at the highest stage, gives an idea of the earliest form of meditation prevalent in the early periods of Nirgranthism and Buddhism.
4. The above account of the contents of the earliest book of the Ardha magadhi scripture of the Jainas is given, as far as possible, on the basis of the text itself, as edited by Muni Shri Nathmalji, without any reference to the exegetical literature. This study may be considered supplementary to what has been done by the learned editor who has brought to bear his vast knowledge in discntangling many a problem that exercised the ingenuity of great scholars of the eminence of Jacobi and Schubring. The present edition with notes which are so penetrating is a valuable contribution to the field of Jainological studies. The editor has the blessings, and inspiration of the great saint and reformer Acharya Sri Tulsi who has been indefatigably working for the spiritual, moral and cultural regeneration of the nation for more than three decades. The translator Muni Shri Mahendra Kumarji, B.Sc., has also done his job excellently, and we hope he would continue to do such work in the future with unabated zeal.

"Does my soul go on reincarnating, or does not my soul go on reincarnating? Who was I (in my previous birth) or after departure from here what shall I become in my next birth?"
ANNOTATIONS 1, 2: We observe that certain phenomena, which we call the phenomena of consciousness, are fundamentally different from the non-conscious or material phenomena. Hence the existence of consciousness (or more precisely, the conscient reality) has been accepted by almost all schools of philosophy, ancient as well as modern.

COMPREHENSION AND RENUNCIATION OF WEAPONS
As the phenomena manifesting consciousness are directly perceptible, there is no question of denying the existence of conscient reality. All the controversy that prevails in the world of philosophy regarding the conscient reality is about its eternity or ultimate independence.
Thus, there are two schools of thought: One which accepts the eternal and ultimately independent existence of the conscient reality or psychical reality or soul, and the other which denies it. The former is called "spiritualism", and the latter "non-spiritualism" or "materialism".
The non-spiritualists accept the existence of conscient reality (soul) but repudiate its transmigration - its past and future existence (i.e. previous birth and rebirth). Hence, they do not give importance to the question of the direct perception of soul or phenomena of transmigration. But for the spiritualists, the question is of the utmost importance.
However, all are not able to cognize soul or its transmigration directly. The following four questions constitute the enigma of the Spiritual Universe:
Where from have I transmigrated ? Where to shall I transmigrate? Who was I (in my previous birth), or After departure from here what shall I become in my next birth?

COMPREHENSION AND RENUNCIATION OF WEAPONS
Now, it a sadhaka (an aspirant exerting himself in asceticism for achieving self-realization) does not possess the extra-sensory power of perception, there are chances that due to lack of direct knowledge of soul or its transmigration, he may lose his faith in sadhana (the path prescribed for self-realization). In such cases, it is necessary to assist him to remain steadfast by making him directly perceive some transcendental phenomenon.
Bhagavan Mahavira, it seems, had the technique of helping his disciples remember their past life (or lives). Thus enlightened with the knowledge of eternal existence of soul, the aspirants would exert themselves with unflinching faith and fresh enthusiasm in sadhana,
This is well illustrated by the episode of Meghakumara, the son of king Srenika of Magadha. Meghakumara was initiated by Bhagavan Mahavira. On the very first night of his ascetic life, Meghakumara, disheartened by inconveniences in lodging thought of returning home. On the next morning, he approached the Lord.
The Bhagavan said - Meghakumara! You are perturbed because you had a disturbed night due to inconveniences, and now you are thinking of going back. Is it not so ?
Meghakumara - Yes, Lord. It is true.
Lord -- Meghakumara! In your previous life you were an elephant named Meruprabha living in a jungle. Once the jungle caught fire and the wild animals residing in it gathered in an arid zone outside it. The whole area got packed with all sorts of creatures. There was not an inch of space left. At that time you were also standing there. You had an itching sensation and you lifted your foot to scratch your body. Perchance, a hare happened to settle under the lifted foot. After scratching, when you wanted to lower your foot, you saw the hare sitting there. Out of compassion for the hare, you did not lower your foot, but kept it raised for two and a half days, after which the conflagration subsided. The creatures started returning to their own places and the hare too. Seeing the hare left the place, you tried to lower your foot. But it had become stiff and you fell with a bang.
Meghakumara! You forbore such a great hardship in

AYARO
your birth as an elephant, while now you are a human being and an ascetic too. Only a little discomfort has perturbed you. Is it worthy of you? Then you kept your foot hanging in the air out of compassion for one small hare and would now like to go back to worldly life where every step of yours would result in injury to countless beings?
On hearing this from the Lord, Meghakumara got lost in contemplation and introspection which brought back the memory of his previous life. This incident reinforced his faith and strengthened his unattachment, Tears rolled out of his eyes out of sheer ecstacy. He no more thought of his perturbance and resolved to follow the sadhana steadfastly. He bowed to the Lord and said - "Lord! I dedicate my whole body except the eyes to the services of the ascetic order. May the order utilise my humble services."
This is how Mahavira used to enlighten the sadhakas. In order to develop the memory of previous birth, a sadhaka would sit in meditation and concentrate his mind on any of the questions such as:
a. From which direction have I migrated to this birth?
Whether from the east direction or the west direction ? Whether from the north direction or the south direction? Whether from the direction above or below? Who am I?
Who was l in the previous birth? d. What shall I become in the next birth?
b
.
The ethical code prescribed by Bhagavan Mahavira mainly consists in the practice of non-violence (ahimsa). Its philosophical base is the existence of soul. Unless a sadhaka is enlightened with the unobscured knowledge of soul, he cannot have unflinching faith in the ethical code of non-violence. That is why the author of the scripture establishes the existence of soul in the very beginning of the present texte

4. Similarly some (people) come to know
"My soul goes on reincarnating, "That which transmigrates from these directions and
intermediate directions, and which has migrated to this life) from these directions or intermediate directions is none other than 'I' (my soul)."
ANNOTATION 4: 'Who am I?' (kohan) and 'I am Hel (sohan. these are two very important expressions in the discussion of the philosophy of Soul. The former manifests the inquisitiveness about the nature of one's own self, and the latter signifies direct recognition of the Self (I).
When the Acarya (teacher) was inquired of by his disciple as to what was the token of recognition of the soul, the Acarya replied, "I am He," The expression 'I am Her is thus a means of arriving at the right knowledge known as 'pratyabhijna' in logic, which means a logical conclusion based on the recognition of the object of the past experience with that of the present one. 'Ego', which experiences itself as the 'doer', through the assertions such as 'I do', 'I did', 'I shall do', is to be identified with the Soul (the conscient reality) and not with the body (the physical reality).
It may be mentioned that Soham (I am 'He') is also a chant in the Yoga system. There it signifies identification of soul with the Supreme Reality. 4. 0114141f, etirang, AFH14rf, fakturanti 5. Se ayavai, logaval, kammavai, kiriyavai.

Kriyavada - doctrine that actions are the cause of
bondage of soul.
ANNOTATION 5: The principle of non-violence is based mainly on the above four doctrines.
Soul by itself is imperceptible to any of the sense-organs. It is perceived only through the medium of body.
he world is also an ultimate reality just as the soul is,
The whole system of material body is governed by kar ma, The system of kar ma, in its turn, is governed by kriya - actions. The fundamental cause of diversities and changes in the world is action. So long as there are vibrations, disturbances and various sorts of emotions in the soul, it continues to be bound by the atoms of the kar - mas, which results in its continuous transmigration in different species. Transmigration or reincarnation clearly signifies the existence of soul. The cause of rebirth is the bondage of kar ma, and the cause of bondage is action. All this takes place 'in the world' itself. There exists in the world an infinite number of souls and material substances.
Cultivating discipline in our behaviour towards other souls and material substances is the fundamental basis of non-violence.

Consequences of Influx of Karma Particles
8. Only a person who does not comprehend and forswear
actions undergoes transmigration in various directions and intermediate directions, Loaded with the lot of accumulated kar ma particles, he wanders in all directions and intermediate directions, keeps on binding his soul to various genera and experiences (there) various sorts of feelings.
ANNOTATIONS 6, 8: These aphorisms furnish in short the essence of Bhagavan Mahavira's ideology which may be summarised as follows: Indulging in actions and abstaining from them are respectively the causes of transmigration and its cessation. The succeeding Acaryas have expressed this view in the following verse:
Asrvo bandhahetuh syat, Sarvaro moksakaranam. Itiya marhati drsti
Ranyada syah prapanchanam.. (Indulging in actions is the cause of the influx of Karma particles and hence the cause of bondage, while forswearing them is the cause of salvation. This is the essence of Bhagavan Mahavira's philosophy; everything else is merely elaboration).

(He, whose actions have been dissociated from attachment and desires, and have been consumed by the fire of knowledge is called bandita by the wise).
The Bhagavad Gita (17-2,3) also elucidates the terms karmayoga (actions controlled by spiritual discipline) and karma sa mnyasa (renunciation of actions).
The karmayoga enjoins one to persevering in actions, without having desire to get their rewards, abandoning the egotistic instinct, and dedicating their merits to God.
The karma -sammyasa, however, has been interpreted diversely by different scholars, thus
(a) Abstinence from the actions which are accompanied with rewards.
(b) Renouncing the desire for reward of one's actions. (c) Total abstinence from all sorts of actions (for every action is vicious).
1:
Bhagavan Mahavira, however, harmonised karma - sammyasa with karmayoga. His technique of achieving self-realization mainly consisted in samvara - the stoppage of the influx of karma particles through total abstinence from all actions. But this is not feasible in the very beginning. Therefore, it is advisable to refine the actions first through nirjara (by employing onself in right actions) and then to stop them. Total cessation of actions is achieved only on the verge of the final liberation.
The discernment of the indulgence in actions taught in the aphorism 7-12, thus includes both the karmayoga and the karma-sammyasa - refinement of actions followed by their cessation.

19. He (pseudo-monk), employing various kinds of weapons, indulges in actions involving earth, (thereby) causing violence to the beings of earth-body. (He causes violence not only to the beings of earth-body, but also) causes violence to different kinds of other beings.
ANNOTATION 19: In this world there are many kinds of beings and many substances. One man's food is another man's poison. A substance which is harmful to a particular kind of beings is termed as weapon for that kind. The term weapon is a general one which includes physical implements as well as processes which when operated upon beings would cause violence to them. The implements or the process may be homologous i. e. composed of the same material as body of the victims or heterologous, i. e. composed of material which is different from the body of the victims or combination of both. Besides physical weapons described here, there is the unrestrained impulse for violence which in itself is a psychic weapon. It should be noted that the psychic weapon is in itself the cause of pranatipata (sin of violence) irrespective of the operation or non-operation of the physical weapons.
The following nine kinds of weapons are enumerated in the Niryukti (the earliest commentary) on the Ayaro:
1. Implements such as plough, pick-axe etc. used for ploughing, digging, etc.;
ii. Horns of deer;
iii. Wood;
iv. Fire;
V.
Excretions;
vi. Homologous weapons, e. g. two different incompatible types of soil, when mixed,kill the earth-being;

30. Man (experiences pain) when forced into unconscious
ness or when deprived of life. (So do the beings of earth-body).
ANNOTATIONS 28-30: Once a disciple asked Bhagavan MahaviraO Venerable One! the beings of earth-body can neither see, nor speak, nor hear, nor move about. Then, how can one ascertain that it has life and it experiences pain on being struck or cut with some weapon?
Bhagavan Mahavira replied - O disciple! suppose that there is a man, who is blind, deaf, dumb, and crippled since his birth. Moreover, he is completely limbless-just a ball of flesh like the son of queen Mrga(vide, the Vipaka Sutra). Now, suppose that someone strikes or cuts him with weapon. The poor fellow, being blind etc. can neither see, nor hear, nor speak, nor move about. In the absence of vision, audition, speech, and locomotion, will it be right to say that the fellow is devoid of life and that he does not experience any pain on being struck or cut?
Bhagavan Mahavira further said. And again suppose that there is a man with normal physique. Some other men equipped with various sorts of weapons attack him cutting and severing simultaneously all the thirty two anatomical features of his body (enumerated in the 29th aphorism). Now, the man becomes blind, deaf, dumb and crippled. He can no more see, hear, speak or move about. Would it mean that he has no life? Would he not feel severe but inexpressible pain?
The disciple replied - Yes, Bhagavan! it is true that the man would feel the pain. But, my doubt is yet not resolved. For, there is a world of difference in the wounded man and beings of earth-body. Despite his inability to express his pain, the respiratory movements in the man are clearly visible, whereas they are absent in the said earthlives.
Bhagavan Mahavira said-It is not so, my disciple. The process of respiration is present in the beings body too, but it is not perceptible. Like a man in a swoon, the beings of earth-body do not manifest consciousness.

This is due to the constant coma produced by the "deep slumber producing" Karma, known as "Styanarddhi".
Further elucidating the point, Bhagavan Mahavira continued-A man in swoon may be unconscious either externally or internally. In the latter case, the inner consciousness is also benumbed, so that nothing is felt or experienced. But in the case of external swoon, only the external conssiousness is lost. The inner consciousness, being active, experiences pain. A similar state prevails in the beings of earth-body. They experience pain through inner consciousness on being struck or cut.
Gautama, the chief disciple of Bhagavan Mahavira, asked-On being attacked, what sort of pain does a being of earth-body experience?
Bhagavan Mahavira Gautama, suppose a young and
strong man hits an old feeble man on head with both his hands. What sort of pain does the old man feel on being hit on the head by both the hands of the young man?
Bhagavan! The old man experiences ex

-
Gautama cruciating pain. Bhagavan Mahavira Gautama! On being attacked, the being of earth-body experiences much more pain than that experienced by the old man1.
25
-
Thus, in the three illustrations, Bhagavan Mahavira has compared the state of consciousness and capacity to experience pain of the beings of earth-body with those of the persons, who are insensible since birth, rendered insensible with weapons, and in the state of swoon respectively.

damental tenet of religion. A crooked man cannot be religious. Religion abides only in a pure soul and only he who is straightforward is pure.
Crookedness is practised by him who wants to twist the truth. On the contrary, one who wants to present the truth without distortion is straightforward in all his activities of body, mind and speech. He would be practising what he preaches. In accordance with this, Bhagavan Mahavira has recommended the following four ways of practising truth:
(a) Guilelessness in bodily expression, (b) Straightforwardness of thoughts, (c) Ingenuousness of speech, (d) Harmony of speech and action.

the faith which one had at the time of renunciation, One should not be swept away by the eddies of mercurial mind.
ANNOTATION 36: When a sadhaka - an aspirant of the Moksa - is initiated into the path of sadhana, his zest is certainly like the crescent moon. Even the slightest diminution of it is not desirable. Yet, during the prolonged course of sadhand, it is not improbable that the sadhaka's faith may remit slightly. Here, therefore, the teacher admonishes the novice to ever invigorate his faith continuously in the path. In case he is not able to make any progress, he is expected at least to persevere in his sadhana with the initial intensity.
The eddies, the mental fluctuations, or the doubts, are the dangerous pitfalls for the sad haka.

37. The valiant Sadhakas have dedicated themselves to the
Great Path.
ANNOTATION 37: Non-violence is the path to liberation, It is everywhere, eternal and for everyone. That is why it is a Great Path. All those who have been dedicated to it or will be dedicated to it will attain liberation.
The Great Path also means Kundalini (vitality). An enterprising ascetic, for his sublimation, dedicates himself to this stream of vitality and makes it flow towards his brain through his spinal ehordConsequently his instinct of violence disappears. That conduct which is circumscribed by space and time is a smaller path. Equanimity is not so circumscribed. It can be practised in all space and time. That is why equanimity also is a Great Path.
Equanimity is not a creed. It is Religion in itself. All
se who have attained peace have treaded, are treading and will tread this Great Path. And yet it remains as capacious as ever.

(But) O man! in this ascetic philosophy(i.e. the philosophy of the Arhats), it has been propounded that water itself is living.
ANNOTATIONS 54-55: Here a fundamental distinction is drawn between the two kinds of beings existing in water:
AYARO
(1) Beings which make water their habitat,
(2) Beings which are embodied in water, i. e. water molecules themselves become the physical bodies. They are termed as beings of water-body.
The worms or micro-organisms which live in water have been accepted as life in water by all schools of thought. But the assertion that water molecules themselves become the bodies of living organisms viz. beings of water-body is to be found only in the philosophy of Bhagavan Mahavira.
It is quite clear from the above that beings of water-body cannot be separated from water unless they are killed by a weapon, e. g. boiling. It follows, therefore, that the purest water, i. e. water from which beings of the first kind are completely removed, is still animate (sachitta) water.
Inanimate (achitta) water is that in which beings of water-body have been killed. Water may thus be classified into four types:
(a) Animate water containing beings of kind (1) (b) Animate water devoid of kind (1).
(c) Inanimate water containing beings of kind (1) (d) Inanimate water devoid of beings of kind (1).
Water may also be classified as follows:
(a) Animate, (b) Inanimate, (c) Mixed.
When a weapon is operated upon animate water, it either becomes inanimate or mixed, according to whether the weapon used is powerful enough or not.

(The Buddhists contend:) "We are allowed to consume water both for drinking as well as for self-adornment purposes (such as bathing)."
ANNOTATION 59: There was a world of difference amongst the various schools of the sra manas regarding the usage of water by monks. The Jain ascetics asserted that usage of animate (or raw) water for any purpose was not free from the sins of violence as well as stealing.
On the other hand, the Ajivikas (i, e, a school of the sramana ascetics led by Makkhali Gosalaka), the Buddhists and some other ascetics contended that water was an inanimate matter and hence its use was free from the sins of violence as well as stealing. Thus some used water for drinking only, whereas others used it for bathing too. 80. gat apate faceifar i 60. Pudho satthehim viuttamti. 60. (Thus, quoting their own authority) they cause violence

Such ascetics are bold (for they have gallantly overcome the hardships met with in the path of sadhana), self-disciplined (for they have controlled their mind and senses), self-composed (for they have toned down their passions), and ever vigilant (for they are always on guard against stupefying activities).
ANNOTATION 68: Our knowledge of a substance may be either direct or indirect. Knowledge obtained through study, thinking, simple meditation etc, is indirect, Such a knowledge reveals only a few aspects of a substance, and they too may not be distinct, whereas knowledge obtained by higher meditation or on removing the veil of Kar ma particles obscuring knowledge, is direct. It is crystal clear and reveals at once all the aspects of the substances.
In ancient times, the ascetics through various techniques of meditation, used to gain direct perception of objects. The mechanical devices (like microscope etc.) are not the only things through which we can study or analyse a thing. Higher form of meditation and unveiled consciousness can also lead to direct perception of a thing. There are four stages for gaining direct knowledge: (1) Fortitude: facing hardships with brave and unwaver
ing efforts.

ANNOTATIONS 93-98; The word 'guna' signifies here the five types of sensual qualities viz., colour, sound, odour, taste and touch. These are existent in all directions east, west, south and north; up, down and sideways. Perception of these qualities through the sense-organs and feelings of attachment to them are two distinct phenomena. The Sadhaka is warned here to be on his guard against the latter. For, one who gets lost in the world of attachments becomes a slave of his desires which, subsequently, degenerates him into a wanton or a licentious person. Consequently he would not be able to follow the path of asceticism and hence leaving it, would become again a householder.

In case he does not become a householder, he would still act like one,even though remaining in the garbs of a monk.
Here, therefore, the evangelist has compared the sensual qualities with a whirlpool. Just as a person caught in a whirlpool finds it difficult to extricate himself out of it, so also a sadhaka caught in sensual pleasures cannot easily free himself from them.

AYARO
ANNOTATION 147: This aphorism can be interpreted in three different ways:
1) The intrinsic aspect of a substance is subtle, while the external one is gross. It is easy to comprehend the latter, but difficult to comprehend the former. One who can comprehend the former can distinctly comprehend the latter also. One who has comprehended the latter is able to know the former only through the medium of the gross. The soul is an inner-reality. Its conscious form cannot be distinctly comprehended. But its functions, manifested through the body, are gross and external. It follows from this that a body, devoid of consciousness cannot perform functions of consciousness. The functions of consciousness are the functions performed by the conscient reality (soul).
2) A person directly experiences pain and pleasure and as such they are immediate and self-perceptible. On the basis of the self-experience we can understand the pains and pleasures of others. Therefore, the feeling of pains and pleasures of others is an indirect one. The way in which we are affected by any external cause is the same in which others are affected and the way in which the others are affected by external causes is the same as the way in which we ourselves are affected.
3) Knowledge like the sun is self-luminary. Just as the sun is self-luminary and illuminates other objects, knowledge is self-luminary and enlightens other substances. The function of knowledge is to know the knowable. Knowledge is self-luminary and therefore reveals the spiritual substance-it reveals the self. It enlightens others and therefore it reveals the external world i. e. it reveals the whole gamut of knowable objects, distinct from the Self. But the knowledge that reveals the external world and internal world is one and the same. That is why, the author has laid down
One who knows the inner-self knows the external (world)
as well; One who knows the external (world) knows the inner-self as well.

Carnality is nothing but) mundane existence"; (and) mundane existence is (nothing but) carnality.
ANNOTATION 1: Sensual qualities may be either pleasing or displeasing. By having attachment to the former and aversion to the latter, passions are intensified, which in their turn extend the cycle of transmigration. Thus the root cause of mundane existence is sensual qualities. Hence, the author identifies carnality with the cycles of birth and death.
1. The word guna literally means quality. Here the qua
lities indicated are the five sense-data viz. sound, colour, taste, smell and tangibility. Ultimately, therefore, guna denotes carnal pleasures.
2. The term malatthana stands for samsara i. e, the cycles
of birth and death; in other words, the mundane existence of the soul.

ANNOTATION 5: The normal span of human life is about a hundred years. It can be divided into ten stages, each lasting for ten years. Till the end of the fourth stage (i. e. age of 40), his vigour and luster continue to increase, and are in full bloom. After that, deterioration sets in.
At fifty, the signs of decrepitude begin to appear. The eyesight begins to be affected. The power of the other sense-organs also begins to degenerate.
Senility then sets in, and vigour and lusture are replaced by infirmities. The vital organs then become progressively incapable of carrying out their functions; replacement of worn tissues is entirely stopped, and in the end, Death takes him away.

Then some day (towards the fag-end of life ),(his sense-organs) are overhelmed by senility (i. e. faculties of audition, vision, etc. cease to function).
ANNOTATION 6: The word 'mudha-bhavam' (lit. senility) has two meanings:
(1) Deterioration of the sense-organs e. g. incapacity to hear or to get hard of hearing.
(2) Infatuation-As the sense-organs deteriorate, sensuality increases.
Thus, an old man becomes senile as well as more lustful than before.

Against such a conviction, the spiritualist ideology puts before men the ideals of non-vidence and non-acquisitiveness, and establishes that life is possible even without perpetrating violence and acquiring wealth. Self-discipline in the form of ascetic life is the outcome of this doctrine. Asceticism (i. e. leading a life of self-discipline) is a subject of great surprise for those who lead a life lacking in self-discipline. Hence in the term of spiritualist ideology, "ahovihara" is used for "asceticism".

AYARO
ANNOTATION 63: The truth that "Happiness is loved and sufferings loathed" has been discussed here in the context of acquisitiveness. One who amasses wealth endeavours to get rid of his miseries and acquire happiness. While doing so, he does not care if he ruins the happiness of others. He forgets the fact that just as he likes happiness and loathes sufferings, others also do so. In the field of commerce and trade, dishonesty and exploitation practised in society are nothing but the results of losing sight of the above fact. Bhagavan Mahavira has repeatedly stressed this point and admonished that conduct should be based on the precept of self-equality.
64. svvesi jiiviyN piyN /  64. Savvesim jiviyam piyan. 64. Life is dear to all beings. 65. tN prigijjh dupyN cuppyN abhimuNjiyaannN sNsiNciyaannN tivihennN

samsimciyanam tivihenam ja vi se tattha matta
bhavaiappa va bahuga va. 65. In order that he may live, man owns and employs
bipeds (servants) and quadrupeds (animals). Through these he multiplies (his) wealth. Through threefold efforts (i.e. his own, that of others, and of both), a little or great amount of wealth comes in his possession,
66. se ttth gddhie citttthi, bhoynnaae /  66. Se tattha gadhie citthai, bhoyanae. 66. He remains attached to that wealth and (protects it)
for the enjoyment of sensual pleasures.

ANNOTATION 69. Just as the fruit of the mango is called mango, the seed of the mango is also called mango. Similarly, just as adverse feelings are called s fferings, the kar mas which are the cause of such adverse circumstances are also called sufferings. Those philosophers who see no chain relationship between cause and effect can never eradicate the root cause of unhappiness. Consequently it perpetually recurs resulting in stupification.

ANNOTATION 117. Even while acquiring food, clothing etc. the monk should abstain from acquisitiveness. The thought "I will use this food and clothing for myself only and will not share it with others, " is also acquisitiveness. "This, what I have obtained, does not belong to me, but belongs to the Preceptor and to the order" thinking thus, he should avoid falling a prey to acquisitiveness. Not to take unacceptable food, clothing etc., not to get attached to and not to hoard acceptable food, clothing etc. duly obtained all these are necessary to cultivate non-acquisitiveness.
Even for leading an ascetic life certain minimum utilities are necessary. They have to be obtained.

ANNOTATION 125: The first medium of disinfecting the mind from voluptuousness is the meditation on loka (universe):
(1) The term loka (universe) means objects of pleasure.
One such object is the body. Therefore, the term loka here stands for 'body'. It has three sections,
viz.
(a) The lower one - below the navel; (b) The upper one above the navel; (c) The middle one the navel itself.
Put in another way, these are:
(a) The lower one  the socket of the eyes, thyroid
cartilage, the middle of the face (cheekbones).
(b) The upper one  knees, chest, forehead: these
are the protruding parts.
(c) The middle one  the plain region.
A sadhaka should visualise that there are outlets everywhere viz. in the lower, the upper and the middle sections, (see, 4/118).
The meditational technique of visualising the body in its totality has been very significant. The present sutra is a pointer to it. The reader is referred to the sixth chapter of the Visuddhi magga, part I, pp. 160-75.

AYARO
Bhagavan Mahavira used to go in trance by meditating upon the upper, lower, and middle worlds (vide, Ayaro, 9/4/14).
Three methods of meditation are indicated by this,viz.
(1) Concentration of perception on the vault of
Heaven.
(2) Fixing the eyes on the vertical or slanting wall.
(3) Concentration of perception on the interior of
the earth.
Through the above three methods of meditation, Bhagavan Mahavira contemplated over the corresponding elements present in the three worlds respectively.
Thus, contemplation of the world has been prescribed as a medium of meditation,
Concentration of the mind on the objects present in the upper, lower and the middle world is the medium through which enthusiasm, boldness and perseverance are respectively nourished. (Cf, Namaskara Svadhyaya,p. 249).
(4) The second interpretation of the Sutra is: a
farsighted sadhaka notices that the lower world is afflicted with misery owing to attachments to sexual pleasure. So are the upper and the middle worlds.
(5) The third interpretation of this aphorism is
as follows:
Bhagavan Mahavira used to go in trance by meditating,
A sadhaka with vision knows full well the thought processes contributory to the elevation, degradation and medialization.
(6) The fourth interpretation can be in terms of trataka.
Concentrating on a point with dilated and unblinking eyes is called trataka. By accomplishment of

The enjoyment of sex can never appease the desire for it. That is why an amorous person keeps dodging it. The only way to alleviate desire is desirelessness (temperance). One who is conversant with the principle of the endless recurrence of cupidity is awakened to the realization that lust enslaves. And ultimately, he is redeemed of it.

ANNOTATION 127: The third means of banishing sensuality from the mind is the perception of the joints of the body. This means to realize that the body is mortal and just a conglomeration of various joints. The body is believed to have a hundred and eighty joints in all, out of which fourteen are called "great joints". These are: three joints in the right hand shoulder, elbow and wrist, three in the left hand, three on the right side below the trunk- hip joint,knee, ankle, three on the left side below the trunk, one in the neck and sacrolumbar joint.

ANNOTATION 129: The alternate translation of this aphorism is as follows:
There should be complete harmony between the internal self and the external behaviour of a sadhaka.
Some philosophers stressed on the purity of the internal self, while others that of the external behaviour. Bhagar an Mahavira did not accept either of these views. He viewed them together, and said: It is not enough to have the purity of the inner self only. The external conduct should also be pure, because it is the reflection of the inner self. It is not also enough to have purity of the external behaviour only. Without the purity of the inner self, it will be repression. That is why the inner self also should be pure. Confluence of the purity of the inner self as well as the external behaviour leads one to perfection of religious life,

ANNOTATIONS 129-130: The fourth agency of freeing the mind from sexuality is the cognizance of the foulness of the human body. It can be compared to a pitcher filled with filth which is trickling out from it. Thus it is dirty from within as well as from without. Similarly, this bodily claypot is internally replete with foul matter. This comes, out through the various outlets making the exterior also foul.

"Here is blood; there is flesh; Here is fat; there is bone; Here again is marrow; there again is semen."
The sadhaka thus looks into these and contemplates thoroughly over them.
The interior of the body means the pits and holes which the sadhaka sees in the body. He perceives the navel - the pit in the stomach, the hole in the ear, the armpits in the right and the left sides, the pores and other holes in the body. Thus, his desires are pacified.

who were independent,
The former used to take care of their bodies, while the latter did not. The latter did not take medical treatment, even when they suffered from diseases. It seems that this difference in practices came about in the post-Mahaviran era. In the beginning Bhagavan Mahavira prescribed that munis should not undergo medical treatment. This was possibly because of two reasons  non-violence and nonattachment to the body.
In medical treatment many an occasion arises when causing of violence becomes necessary. A medical practitioner causes violence as a part of treatment and this has been clearly brought out in aphorism 142. There is no denying that use of certain medicines will cause violence to worms etc.
Attachment to the body is also a form of acquisitiveness. A sadhaka practising non-acquisitiveness should be nonattached even to his own body. One who has given up attachment to his body and is completely indifferent to it, and who is in complete unision with his own soul, does not desire medical treatment. He leaves bodily affliction to take its own natural course. He endures it considering it as a result of his kar ma. He looks at life and death with equanimity and as such does not struggle for life nor try to avoid death. That is why, he never thinks about medical treatment.
There was a change in this line of thought during the post-Mahaviran era. At that time, two categories of sad - hana came about. In the first one, a medical treatment, in which no violence was caused by the medical practitioner, was permissible.

ANNOTATION 150: Violence, untruth, stealing, noncelebacy, acquisitiveness and post-sunset dinner these are six avratas (i. e. infringement of the six vows). Is it possible that anybody practising anyone of these six infringements can save himself from the non-observance of the other vows? Can any one who is acquisitive save himself from causing violence? Can anyone practising violence save himself from acquisitiveness? In reply to all these questions Bhagavan Mahavira laid down the following principle There are two fundamental evils- attachment and aversion. Violence, acquisitiveness etc. are nothing but their modifications. Motivated by attachment and aversion, if anyone practises acquisitiveness, he also commits violence etc. Complete forswearing of all the six avratas can be done jointly only and not separately. It is not possible that a muni may practise non-violence but not nonacquisitiveness or may practise non-acquisitiveness without practising non-violence. These great vows (i. e.. mahavratas) are practised simultaneously or violated simultaneously. They are acquired when pratyakhyanavarana -kasaya (which is one type of passion) has subsided, while they are violated when it comes into force. The mahavratas cannot be observed or violated in any number less than six. Therefore the above principle can be enunciated in the context of acquisitiveness as follows:
One who violates the vow of non-acquisitiveness also violates other Mahavratas namely, non-violence etc.
Another interpretation of this aphorism is as follows:
AYARO
-
It is possible that one who causes violence to any one (system of living beings) can cause violence to anyone of the six systems of living beings (i. e. he causes violence to all the six systems).
 2010_03
For a sadhaka,violence to all living beings is prohibited. This total prohibition creates the right temperament towards non-violence. If the killing of a particular system of beings is allowed and that of another system or systems of beings is prohibited, the right attitude towards non-violence cannot be friendly towards other systems of beings. In the epoch of Bhagavan Mahavira some friars used to justify themselves by saying that they killed no other living being except

beings of water-body. Some ascetics, belonging to the Sramana tradition, used to profess, "We perpetrate violence only for food and for no other purpose."
When Bhagavan Mahavira's disciples used to pass through the paths of the jungle, there was a derth of 'inani
water (cf. 1/54-55). In many cases monks died of thirst. It is probable that a question might have been raised as to what harm might accrue from drinking animate water under those dire circumstances.
Bhagavan Mahavira, after weighing the pros and cons of the issue, observed that an aspirant whose mind was filled with a dormant feeling of violence even towards a single system of beings could not stride the path of absolute non-violence.

thought-processes, on subjects in which men are not normally interested is helpful in the development of willpower. Sense-organs are a slave to sensuality, rather than
adifferent to it. Therefore, sometimes a sadhaka gets attracted to what 'the flesh is heir to! Hence he becomes apathetic to the practice of self-discipline. His determination begins to slacken. A sadhaka who cannot tolerate laxity, canalizes his thought-process in the direction of self-control. Thus, developing his will-power, he gains mastery over self-discipline.
The path prescribed by Bhagavan Mahavira, for the achievement of self-realization comprises the practice of constant vigilance and perseverance. In case a sadhaka is infatuated even momentarily by sensual delights, meditation
once does away with his stupor. Consequently, he esupes from the indelible impress of the pent up sensual impulses.
If wantonness is not purged away, the mind begins to contract passion. One cannot, then, get rid of carnality. Therefore, the author has exhorted the aspirant to be very careful in this regard.

The interpretation 'sa matvadar si seems to be more consistent, because a sa matvadarsi i. e. one who practises equanimity alone can eat unsavoury food with equanimity. The Dasaveyaliyam
(5/1/97) corroborates this contention. "Tittagam va kaduyar va kasayam, ambilam va mahuram

have instructed us on judicious Uberation from misery.
ANNOTATION 171. In common language, the experience which one does not like is referred to as sufferings. In the language of religion, the cause of sufferings is also called suffering. The bondage of kar mas is the cause of sufferings. Bhagavan Mahavira admonished the people thus -
There is bondage and there is cause of bondage. There is liberation and there is cause of liberation.
172. iti kmm prinnnnaay svvso /  172. Iti kamma parinnaya savvaso. 172. (In order to emancipate himself from sufferings) one

One who revels in the Self looks inwardly at the Self.
ANNOTATION 173. The fundamental mainstay of Bhagavan Mahavira's asceticism is apra mada ( i. e, complete lack of inertia, or constant vigilance). The first principle of this is close introspection.
The Bhagavan said, "Perceive, the Self through the Self."1 Not being an extrovert implies being an introvert. Hence, the aphorism. Thus the processes of introspection and revelry in the Self continue to follow each other.
Passions (e.g. the Id-impulses, indignation, conceit, deceit and avidity) are not the properties of the soul; and, therefore, a true introvert does not delight in them. 1. Dasaveyaliyar Culika, 2/11.

Knowing the Self is the Right Knowledge, Perceiving the Self is the Right Perception, Revelling in the Self is the Right Conduct. This alone is the path to salvation.
The second principle of apramada is  to live in the present, i.e. to identify oneself with the current activity. One who is absorbed in the present activity does not pay heed to any other activities. One who remains lost in the reminiscences of the past and imaginations of the future cannot live in the present. A person who is engaged in one activity while his mind is occupied with another cannot remain alive to the exigencies of the present concentration.

ANNOTATION 4. According to the Curni, this aphorism is translated thus: "One who thoroughly knows these sound, colour, smell, taste, and touch (i. e., does not have attachment or aversion to them) is one who knows the Self, Knowledge, Scriptures, Piety and the Supreme Reality.
Attachment to sound, colour, taste, smell and touch obstructs the realisation of the soul. One attached to them is the same as one who does not possess the soul while one who is not attached to them is the same as one who is in possession of the soul. One who is in possession of the Self gains possession of Knowledge, Scripture, Piety as well as the Supreme Reality is in possession of every thing. One who knows the soul knows knowledge, scriptures, piety as well as the Supreme Reality knows every
thing.

Ignorance is the translation of the world dukkham which literally means misery or suffering. As ignorance is the cause of misery, the author has used the word misery in lieu of ignorance. According to the Curni the cause of misery is karma. That is why he bas interpreted dukkham as karma. But ignorance is due to the Jhanavarana karma (i.e. the karma, obscuring knowledge). Hence, in the present context dukkham can be translated as ignorance.

A Jain ascetic (Nirgrantha) endures extremities of weather and does not fall a prey either to the ennui (created in the practice of self-restraint) or to the delights (produced by self-indulgence). He is unmindful of the pain.
ANNOTATION 7. Every person is destined to suffer adversities in this world. More so is a sadhaka who leads a life of non-violence and non-acquisitiveness. An ignorant person feels the pain of adversities, while a wise one is aware of adversities, but he does not allow them to make him suffer. His endurance is so much developed that he does not tag pain to his knowledge of it.
151
The word muni means a wise man. It comes from the root mun meaning to know'. According to the commentator, the word munti is explained as follows:
"Manute manyate va jagatah trikalavastham munih". 1.e.-one who knows past, present and future states of the universe.
2. Dharma means nature. Hence dharmavit means one who is conversant with the nature of Reality or that of the Soul in the context of sadhana.

Conversely when one is conscious of the Inner Self, he is unconscious of the external world. One who is conscious of the external world throws the Inner Self into oblivion; that is why he becomes unwatchful. Thus unwatchfulness means sinking into oblivion. One who is conscious of the Inner Self is constantly alive to it. Hence, he remains ever vigilant. Thus watchfulness means constant consciousness. Co stant consciousness means to be heedful and to throw into oblivion the causes which make one heedless.

The Author of the Curni interprets this term in tvo forms: (i) tirija, and (11) ativijja.
He states "Vijiatti he vidtan! anava ativiji."
The author of the vrtti, however, interprets it as attivinia, It seems that the erosion of the tradition of the interpretation of the term tilvija is the Cause of resorting to separation of the conjunction between canha and ativija. But according to one view, the text should be tiviija. The Buddhist literature has retained the tradition of its meaning in its original form. (See the annotation above). The word parama (i.e Supreme Reality) stands for truth or nirvana. The trinity Right Knowledge, Right Perception and Right Conduct being the means of achieving parama - 18 also termed as parena. The variant of sammatta (samstva) is sammatto (samyak tva). In the Aradyaka Niryukti, samyak va and amazina have been shown to be synonyms,

ANNOTATION 28. The three sciences are:
1. The science of memory of past births.
The science of knowing the animal kingdom. The science of critically analysing their (animals'). pleasures and sufferings.
2.
3.
One who has mastered these three sciences is called a trividya. According to the Buddhist tradition, tivija is three types of knowledge:
1. Knowledge of the past births.
2. Knowledge of birth and death (of beings).
3. Knowledge of purging of defilements of conscious
ness.
Attachment and aversion are two ultimate causes of Karma. They are the twin causes of loss of equanimity. One affected with attachment and aversion is too stupefied to retain equanimity or realise the intrinsic equality of. all animals. One who fails to realise this equality, commits sin by being attached to one or becoming averse to other. On the other hand, an equanimous person has neither attachment to anyone nor aversion to any other; that is why, he does not commit sin.

That is why a trividya, iving comprehended the Supreme Reality (becomes samyaktvadarsi i.e. possessing Right Perception). A samyaktvadarsi does not commit sin (1.e. indulging in violence, etc.) 'That a samyaktvadars never commits sin' is an aphorism pregnant with mysticism. One who realizes the true nature of sin is incapable of commiting any sin. Conversely, it is only he who does not know or realise its true nature, that commits sin.
AYARO
Janami dharamm, na ca me pravrttih. Janamyadharmam, na ca me nivrttih..
fi know the righteous way of life, yet I do not follow it. I know what is unrighteous and yet I do not refrain from it.' This is merely a superficial reflection. The right knowledge gained from profundity of consciousness does save one from indulging in unrighteous action.

ANNOTATION 34. Some philosophers believe in analysing only the effects (or remifications) and as such they never get to the root-cause of a phenomenon. They cannot fathom the depths of the problem, Bhagavan Mahavira concentrated more on the cause of the problem rather than on its effect. The root of all sufferings according to him is mo ha (delusion). The rest are its remifications.

The alternate translation of this aphorism may be done as follows:
Tbis (sadistic killing) is enough for an ignorant one to be bound by karmas. He incurs more and more enmity.
Lord Buddha once exhorted his disciples:" Mendicants! It is to be hoped that a person who perceives the element of terror in & vice would be redeemed of all vices in the world."

ANNOTATION 35: The soul does exist, but it is not visible. Passions attachment and aversion are impediments in preceiving it. They spread a shroud of karmas upon the soul, making it difficult to perceive itself. When the passions are weeded out, the soul becomes niskarma. (i. e. free from the veils of karmas).

Man achieves self-realization through extirpation (of attachment and aversion by practising self-restraint and penance).
37.
Self-realisation,
The fundamental basis of Mahavira's technique of sadhand is non-action. Reality is only that in which there is action. The natural activity of soul is action of consciousness. Any activity apart from this is not a natural one. To cease from un-natural activity is the secret of attaining natural activity. The moment the natural activity is attained, activities of attachment and aversion cease. Cf. 4/50.

dhuta (to be described in the chapter VI). Thereby attenuating the kar ma body, he ultimately gets rid of it.
From the point of view of sadhand, these aphorisms can be interpreted thus:
There are some sadhakas who neither give heed to the memory of the sensual pleasures of the past nor desire for future pleasures. Some other sadhakas assert that the past was not satiated with self-indulgence, and therefore, it follows that the future also would not be satiated with it.
It is the memory of the past pleasures and the desires for the future ones that breed attachment, aversion and delusion. That is why, the Tathagatas (i, e. the aspirants who strive for the attainment of the state of Perfect Equanimity) do not head the matters of the Past and Futurethey do not allow such state of mind to be created as is filled with attachment and aversion.
One whose conduct is such as to pacify or get rid of attachment, aversion and delusion is called as a "vidhuta - kalpa" of "one abserving the dhuta code of conduct".
One who is tathagata and vidhuta -kalpa is eyanupassi. which can be interpreted in three ways:
1. Etadanupasyi - One who observes the realities happening in the present only.
2. Ekanupasyi' One who observes the soulas 'solitary'.
3. Ejanupasyi  One who observes the vibrations (of the kar ma body) or transformations taking place on account of the observance of the dhuta code of conduct.
Such a sadhaka annihilates the kar ma body by remaining free from attachment and aversion.

whereas there is no weapon mightier than the state of disarmament.
ANNOTATION 82. Malice, hatred, wrath, etc. are various weapons, whereas friendliness, forgiveness, tolerance, etc. are means of disarmament. Different weapons have different degrees of destructiveness. As for example, X is less inimical to A, more inimical to B, still more inimical to C and so on and so forth. Thus does the intensity of enmity of X towards other persons vary. This shows that the edges of weapons have different degrees of bluntness or sharpness.
Violence is not only committed by the use of weapons but it itself is a sort of weapon. Violence means lack of selfdiscipline. One whose senses and mind are not under his control is a weapon to every living being. Abstinence violence is a non-weapon i. e. a means of disarmament, One's own restraint towards all living beings is nonviolence, One whose senses and mind are under his control does not act as a 'weapon' to all living beings.

AYARO
of (sentient beings) through the teachings, (should not become susceptible to the asravas).
ANNOTATION 12. Four different permutations obtain from the terms asravas, parisravas, anasravas and aprisravas. In the original text, the first and the fourth one are dealt with. The remaining two (i.e. the second and the third ones) are as follows:
Asravas are themselves aparisravas. Aparisravas are themselves asraras. Anasravas are themselves parisravas. Parisravas are themselves anasravas.
The present aphorism can be interpreted from various points of views:1. Subject (i.e. Soul): The first permutation is common. Usually every soul is open to the influx as well as the efflux of kar mas.
The second permutation is void, because influx is necessarily followed by efflux,
The third permutation holds good in the case of the state of the soul which is completely devoid of any vibrations. A muni, in such a state has no influx of karmas, but has only their efflux, i, e, outflow of accumulated kar ma
The fourth permutation concerns the liberated soul. He transcends both the influx and the efflux of kar mas.
II. Cause: For an unenlightened soul, all acquirements of worldly desires are the source of asravas. For an enlightened soul, on the other hand, these things them selves lead to parisravas. On the other hand ar hat(i.e. the Venerable One) or the mui becomes, the cause of parisrava for the enlightened and that of asrava for the unenlightened.
It follows from the above that there are as many asravas as there are parisravas.
To quote - Yatha prakara yavantah, samsaravesa -hetavah.
Tavantas tad viparyasad nirvanasukha -hetavah.. i.e. there are as such and as many causes of bondage in this world as there are those of emancipation.

III Operation: The movements of an undisciplined person lead to asrava, whereas those of the disciplined one lead to parisrava.
The present aphorism underlines the non-absolutistic nature of objects (or Reality). We cannot explain things, events or concepts in absolute terms.
Acarya Amitagati has mentioned this in his treatise Yogasara: Ajnani badhyate vatra, sevyamane(a)ksagocare;
Tatraiva mucyate jnani pasyatascaryamidrsam. i.e. just think how paradoxical it is that whereas the objects of sense organs put an ignoramus in fetters of kar mas, they become a vehicle for the emancipation of the sages.
IV Modus Operandi of Karina: Those who attract the kar - mas cause their bondage;
those who cause the bondage of kar mas attract kar mas; those who do not attract kar mas do not cause their bondage; those who do not cause the bondage of kar mas do not attract them.

THE TRUTH
197
ANNOTATION 32. The author of the Curni has explained the term 'Sole contemplation of the Inner Selft in terms of
'Sulitariness' and 'Separateness' as follows:
The soul indulges in actions, bears fruits, takes birth, dies and transmigrates, all in utter solitariness:
Ekah prakurute kar ma, bhunkte ekasca tatphalam.
Jaytyeko mriyatyeko, eko yati bhavantaram, Separateness-oriented meditation means the soul is separate from the body.
The explanation of the above aphorism by the commentator (Vrttikara) is as follows:
'I' have always been solitary: 'I' belong to none else;
'I' behold no one whom I can say I belong to nor do I behold one whom I can designate as mine.
Sadaiko(a)han na me kascit, naha manyasya kasyacit.. No tan pasyami yasyaham, nasau bhaviti yo mama.
The pith of worldliness is nothing but disaster. Who, whose and where are one's kith and kin? Who, whose and where are strangers? These kith and kin as well as strangers all go round in cycles of birth and death. At times, the kith and kin become strangers, and vice-versa. There comes a time when nobody remains as kith and kin and nobody a stranger.
Samsara evavamanarthasarah. Kah kasya ko(a)tra svajanah paro va. Sarve bhramantah svajanah pare ca, Bhavanti bhutva na bhavanti bhuyah.
Ponder thus: 'I am all alone. Nobody was mine in the past, nor will ever be in the future. It is because of my kar mas that I delude myself and consider others as mine. The truth is that I was alone in the past and will ever be all alone. !
(Ayaro, 5/59). Here the term 'Appanarn" stands for the state of soul in which it is overwhelmed by Ka saya (passions).

Just as fire quickly reduces the decayed wood to ashes, so does a sadhaka who is (totally) absorbed in the (inner) Self, and (completely) unattached (to all external objects) (shake to its roots, attenuate and wither away his karma-body).
AYARO
ANNOTATION 33: In this metaphorical aphorism, two means of shaking or agitating the karma body are indicated:
(a) Samadhi: complete concentration of mind on the inner Self i. e., pure consciousness.
(b) Anasakti: Complete unattachment to all external i. e. material objects including one's own body.
Indication of these two means makes it patently clear that here the term 'body' means the subtle karma-body, and not the gross audarika one. Emaciation of the latter is not in question.
A sadhaka emaciated himself by many long fasts, but his egotism remained as strong as ever. Wherever he went, he made a show of his long fasting and sought praise. An experienced and wiser ascetic advised him. "O brother! Wither away your sensuality, passions and egotism. There is no benefit in emaciating this gross body. We will never praise you because of your withered body. Mere withering of your gross body does not make you praiseworthy.
Indiyani kasae ya, garave ya kise kuru.

In the first place the muni should relinquish the relations (obtaining from objects, animate and inanimate); he should then subdue his mind and senses; and finally, he should resort to mortification (of flesh) in progressively increasing intensity.

201
ANNOTATION 40. There are two primary conditions for practice of asceticism.
(1) Relinquishing relationship.
(2) Subjugation of mind and senses.
After this, the sadhaka passes through three stages of sadhana.
(a) The first stage begins with initiation and endures till the completion of studies. During this stage he practises meditation to a limited extent and undertakes the austerities essential for scriptural studies.
(b) The second stage comprises of teaching the disciples and propagating the creed. During this stage he practises

deeper and longer meditation and also higher austerity (e.g. fasting for many days). .
(c) The third stage pertains to forsaking of bodily attachments. Having accomplished his own amelioration as well as that of the Religious Order, the muni engages himself in the preparation of the total forsaking of bodily attachments so as to attain the ultimate equanimity during the period of fast-unto-death. During this stage he practises meditations and austerities of still longer duration (i.e. fasting for a fortnight, a month or so on and so forth).
Progressive increase in the intensity of mortification of flesh is prescribed in proportion to the propriety and capability of undertaking practice of meditation and austerities. The intensity of mortification of kar ma-body will also correspond to it.
These are also the three stages of the dissociation of the soul from the body.

heroic and wise muni", engaged in what is Right, and 1. One, whose mind is free from unhappiness, fear and
sorrow, is called 'Avimane' (i, e. blissful). The Sanskrit equivalents of the world Sarae' could be 'Svarata', 'Sa mirata', Saraka', and 'Sarada'. The authors of the Curni and the Vytti have annotated the word Svarata. Svarata is one who is engrossed in austerity, righteousness, detachment, vigilance, knowledge, perception and asceticism, and disciplined deportment and self-control. Dr. Herman Jacobi has translated this term as saraka (i. e. a person of pith). In the Sutra -krtanga, we find that the word visarada has been used in three places (1/3/50, 1/13/13,1/14/17) In view of this, the form sarada seems to be proper one who is expert at grasping gist is visarada i.e. wise one).

43. vigic mNs-sonniyN /  43. Viginca mamsa -soniyam. 43. Abandon (amassing) flesh and blood (i.e. physical
vigour).
ANNOTATION 43. One of the causes of engendering the sex impulses is amassing physical vigour (flesh and blood). Hence, a muni should refrain from this. But the question here arises: Why should he do so? Why should he not build up muscular strength which is necessary for a healthy body which, in its turn, is essential for practising religion ? Then why should it be deliberately weakened?
The answer is attenuation of physical vigour, however, does not imply extreme emaciation, but, in reality, it means controlling the physical strength to such an extent that it does not stimulate sensuality.
Dieting (avoiding rich articles of food) does not produce excess of blood which in its turn, does not allow accumulation of flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and semen respectively in the body. Dieting, therefore, automatically constitutes the sadhana of mortification of flesh (vide, aphorism 40).

meanings: (a) Acara Asceticism. (b) Chastity i.e. abstinence from sexual acitivity
of any sort. (c) Staying within the monastic order. Here, however, it has been used in the sense of asceticism. Chastity is, as a matter of fact, a part and parcel of asceticism.

The gist of both is acara i.e. asceticism, and the kernal of asceticism is dissolution of kar mas and finally, salvation,

ANNOTATION 46. Until the impress of erotic desires is completely obliterated, it keeps rearing up its ugly head even in the midst of ascetic practice. Consequently, even a self-subdued sadhaka sometimes succumbs to the assault of sensuality. But, when through severe perseverance in sadhana, a sadhaka completely eradicates the id-impulses, they are once and for all extinguished. They do not, then, occur, either in the beginning or in the end or in the middle - in fact, never. In the event of non-existence of the past impressions, one cannot conceive the future. And in the absence of these two, one cannot think of the present.

The word 'nikka mma' (Skt. niskarma) can be interpreted in five different senses:
(1) eternity, (2) immortal, (3) salvation, (4) stoppage of the influx of kur ma and, (5) the Soul.
One, who is, inclined towards karma:, is bound by karmas; while one who visualizes niskar ma attains niskar ma. Visualisation of niskar ma is an important principle of the practice of Yoga.
This can be achieved by concentrating all the tendencies of the mind on it. During such concentration, one should perceive nothing else but the soul or the means of selfrealisation,

One, who becomes inquisitive, discovers (the true nature of) the phenomenan of transmigration, i.e. knows the knowable and relinquishes the reprehensi

One who is not inquisitive cannot discover (the true nature) of the phenomenon of transmigration.
ANNOTATION 9. Inquisitiveness is the starting point of philosophy. In the present sttra, this very truth has been expounded. One who does not speculate - does not become inquisitive - cannot realise the Truth. Even Gautama, the chief disciple of Bhagavan Mahavira, often had queries, and he used to get the solution by inquiring of Bhagavan Mahavira.
"Samsayat ma vinasyati (i.e. a person smitten by equivocation meets with doom.) - In this famous expression the word samsaya has been taken to mean samdena (i. e.. equivocation). The same truth has also been expressed in the aphorism 5/73 of the present text, viz. "A person afflicted with incertitude cannot attain samadhi (i. e. absolute equipoise).
"Na samsa ya manaruhya naro bhadrari pasyati".
"(i. e, unless one resorts to inquisitiveness, one cannot attain beatitude). This half couplet echoes the gist of the present aphorism.

tally perceives in meditation the state of the body every moment), (remains ever vigilant).
ANNOTATIONS 20-21. The Sadhana propounded by Bhagavan Mahavira essentially consists in 'remaining vigilant moment after moment'. Out of the various techniques prescribed for remaining vigilant, the prime one is to perceive in meditation with the mind's eye the phenomena and sensations taking place in one's own body. A sadhaka who concentrates his perception on the sensations of pain and pleasure ever present in the gross body, - i.e. one who discovers the state of the body every moment - remains vigilant. This meditational technique of concentration of percep
the body leads one to become introvert. Thus the gross body serves as a medium of turning the outwardly directed flow of consciousness inward.
The two subtle bodies - the taijas (i. e. the electrical body) and kar ma-body exist in the interior of the gross one and the soul is further in the interior of these two, One who practises the concentration of the perception of the phenomena and sensations of one's gross body, gradually succeeds in perceiving the subtle bodies. By further practice of this technique of meditation and training the mind for such perception, one begins to realize the current of consciousness flowing in the gross body. As the sadhaka proceeds progressively from perceptior of the gross to that of the subtle, the intensity of his vigilance increases.

(Addressing a religious assembly, Bhagavan Mahavira proclaimed - ) "The harmonization in the practice of Right Knowledge, Right Perception and Right Conduct brought about by me in my sadhana, is rare to find elsewhere. That is why, I assert that (you should attain the integration of the triad, and, not let your powers lie dormant."
ANNOTATION 41. In the days of Bhagavan Mahavira, different philosophers emphasised separately one of thethree paths viz; Knowledge, Devotion and Action for the attainment of salvation,
According to Bhagavan Mahavira, merely one path was inadequate for the attainment of salvation. On the contrary, a harmonious blending of the three was essential for it. He had practised severe austerities in conjunction with the pursuit of knowledge and perception during the period of sadhana, because austerities are an integral part of conduct. Buddha, however, discarded (mortifying) penances. This might have been discussed among the disciplies of Bhagavan Mahavira. It could well be that some of his pupils also questioned the need of those austerities. It looks as though under those circumstances Bhagavan Mahavira laid down this proposition.
Bhagavan Mahavira said that he had practised severe austerities far away from the population and that he had experienced that it was not in vain, but was very useful in the sadhana. He further said, "I tell you my own personal experience. Use your energy as much as you can in practising austerities together with the pursuit of Knowledge and Perception."

Some persons do rise up, but fall down afterwards. Some persons neither rise up at all nor fall down afterwards.
ANNOTATION 42. There are two possible behavioural patterns of those who have renounced the world. Some sadhakas keep up the same zealous leonine spirit with which they renounce, while others, although renouncing with leonine spirit, practise it with a craven cowardly one.
For example, Dhanya and Salibhadra were initiated by Bhagavan Mahavira. They passed their ascetic life in spiritual studies, meditation and practising austerities, and finally attained death through 'fast unto death' together with the observance of perfect equanimity. This is an example of the person rising up and remaining awakened life-long.
On the other hand, example of the second category is found in the lives of Pundarika and Kundarika. They were brothers. Kundarika got initiated into ascetic life. Later on, when he became ill, king Pundarika arranged for his medical treatment. Kundarika recovered, but at the same time, he became lax in the observance of the monastic conduct. He abandoned the ascetic life and returned to the worldly life. This is an illustration of the person rising up and then falling down.
The third category is that of a person who never renounces the worldly life.

Fight with the karma body. Do not let it overwhelm you. And also resist this physical body which yearns for sensual pleasures by subduing the senses and the mind.

The Bhagavan thus exhorted the disciples to fight an internal battle. Explaining the strategy of the battle in question, the Bhagavan further said, "Continue battling along before the old age sets in, diseases attack and the senses become numb.

perceives worlds (of sensual objects and violence) in a different perspective (i.e, other than that of the
laymen). ANNOTATION 50. For one who is addicted to sensual objects and violence, the forms of the sensual objects are the be-all and the end-all of life and violence is the panacea of all ills. But one whose attitude is changed does not remain attached to the sensual objects and violence. He, then, takes worldly objects for transitory things, and considers them to have painful consequences, and violence as the root cause of all problems. He realizes that all problems and miseries in this world (are engendered mainly by violence). 1. Cf. 3/83.

See! What is right (conduct) is (right) knowledge and what is (right) knowledge is right (conduct).
ANNOTATION 57. From the pragmatic point of view, knowledge and conduct are distinct from each other. But from the point of view of ultimate truth, they are not poles apart. The culmination of Right Knowledge and Spiritual Experience is Right Conduct (i.e. self-discipline or asceticism). The aim of the aphorism is to underline the fact that self-discipline is the sum and substance of Right Knowledge. How can knowledge which is not conducive to self-discipline remain Right and Proper unto the last? The purport of the author here is to elucidate the unity of Right Knowledge and Right Conduct. According to him, Right Knowledge implies existence of Right Conduct, and vice-versa. We can infer the existence of one from the other.
Another Sanskrit equivalent of the word samma can be samya' (besides samyak). This interpretation which means equanimity is very relevant here. If we choose this inter pretation the present sutra can be translated thus:
See! What is equanimity is asceticism; and what is asceticism is equanimity.

The porter also got infuriated and they came to blows.
There was another immature sadhu, who acted negligently. The teacher gave him a bit of his mind, whereupon he asked "What on earth have I done? Why did you insult me in the presence of all these sadhus? Do not other sadhus ever indulge in such negligent behaviour?" And he went on grumbling.

A scholarly muni, possessing profound knowledge of the canonical texts extant can also be considered as prabuddha.

Siya vege anugacchamti, asiya vege anugacchamti, Anugacchamanehim ananugacchamane kahan na niyvijje?
94.
Some sadhakas follow (the path of sadhana) by taking guidance from (the preceptor), while some do so without it. (But) how can a sadhaka who does not follow (the path of sadhana), living amongst those who follow (the path of sadhana), remain free from despondency (towards the practice of self-discipline)?
ANNOTATION 94. The state of mind of
zka which flows from despondency is described in the following two categories of hardships viz. prajna parisaha and ajnanaparisaha discussed in the Uttaradhyayana Sutra (2/40-43):
"A monk should never succumb to the onslaught of despondency due to ignorance by thinking thus: It is undoubtedly myself who, in the past, had indulged in actions which did engender ignorance as their consequence: it is on account of them that I know nothing, (not even how to answer) any question put to me by anyone. (40)
1. The authors of the Curni and the Vytti have interpreted
the words siya and asiya as sita and asita i.e. "householders" and "ascetic" respectively. We have, however, interpreted them as srita and asrita in our translation. The alternate translations of the aphorism can be done as follows: 1. Some mimis follow the acarya), while some house
holders also do so, (but) how can one who does not follow (the path of sadhana), living among those who follow, remain free from despondency (towards the
practice of self-discipline). 2. (When the acarya ellucidates a subtle philosophical
point), those who have (doubt) for such explanation, comprehend it and those who are free (from doubts) also comprehend it. (But) how can one who does not comprehend it, living among those who comprehend it, remain free from despondency (towards the practice of self-discipline).

"The kar ma, which as its consequence engenders ignorance, and which even if accumulated in the past, starts giving its fruits on rising." - Knowing thus the consen' quences of the karma, a muni should console his own soul. (41)
"I abstained from sexual intercourse and curbed my senses and mind - all this has been in vain. For I do not know directly or positively whether righteousness is beneficial or deterimental. (42).
"'I practise austerities and religious observance. I have also undertaken special course of sadhana, In spite of following such (higher) code of sadhana. I have failed to obliterate the veils of kar ma obscuring knowledge." (43) - Muni should never think in such terms."
Also such a state of mind is comparable with the first dukkha -sayya (i.e. living in gloom) described in the Sthananga Sutra (4/450).

may also differ. A person devoid of direct (or Transcendental) Perception can judge a particular course of action only through exercising his own unbiased discretion, but he cannot judge if that course of action is actually right or not. Therefore, the canonist has asserted here that, for one whose conscience is pure and whose discernment is unprejudiced, a particular course of action is right, if it is felt so empirically. In the same way, anything propounded to be improper by him is improper, whether it is in reality improper or not.
Thus a sramana who practises any course of action in an unbiased way, is aptly called as the Truth-seeker. This very fact has been mentioned in the present sutra. It is perfectly consistent with the description of the five vyavaharas (Cf. Sthananga Sutra, 5/124).

One who you think should be killed is none else but you.
ANNOTATION 101. Bhagavan Mahavira was the propounder of the doctrine that all souls are equal to one's own soul. This parity has been expressed in the present sutra. Its purport is to establish the equality of feelings of two different souls,

ANNOTATION 102. The term arju (Skt. Rju) means ingennuous, self-disciplined or one who is keen to lead a selfdisciplined life. The purport of the sutra is that a wise man should abstain from violence, not through hypocrisy or fear, but through ingenuousness and spirit of self-discipline.

The Soul
104. The soul is that which cognizes; that which cognizes
is the soul. Because it cognizes, it is soul.
ANNOTATION 104. That which knows, is the soul; that through which knowledge is gained, is also the soul. In these two sutras, have been laid down the two definitions of the soul. The first of these two relates to substance, and the second to quality. The conscient soul is substance; consciousness, its quality. In other words, the former is the 'cognizer' and the latter, 'cognition'. Both the 'cognizer', and 'cognition' are one and the same, i. e. the soul. The 'Conscient' reality is not directly perceptible, but 'consciousness' is. Just as a person sitting inside a room can infer the existence of the sun through the sun-light, so can the existence of the 'cognizer' be deduced from the process of knowledge. We know the 'knowable through knowledge'. Hence, it can be said that we know (the existence of) 'knowledge through knowing the knowable. Also, since 'knowledge' is the light of the 'knower', we know the 'knower through knowing the existence of 'knowledge'.
Soul is the substance', while knowledge is its quality. A substance and its quality are neither wholly identical nor wholly different. A quality always inheres in a substance, and hence both of them are identical. On the other hand, since one is the 'substratum', while the other is 'supported', both are different.
Knowledge, however, is the characteristic of soul. Hence, both are invariably concomitant.

The point here is: if the soul and knowledge are considered to be absolutely one and the same, even a single soul will become manifold, like knowledge. The present aphorism is clarification of this point - there are numerous manifestations of knowledge. Only on the basis of the phase of knowledge through which the soul passes at the particular moment, the right appellation of the soul can be ascertained. The soul which is occupied in cognizing through the sense of hearing is designated as the 'auditor' soul. Similarly, the soul engaged in gaining knowledge through mental processes is called 'psychic' soul. The soul occupied in cognizing such knowable entities as field, flag, chariot, horse, etc. can be called the percipient of field, flag, etc. Cf. Bhagavati Sutra,(6/174) - Gautama - "O Bhagavan! Is the soul a jiva or is conciousness a jiva ?"
Bhagavan - "Gautama! the soul is certainly a jwa and so is consciousness."

Se bemi - se jaha vi kumme harae vinivittha-citte, pacchanna-palase, ummaggam se no lahai. I illustrate (my point through a metaphoz.): Say, there is a tortoise (inhabiting the confines of a deep lake). The tortoise's mind is attached to the lake which is covered with moss and lotus-leaves. It (the tortoise) is unable to find a suitable opening (for getting a
glimpse of the limitless sky). ANNOTATION 6. The full purport of the metaphor in this aphorism is as follows: There was a large and deep lake

covered with layers of thick moss and lotus-leaves and full of all sorts of amphibian creatures. Once it came to pass that an aperture of the size of a tortoise's neck developed in the thick layers of moss. Dissociated from its family, a tortoise once accidentally happened to pass that way. It popped its head out of the hole and looked at the star-studded blue sky. Delighted, it thought to itself, "Why not get my entire family here and let them enjoy this beautiful sight?" So it went back, it brought its family with it and started off in search of the hole. But, as ill-luck would have it, it could never find it again. The vastness of the lake completely bewildered it.
This world is like the lake and man (householder) here is like the tortoise. "Kar man" is like the moss. Right perception is the aperture (hole) through which the limitless horizon of self-discipline (or asceticism) can be seen. But if one goes back to the household life even after perce the sky of ascetic life, and becomes attached to worldly life, he is not able to get back the glimpse of the ascetic life.
This metaphor illustrates the dejection that accompanies a sadhaka 'lacking spiritual insight.

1. The Curni and the Tika explain the text 'pakuvai' (in
place of 'pagabbhai'). And therefore the translation would be - one, afflicted.... ignorant one tortures other beings (for the sake of mitigating his own miseries) but the text in Uttaradhyayana Sutra 5/7 is-" iti bale pagabb hai;." The author of the Curni here has taken "pagabbhai" to be a variant reading. This appears to be deeply meaningful and appropriate.

(They give up the ascetic life simply) because they are unable to endure the intolerable hardships which continue to become successively severer.
ANNOTATION 32. The hardships (rigours) fall in two categories: agreeable and disagreeable. The temptation of sensual pleasure arising out of sound, beauty, etc. is agreeable hardship. On encountering these agreeable hardships, if one indulges in sensual pleasures, and on their cessation, if one reminisces them, he cannot endure these rigours. The converse of this is equally true. The same is the case with the 'disagreeable' hardships.

(b) Nothing belongs to me except the disciplined Way of life, hence let me carry out the instructions of the Tirthankara and follow aright this path.

ANNOTATIONS 47-49. If, after having accepted the ascetic way of life, one goes back to his family life, he is said to be an 'agamana dharma'. The reason for going back to one's family life is inability to forbear various kinds of rigours and hardships. A person who withstands enticements of sensual pleasure, etc., rigours like being up-braided, nudism and begging alms, does not return to his family life. He becomes what is known as "anagamana dharma. Bhagavan Mahavira laid down the principles of nonviolence, and forbearance of hardships as the Way of life. Only if a person is conversant with it, can he remain completely unperturbed by the onset of various hardships; and it is only that person who remains. unperturbed by them

ANNOTATION 67. During the period of scriptural studies, a muni undertakes fasting, dieting or eating non-fat-producing food. This leads to emaciation of his body indicated by his lean and thin arms. On account of eating little or decalorised food, little nourishment is produced in the body, which in its turn is responsible for under-production of flesh and blood. Consequently, the body gets emaciated. Also, because of constant preoccupation with hard studies, the body loses weight. Thus austerities both external and internal-cause attenuation of the body.

aphorisms relating to curtailment of belongings are applicable also to the attenuation of the body. Accordingly, these aphorisms (viz. 63, 64 and 65) can be translated thus:
63. A muni who is absorbed in the acquisition of knowledge and practises austerities is blessed with the attenuation of the body.
64. Attenuation of the body facilitates for him the practice of tapa i. e. austerity.

A muni who practises equanimity does not despise

(b) Asamdina: In the context of 'island' the word means 'the land which does not get flooded with water.' In the context of 'lamp' or 'light', the word denotes 'perennial sources of light, such as the sun, the moon, various gems, etc.

During the period of his sadhana, however, passionate instincts and impulses which might have been repressed and relegated to the subconscious, may continue to trrment him in the form of crude urges for sensual pleasures. Nevertheless the alert (apramatta) sadha ka would constantly reinforce the power of his reasoning mind and weaken the forces of primal urges by systematic practice of meditation. Thus, he canalises his aggressive urges into the mainstream of self-realization.

According to the Nagarjuna's redaction of the Scriptures, only that muni is competent to expound religious doctrines in public who is widely learned and an erudite scholar of the Aga mas, is adept in logic and illustration, able to discourse and sermonize, and understands the proprieties of time, place and audience. In this context, attention is drawn to the aphorism 2/177 (viz. Ke yam purise kam ca naye). Preaching for the sake of earning one's livelihood is forbidden.

Attachment can be forsworn by perceiving it. One who does not perceive it, cannot forswear it. In the method of sadhana laid down by Bhagavan Mahavira, knowledge and perception amount to watchfulness or alertness. Therefore, it constitutes an important method of forswearing attachment. The stronger the Knowledge and Perception, the weaker the effects of karma. On the weakening of the effects of karma, attachment is extinguished by itself.

virtue of the fact that he has his body attenuated and his passion well-curtailed through vigorous external and internal austerities, like (the two sides of) a beam well-chiselled and evened out. When Death is imminent, he should allow it to take its own time (rather than wish it immediately), until at last the soul is separated from the body.
- I say so.
ANNOTATION 113. Death is really a battle. One who comes out victorious in the battle is blessed with splendor, whereas one who is vanquished is deprived of it. Similarly, a sadhaka, engaged in the battle with Death, attains the pinnacle of sadhana, if he boldly remains unattached. On the contrary, if he gets defeated in the battle (i. e. if the fear and anticipation of Death haunts him), he deviates from the path of self-discipline.
Hence, the author of the Agama has laid down that one should not lose his wits, on encountering the Death. But for this, one has to be prepared beforehand; one cannot hope to escape Delusion at the eleventh hour. This preparation consists of attenuation of body and passions. Cf. Sutrakytanga Sutra, 1/7/30.

ANNOTATION 1. A san anuina is a monk whose faith, attire, deportment etc. can be approved of, and an asa manu - ina is just the reverse of a samanujna. For a Jaina muni, another Jaina muni is samanujna, while a heretic muni is asamanujna. According to the religious code of conduct prescribed for a muni, he is allowed to exchange food, drink, etc. with only a sadharmika muni (i. e, one belonging to the same faith). But a sadhar mika may also be an apostate. A muni can neither give him nor accept from him anything. Therefore two adjectives have been used for sadhar mika:
a) Sambhogika, and b) Samanujna
- (Nisinajj hayanan, 2/44).
The
gika is one with whom the exchange of things is permissible in accordance with the code of conduct. The sa manujna is one with the same deportm ents.
The Nisitha (15/76-77) prescribes expiation for giving food, drink, clothes etc. to a heretic monk, a householder or an apostate, 2. dhuvN ceyN jaannejjaa--asnnN vaa paannN vaa khaaimN vaa saaimN vaa

14. "Where should we practise Religion, in the village or
in the forest?"
"You should know that religious practice has nothing to do with the village or the forest," the wise Mahana (Bhagavan Mahavira) has propounded
thus. ANNOTATION 14. Some sadhakas believed that religion could be practised only in a village,whereas others believed that it could be practised in the forest. On being questioned by a disciple, the preceptor answered that religion is not concerned with either the village or the forest, but with the soul. It is always through the soul that one practices religion. As a matter of fact, religion is nothing but the nature or essence of the soul. We find the same idea expressed in a different way by Pujyapada Devanandi in the following couplet:
"Gramosa Franya miti dvedha nivaso natmadarsinam. Dystatmanam nivasastu viviktatmeva niscalab."

(fixed in) the pure soul." 15. jaamaa tinnnni udaahiyaa, jesu ime aariyaa sNbujjhmaannaa

samutthiya. 15. Persons belonging to three age-groups (can be
initiated). After being enlightened, the noble ones belonging to any one of these three age-groups can
initiate themselves into ascetic life. ANNOTATION 15. Although a man's total life-span of a hundred years is divisible into ten different age-groups, the three age groups referred to here have been mentioned in the context of initiation into ascetic life. The first stage extends from the age of 8 years to that of 30 years; the second, from 31 years to 60 years; and the third from 61 years onwards. The barivrajakas (one of the schools of ascetics, who used to move about) did not initiate persons below the age of twenty. The people who followed the vedic religion used to embrace renunciation in the last stage of their life.
The Buddha did not allow a person below the age of twenty to be ordained, (- Vina ya Pitaka, Bhikhhu Patimokha, 65). But an adolescent capable of frightening away a crow was allowed to become a probationer. (- Vinaya Pitaka, Mahavagga, Maha skandhaka, 1/3/8).
But according to the Jaina convention, the age of eligibility for initiation was just after eight years and a quarter. 16. je nnivvyaa paavehi kmmehi, anniyaannaa te viyaahiyaa /  16. Je nivvuya pavehish kammehim, aniyana te viyahiya. 16. Those who have ceased to perpetrate actions like
violence, etc. are called anidana (free from the bonds of attachment and aversion).

Despite the monk's refusal, if the householder were to light fire to warm up the former's (shivering) body, the monk, bearing in mind the instructions of the Agamas, should politely but firmly say, "I am sorry, I cannot avail myself of the warmth of the fire (as it entails injury and violence to the living beings embodied in the fire)."

43.
A monk who abides by the vow of possessing only three pieces of cloth and a bowl does not desire to beg for a fourth piece of cloth.
ANNOTATION 43. A monk is allowed to keep in his possession at the most three pieces of cloth out of which two should be cotton and one woollen. The method of overspreading them is as follows:
At first a cotton cloth should be draped (wrapped around one's body). If this is not enough to keep cold out, the second cotton cloth should be overlaid. If this too fails to protect one from cold, then in that case the remaining woollen cloth should be worn. The convention has been that the woollen cloth is the last to be worn.

If, by any chance, clothings are difficult to obtain till the next winter, only the most worn out robes should be given up and the rest kept with him, but not used.
If one of the three robes is more worn out, it should be discarded, and the remaining two kept.

ANNOTATIONS 57-61. When a monk goes for alms, his own relatives may try to persuade him to stay with them, or if he visited another family, some woman of that family getting enamoured of him, tries to seduce him into living with her. Confronted with such a predicament, what should a nuni do ? This has been discussed by the author of the scriptures in the present discourse.
Ending one's own life is of two kinds: (a) bala-marana - suicide committed due to irrational impulses, and (b) pandita marana - the one committed by conscious judgement. Vehanasa (i. e, committing suicide by hanging etc.) falls n the former category. Anasana (i.e. undertaking fast unto death) exemplifies the latter (vide, Bhagavati Sutra 2/49). But how can a monk practise anasana in such an

emergency as above?
Vehanasa death has been prescribed and approved of in such circumstances, for the sake of keeping the monk's chastity intact. Therefore it is not instance of bala-marana.
The author of the Curni cites an interesting case of a monk who finds himself locked in a room in which he discovers, to his utter dismay, his former wife introduced in it by his relatives. He is unable to come out of it. Now, the woman tries to seduce him. He should then pretend to be a dead man by suppressing his breath. As soon as he finds a suitable opportunity, he should try to pretend to put a noose around his neck. If, then, the woman takes pity on him and asks him to leave rather than commit suicide, he should come out of the room. If, however, the woman continues her advances, he should hang himself to death. To be forced to commit suicide in this way is not deemed to "bala-marana". This has been approved of by Bhagavan Mahavira.

Conscious Preparation for Death
105. If a monk feels - 'Infirmity is forcing my body to
cease functioning and I cannot do my duties (at the right time)', he should gradually reduce his diet, and through this reduction, try to chisel his passions (anger, pride, deceit and avarice) (just as a carpenter does a beam).
After attenuating his passions, a monk who has completely subdued his emotions and has his body attenuated and passions well-curtailed through vigorous external and internal austerities, like (the two sides of) a beam well-chiselled and evened out, and, having thus prepared himself for Death Sublime (sa madhi-marana), should become free from attachment and activities of body.
ANNOTATION 105. Generally one becomes infirm through some sort of disease. But, as the author of the Curni has pointed out, insufficient food, little or no clothes, or squatting for hours on end like a cock etc. also make one infirm. Severe austerities may also result in infirmity. When the body becomes extremely emaciated, the monk should prepare himself for Death Sublime through gradual attenuation (samlekhana). The main constitutents of attenuation are:
(a) Gradual reducing of diet. (b) Scrupulous diminution of passions. (c) Keeping the body in a state of stillness.
Exertion (utthana or vigorous preparation for something) is of three kinds:
(a) Exertion in self-discipline - to get initiated into
ascetic life,

After having thoroughly examined and cleaned the ground where there are no eggs (of insects), nor insects, nor seeds, nor sprouts, nor dew, nor water, nor ant-holes, nor mildew, nor marsh nor cobwebs, he should make a bed of straw on it. He should then observe the religious fast unto death called itvar ika.
ANNOTATION 106. At the time of fasting unto death, the monk should face the East, with his hands folded together and raised to the head in supplication or salutation. After paying obeisances to the Siddhas ( i.e. the Perfect Ones), he should resolve to carry out his itvar ika fast unto death. In this fast, one can move only within a restricted area. That is why, it has been termed as the itavar ika fast. Here, itvarika does not signify fast for a brief and limited period. For the annotation of the words grama, nagara etc., cf.

monk, remaining truthful ( i. e, one who faithfully carries all his vows to completion) and devoid of passions, successfully crossing the Ocean of Worldly Existence, remaining free from doubt about his ability to carry the fast through, being blessed in every possible way with the happy feeling of accomplishment, remaining unaffected by circumstances, realizing that the body is mortal, subjugating various hardships and troubles, recognizing the separateness of body and soul and experiencing the same, accomplish es (unperturbedly) this formidable (bhairava) task (of fast unto death).

It is beneficial and conducive to happiness; it is timely (i. e., justified under the circumstances) salutary (i. e., leading to beatitude) and proves to be of great assistance in the Journey Beyond.

1.
When the courageous self-disciplined and wise monks come to know that the right time for undertaking 'the fast unto death' (anasana) known as "anupurvi vimoksa or avyaghata marana) which is the last stage of uninterrupted process of sadhana ( i. e. ascetic practices), has come, they should acquaint themselves with the code of the three types of anasana viz. Bhakta -pratyakhyana, imgini marana, and prayopaga - mana) which are quite different from bala marana.
ANNOTATION 1. 'A fast unto death' undertaken for attaining Death Sublime, is of three kinds:
(a) Bhakta Pratyakhyana; (b) Ingini (Ingita) Marana; and (c) Prayopaga mana
Section five, six and seven respectively deal with these three. The fourth section lays down the conditions for viha

yo marana ( i. e. deliberately ending one's life by hanging). Fasting is of two kinds: (a) Saparakrama (undertaken when the body is
strong). (b) Aparakrama (undertaken when the body grows
weak).
Classified in another way, fasting is of two kinds:
(a) Vyaghata yukta i.e. undertaken
account of some incident.
suddenly on
(b) Avyaghata i. e. undertaken in the normal course.
While the earlier sections deal with the former kind of anasana, the present section deals with the latter one. As the avyaghata anasana is not abrupt or sudden but is achieved in serial order of development, it is also called anupurvi" (vide, the Niryukti, verse 263).
The various steps in the series of anupurvi fast are as follows:
(a) getting initiated into ascetic life; (b) studying the Scriptures; (c) learning their deeper meaning and significance; (d) after having attained efficiency in the Scripture
and their interpretations, imparting this knowledge to the deserving disciples;
(e) after having taken due permission of the Precep
tor, undertaking gradual attenuation of the body
(samlekhana); (f) then, finally, undertaking fast unto death (leading
to Death Sublime), choosing one of the above three kinds of fasts and abandoning threefold daily necessities, viz. food, implements (clothes, bowls, etc.) and lodging.

Those monks who are enlightened and proficient in religion realize that both (the external objects such as body and its daily necessities and the internal impulses and passions) are fit to be abandoned.

Such a monk attenuates (curbs) passions, curtails his diet and patiently endures (the consequences thereof). The progressive reduction of food emaciates his body and brings him almost to death.
ANNOTATION 3. In the present verse, the method of curtailment of passions and that of food respectively called bhava -samiekhana and dravya samlekhana) has been indicated.
1. Arambha: This term signifies here all those activities
such as going out abegging food and other necessities to sustain life, rendering services to fellow-ascetics and studying the scriptures, etc. undertaken to assist the practice of asceticism.

The dravya -samlekhana lasts for twelve years. According to the Uttaradhyayana (36/25-255), the order in which food can be curtailed is as follows:
The first four years - Vikrti-parityaga ( i. e. abandonment of rich food) or acamla i.e.eating only a single item of food). The next four years - Special penance such as fasting for a day, for two days for three days etc. and taking appropriate breakfast. The 9th and the 10th years Fasting on alternate days and acamla in breakfast.
The first half of the 11th year fasting for one day and two days. The second half of the 11th year - Severer penances such as fasting for three or four days or more days.
During the whole of the 11th year, the acamla in breakfast. In the first six months reduced diet on the day of acamia and a full diet on such occasions is permissible during the next six months of the 11th year.
During the 12th year - Acamla coupled with another penance, i.e. either continuous acamla or acamla with another penance alternately.
At the end of the 12th year - Fasting for a fortnight or a whole month or Bhakta Pratyakhyana, etc.
According to the Nisitha Curni,taking food is reduced in such a way that complete abandonment of food and death coincide. During the last four months of this year the mouth is kept oiled so that the speech-organs do not cease to function and there is no difficulty in reciting the Namaskara - mantra etc. (Uttarajjhyanani, vol. II, notes, pp. 263-264). 4. jiiviyN nnaabhikkhejjaa, mrnnN nnovi ptthe  /  duhtovi nn sjjejjaa, jiivite mrnne thaa  /  /

2. Nirjarapreksi: The mainstay of this equanimity is
nirjara (shedding off of the karma). A monk observing fast is always intent upon nirjara, without which he cannot remain dispassionate.
3. Samadhi: Knowledge, perception, conduct, penance, and
spiritual vigours - these five are the constituents of samadhi ( i. e. complete composure). A fasting monk must experience this five fold composure.
Pursuit of the Pure Self: The first step of spiritual pursuit is the reduction of physical activities and unattachment towards the body. This leads him to self-introspection wherein he perceives the impulses of raga and dvesa. Not perceiving the pure self, he penetrates still deeper into the innermost recesses of his soul. Ultimately, Conscient Reality (the self) in its purest and most spiritual form becomes manifest to him.

ANNOTATION 23. Desire is of two kinds:
(a) Lust for sex, and (b) Craving for pleasure.
In the present sloka, the monk has been admonished to remain unattached to both kinds of desire. At the ebb of one's life, one might be tempted to wish for specific material gain as a reward of one's penances in the form of the attainment of the highest position of glory in the next birth. But a sadhaka being desireless should refrain from such vicious aspirations.

The Rambles of Bhagavan Mahavira
1. (The Venerable Sudharma said, "O Jambu!) I shall relate to you what I have heard of the rambles of the Venerable Ascetic (Bhagavan Mahavira, the Sramana). After having discovered the Truth, the Bhagavan renounced worldly life. On getting initiated into ascetic life, (on the tenth day of the first fortnight of the lunar month of Mrgasira (corresponding to November) in winter, at Ksatriya-Kundapura (at present in Muzaffarpur District of Bihar)), the Bhagavan left immediately for ascetic wanderings.

Se parae avakahae, eyam khu anudhammiyam tassa.. (At the time of initiation, the Bhagavan had put on only one robe. He resolved:) "I shall not cover myself with this robe in winter." He was pledged to forbear the severities of cold all his life. This, in fact, comprised his anudhar ma ( i. e. way of life in harmony with his sadhana).
ANNOTATION 2. Bhagavan Mahavira was the propounder of anudharma, which has two main characteristics:
(a) non-violence, and (b) stoicism.

They tried to suck the honey (which was not there) from the body of Bhagavan Mahavira, and which fact irked them into stinging the Bhagavan's body. This went on for over four months.
ANNOTATION 3. The aroma emanating from the anointed body of Bhagavan Mahavira was very sweet and delightful. Attracted by it, many young people would come to the
d ask for various kinds of perfumaries. The Bhagavan observed a sacred silence; he would say nothing to the visitors. Displeased with him they would ruefully remark: ''What on earth is the matter with you? Why don't

you give us something ?" Another spell of silence. Annoyed with this they would maltreat him.
Unruffled by all this, the Bhagavan would stand in the posture of meditation. Womeniolk got attracted to his body which was free from the bad smell of perspiration and filth, and to his mouth which was full of sweet breath. They used to inquire: "Where do you live? Where can one find this scented stuff? Who manufactures it? But the Bhagavan's sacred silence would continue.
Thus his extra-ordinary physique plus the fragrant anointment on it became the cause of his predicament. (A caranga Curni, p. 300).

ANNOTATION 4. The purport of the text seems to be that Bhagavan Mahavira initiated himself into ascetic life with a robe on, which he later discarded. He did so on principle.
Later tradition, however, has ii that when the Bhagavan was passing by the bank of the river Suvarnabaluka, his robe got caught up in some thorny bush and was swept away by the currents of the river. A brahmin who happened to pass by, picked it up.
The supposition that the said robe could have remained intact on the Bhagavan's shoulders for thirteen months after initiation, and that the Bhagavan discarded it just when it got caught up in a thorny bush, seems irrelevant and baseless. A much more plausible theory seems to be that the Bhagavan did not put on the robe to protect himself from cold but that he did so merely to cover up the privities. As a matter of fact, this is not alien to the Nirgyantha (the Jain) tradition. This is corroborated by the

Buddhist scriptures which mention Nirgranthas clad in one single robe (ekasataka) (vide, the Anguttara Nikaya). When the Bhagavan attained the higher stages of sadhana, he completely abandoned even that piece of robe and became totally acela (naked monk). (Cf. Acaranga Curni, p. 300).

Intensely concentrating his mind on a slanting wall, the Bhagavan meditated for hours on end with his gaze firmly fixed. (The eye-balls used to bulge out, on account of the hard stare over a long period). Children used to get awe-striken by this rather unusual spectacle, and invited other children to come and watch him, with the outcry 'Goodness Gracious! Oh dear! 11

"He used to walk carefully with his eyes fixed on the path gradually widening, and of the length of a man (roughly six feet). Shocked at the spectale of the Bhagavan's walking with his gaze fixed, children used to raise a hue and cry and attracted the other boys to it. Dr. Herman Jacobi, who has translated this sutra on the basis of the explanation given by the commentator, has, however, mooted this point: "I cannot make out the exact meaning of it, perhaps, so that he was a wall for the animals.
"
11
Fixing the gaze on the wall has been the meditational technique of the Buddhist monks also. In the present text of Ayaro itself (2/125), we find that this very technique of meditation has been mentioned. The commentator of the Bhagawati Sutra, Shri Abhayadeva Suri has also interpreted the word tiryagbhitti as the rampart (prakara), or the wall of a mound, or the

But this seclusion was often nvaded by womenfolk who happened to pass that way (in search of solitude). (Although solicited by women for carnal enjoyment), the Bhagavan would spurn their advances, for he was all the time morally alert. Penetrating into the depths of his soul, he would go in meditation on such an occasion.

Bhagavan Mahavira meditated with deep concentration even in the midst of places crowded with householders. He would not speak even when spoken to. If someone compelled him to speak, he would quietly move to some other place. He would not let his concentration be disturbed in any way and would remain equipoised in all situations.
ANNOTATIONS 6-7. The Bhagavan would choose a secluded place for meditation. If he did not get one, he would seclude himself - i. e. he would shut himself out from all extraneous circumstances and get himself immersed deeply in the very depths of the innermost soul. To look for a secluded place, or (if such a place is not easily available) to seclude oneself from all external objects, is very useful and advantageous for meditation.

The Bhagavan would turn a deaf ear to harsh words and unbearable insults. He kept himself vigorously engrossed in spiritual pursuits. He would take no interest in graphic narratives, colourful plays, songs, cudgel-fights and boxing (and such other entertainments).
ANNOTATION I. Bhagavan Mahavira would forbear both kinds of rigours or hardships, favourable and unfavourable. A musician was playing on a lute (vina). On seeing the Bhagavani who happened to pass that way at that time, he said, "My Bhagavan! Please stop to hear my performance." But Bhugavan Mahavira politely refused, and quietly went away. To evince interest in any kind of entertainment colourful or euphonious, is a kind of tempting predicament for a sadhaka.

The Bhagavan lived home-life for more than two years (after the death of his parents). During that period, he did not take any animate food or water. Even though he lived with the members of his family, his soul was solitary. His body, mind, speech and senses - everything remained untainted. He always perceived Truth and kept constant company with Peace. (After this sadhana in the midst of his family), he renounced home-life.
ANNOTATION 11. Bhagavan Mahavira was 28 years old, when his parents died. He expressed his desire to embrace asceticism at once. At that time his elder brother Nandivardhana and other relatives of his requested the Bhagavan, "Oh my dear Prince! please, do not add insult to injury by saying so, You know fully well that our parents are no more, and on top of this you too want to leave the family." Bearing this entreaty in mind, Bhagavan Mahavira thought to himself, "If I took to initiation now I may cause sadness to many people and this may make them miserable. Some people in the family might even commit suicide. This is not desirable. "

Relenting, he said, "Please tell me how long I should remain with you?" Nandivardhana answered, "The death of the king and the queen will be mourned for two years, for which period you must live with us." The Bhagavan acceded to his request. The Bhagavan said, "You must however accede to a request of mine as well. I must have my own choice in matters of food etc. No one should interfere with me. If these terms are acceptable to you, then alone I can stay in this home for two years." Nandivardhana and thers agreed to this.
During this period, the Bhagavan did not take any animate food or drink. He would wash his hands and feet with inanimate water, but never take a full bath. He led a life of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, continence and nonacquisitiveness. He did not take meals at night. He remained totally unattached to his family. This was an experiment in asceticism in the midst of the homelife.

Bhagavan Mahavira repudiated this general belief and established the principle of the possibility of rebirth in any genus. According to this, the variety of karma causes change of genera in rebirth.

through sensuality, violence, and the impulses of mind, speech, and body, the sage and wise Bhagavan propounded the unique doctrine of kriya, not propounded by others.
ANNOTATION 16. When the Bhagavan was leading a dispassionate and detached life even in the midst of home-life, his uncle named Suparsva, his elder brother named Nandivardhana, and some other friends, said to him, "Why don't you enjoy sensual pleasures ?
The Bhagavan answered, "The senses are the sources of the influx of kar mic matter. My soul is pining for emancipation. That is why I can't enjoy the sensual pleasures.
On hearing this, they said, "O Prince! why don't you drink cold (animate) water and eat animate food?"
The Bhagavan replied, "Violence is the source of bondage. My soul is pining for freedom. That is why I refrain from killing beings (with water-body), possessed of life like me."
They again said, "Oh Prince! you keep continously sitting in the posture of meditation. Why do you not have some recreation?"
The Bhagavan quipped back, "The mind, body and speech are also the triple sources of bondage. My soul is pining for freedom. I refrain, therefore, from giving support to their impulses."
They said, "Why don't you take bath? Why do you sleep on the floor?"
The Bhagavan said, "The bodily attachment and luxuries are both sources of bondage. I want to plug these loopholes. That is why I have embraced this way of life."

Another interpretation is that the Bhagavan did not take any meat or alcoholic drinks (papaka).
Yet another interpretation is that the Bhagavan did not partake of such meals which were conducive to sinfulness.

He did not go for alms to any such feast which could not feed people beyond the numbers of invitees.
He did not even think of delicious food.
ANNOTATION 19. According to the author of Curni, Bhagavan Mahavira had only one robe on at the time of initiation, which he had abandoned after thirteen months. He never used any other robe ever since.
When he broke the fast just after initiation into asceticism, the Bhagavan took his meals in a utensil owned by a householder. Later he became a panipatra (i. e. one who uses the palms of his hand as utensils), and never used the utensils of anyone for taking his meals.
Once when the Bhagavan was sojourning in a weaver's workshop at Nalanda, his only disciple called Gosalaka asked him, "Shall I bring some food for you?" The Bhagawan said, "No", in the belief that his disciple would get food for him in a householder's utensil.
After he achieved ominiscience the Bhagavan became a Tirthankara. Loharya, one of his disciples, used to procure food for him from householders. But the Bhagavan would take it on his palms and then eat it. The description alluded to here refers to the period of sadhana. Therefore, the incident of procurement of food by Loharya is not purported here.

A glutton cannot wholeheartedly concentrate on meditation. That is why the Bhagavan. took only a frugal diet.
Even while leading family life, Bhagavan Mahavira was not at all keen on (any delicacies of) food. Right from the very beginning he was not interested in such food. And this disinterestedness reached its culmination during the period of his sadhana.
The Bhagavan would never long for a particular kind of food except when undertaking special sadhana e.g. he would sometimes wish foruradafor carrying on specific sadhana.
Bhagavan Mahavira had a steady gaze; he would not let his eyes blink. If a particle of dust accidentally fell into his eyes, he would not care to take it out. In case of an ant or a mosquito or any other insect biting him, he would not even scratch his body. All this he did for successful control in sadhana.

(When Bhagavan Mahavira meditated in solitude, ) some tramps would try to disturb him by embarassing questions (like these "Who are you? Where have you come from? What makes you stand here?") or some times at night, some debauchees would accost him thus ("'What are you doing here in this deserted house?"}
On getting no answer from the Bhagavan, they would get annoyed with him and would start maltreating him.
Nevertheless, the Bhagavan would remain rapt in meditation. He would not even think of retaliating.

Bhagavan Mahavira's Endurance of Hardships
1.
Bhagavan Mahavira bore with equipoise various kinds of hardships, including being pricked by the grass (typical of the Ladha country-side) the extremities of the weather, and bites of gad-flies and mosquitoes.
ANNOTATION 1. During the period of sadhana Bhagavan Mahavira once paid a visit to the Ladha countryside (i.e. the districts of Tamulaka, Midnapur, Hugli and Burdvan in West Bengal) which abounded in prickly grass. Very often, this proved to be the cause of sharp bodily pain. The area in which this kind of grass luxuriously grew was also surrounded with mountains, which added to the cold atmosphere there.
The Bhagavan would also cheerfully bear the heat of the sun. In a place like Halduga, he had to put up with scorching and almost burning temperatures.

The Ladha teemed with vicious creatures like gad-flies, mosquitoes, and leeches. Despite knowledge of all these untoward conditions, the Bhagavan. went there to test himself on the touchstone of equanimity. p. 377 577-16T10, qui a T (FE?) all _ pNtN sejjN sevisu, aasnngaanni cev pNtaaii  //  2.

serable lodgings and poor seats. ANNOTATION 2. The Lad ha countryside was terribly inaccessible because of mountains and thick forest. Nevertheless, Bhagavan. Mahavira went there. He managed to get only desolate and dilapidated houses to live in, and rough wooden planks or boards to sit on and those too covered with thick layers of dust, soil and cowdung. All this, however, could not disturb the evenness of the Bhagavan's mind.

3.
ANNOTATION 3. There were no towns and cities in the districts of Vajra and Sumha of the Ladha.. There was a dearth of such things as sesamum seeds, from which oil could be produced, or of good cows from which butter could be produced. Consequently, the inhabitants of that place

took only insipid, totally fatless food. This sort of foodhabit led to their being ill-tempered. Anger, vituperative tongue, and assault were almost habit with them. They used to cover their bodies with grass.
The Bhagavan used to take a single meal only at midday. In Ladha, the Bhagavan would get only rice soaked in water, urada (a kind of pulse)-soup or sour-soup, but all without salt.
The dogs of that place were so fierce that people had to use sticks and cudgels to ward them off. Since the Bhagavan was unarmed, the dogs would frequently and easily attack him.

ANNOTATION 12. Not all people inhabiting the Ladha countryside were ill-tempered; there were, however, some good-natured people there as well. There were those who were very impulsive. These would remove the Bhagavan from his seat. Even so the Bhagavan would not be displeased. Seeing that he maintained a sweet evenness of temper, their hearts would change, and they would apologise to him for their nonchalant insolence.

Although untouched by illness, Phagavan Mahavira would still have a curtailed diet. Whether afflicted or not, he would not approve of medication for himself.
ANNOTATION 1. Man by nature is prone to gluttony. It is not easy to eat sparingly. There are some who do eat little, but they do so only under compulsion, i.e. when they are afflicted with a disease, and wish to get rid of it. Bhagavan Mahavira had no disease or ailment, yet he would eat sparingly and with long intervals just like a serpent.
Illnesses are of two kinds: (a) Internal, i. e, due to a disturbance of humours of
deficiency of vitamins, and (b) External, i.e. injuries caused by accidents, etc.

The Bhagavan abandoned all sorts of purgatives, emetics, unguents, bathing, shampooing or even cleaning of the teeth.
ANNOTATION 2. Soon after initiation into ascetic life, Bhagavan Mahavira had taken up a vow: "I will lead a life of self-abnegation by abandoning all bodily care." In accordance with this vow, he would refrain from any physical beautification, or any extra care of the body. It is imperative for a sadhaka to forget all about his body and concern himself with complete dedication to the soul. The above routine followed by Bhagavan Mahavira refers to this.
