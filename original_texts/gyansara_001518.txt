ABOUT THE AUTHOR A spiritually awakened genius, Shri Upadhyayaji Yashovijayaji, would more aptly be termed a human phenomenon that occurred three-hundred years before, to apply a healing touch to the troubled Svetamber Jain Sect of Western India. In a life-time of prodigious creative activity, volume after volume of literary value, discovered so far, forms a vast collection composed in Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi and Gujarati, covering a whole gamut of subjects and topics from Agamas, second to none in quality and the depth of knowledge, despite many constraints of the austere life of a Jain Muni. He joined the hallowed rank of Acharyas as one of the torch-bearers, whose prime mission was to dispel darkness of ignorance and light the lamps of knowledge.
Probably witnessing the plight of the society, riven by the sectarian differences of the orthodoxy, fall in the moral standards that strengthened the stronghold of pseudo-monks Yatis, who thrived on the ignorance of the masses and preachings of false dogmas and attacks by vehement critics, hailing from other persuasions and philosophical systems, a deep compassion aroused the contemplative recluse transforming him into a human dynamo.
He found ignorance as the root cause of moral degradation. In order to remove this, he composed simple literary treatises that a common man could understand. He wrote extensively on philosophy, logic and grammar, perceiving them as vital areas requiring fresh approach to bring them up in conformity with changing literary trends. Inspired to preserve the precious heritage, he wrote on yoga and adhyatma. These writings are acclaimed as classic on the subjects.
He boldly stood up against untruth and injustice notwihtstanding harrassments from those against whom his powerful voice was raised.
This Publication embodying the wisdom of a luminary whose accomplishments are a legend is presented as an humble tribute to him.

LIFE SKETCH OF
SHETH SHRI AMRITLAL KALIDAS DOSHI
The life and activities of Sheth Shri Amritlal Kalidas Doshi can be summed aptly in the classic words of Mathew Arnold "Sweetness and Light".
Born in a village near Jamnagar in an era of economic stagnation and political darkness on 14-10-1894, he breathed his last on the 7th January 1977 in the metropolis of Bombay in an altogether different era of a maturing economy and politically independent India. These 83 years
of life, he filled in with several achievements. Self-effacing like the proverbial ripe fruit hidden by leaves, nevertheless his achievements were outstanding, claiming admiration and appreciation from his fellowmen. He lived a full life with wordly achievements in the sphere of business and industry, scholarly attainments, playing outstanding role in the service of the Jain Community and the public at large and carrying out philanthropic and religious activities.
He was an illustrious son of a noble father, Shri Kalidas Virji Doshi. Shri Kalidas who set a living example of Humility, Charity and Piety which the son tried to emulate to the best of his abilities. He graduated from the Bahauddin College in Junagadh in 1917, when graduation was a hallmark of personal achievement. He had attained proficiency in both English and Sanskrit. Scholarly by nature, he could freely quote from Shakespeare, Milton and Bible. The death of his father a few months before he graduated, brought on his young shoulders a tremendous burden of supporting a large family.

Braving personal hardships, he looked after the whole family during difficult times. He came down to Bombay in 1917 and took up a job in a Paint Manufacturing Company. By 1924, his sincerity, talents and capacity for hardwork got him an offer of a partnership in a firm trading in Dyes and known as “B. Shivchand Jethalal & Co." As business expanded, he set himself to transforming it into a Business House of repute with a wide net-work of distribution system. This fine organisation that he built up is known for its integrity and excellence and bears testimonial to the farsightedness and tireless efforts which he brought to bear upon the task,
When fortune smiled upon him, he welcomed it as an opportunity for serving the religious and charitable causes so dear to him. In 1942, he constructed a Jain Temple “Gandhar Mandir" at Palitana in memory of his father and plunged into public life for serving the community. In 1952, he presided over the Golden Jubilee Sessior All-India Svetamber Jain Murtipujak Conference. In 1966, he presided over the Session of Bharatiya Jain Mahamandal which passed the historic resolution of celebrating 2500th Nirwan Mahotsava of Bhagwan Mahavir. He was a trustee of Anandji Kalyanji and Naminathji Temple for many years. He presided over many functions and supported many a just cause.
He was a fine orator and it was a treat to hear him both in Gujarati and English. As his association in public life grew, he came to be recognised as a Leader of the Community for his scholarly attainments, great power of persuasion and patience and the skill he showed in tackling the delicate issues. Whatever task he undertook, big or small, he did not spare himself in completing it. He was a perfectionist and looked into minute details with meticulous care.
Several charitable trusts and institutions fulfilling

diverse pubilc needs owe their origin and derive their inspiration from him. He was instrumental in disbursing huge sums for public welfare activities such as famine and drought relief, earthquake relief, education to the poor and relief to the needy and for setting up the D.K.V. Arts & Science College at Jamnagar and in contributing to such institutions liberally. He could not turn away any one from his door and would not be content till he did what he could for bringing relief to the needy and the suffering. Bharatiya Vidya Bhayan received a large sum of Rs. 10 lakhs for diverse activities that it carries on in the field of arts, culture and literature.
He had a passion for knowledge and self-realisation. He set up Jain Sahitya Vikas Mandal at Vile-Parle in the year 1948, to study Jainology critically to interpret ancient texts and scriptures and communicate the eternal message embodied in them, to all for rediscovering the meaning of life and to show how it can be used in facing practical problems of life. The institute, during its career of 38 years, has published 42 volumes based on critical study of all the available literature on the subjects chosen. He would not rest till he was convinced that the meaning of the scriptural texts was determined and the underlying philosophical background was expounded fully in conformity with Jain Tenets. He took scrupulous care to cite the original source and recognised authorities in support of the interpretations and explanations of the text. The research volumes published in Gujarati, Hindi and English dealt with Jain Philosophy, Yoga, Logic and meditation. The excellence and the outstanding quality of these works is widely acclaimed. They will really be a true monument to this great soul.
When he retired in 1964, probably he hoped for a quiet and peaceful life. Unfortunately failing health and advancing age claimed its toll. He had to face many a crisis with increasing frequency till the end which came

on 7th January 1977. Prepared as he was through meditation and deep studies in religion, he accepted the suffering with a detached mind. He retained all the faculties of mind till the end.
He retained a dignified demeanour, sense of humour and liveliness till the end. As the end drew near, he called upon his secret reserves of strength and rose to the occasion. Conscious of the approaching death, he met it gracefully. He gathered all the family members and asked for their forgiveness, and blessed the children.
He was indeed a true representative of the Indian tradition, one who lived up to the Jain principle of life "PARASPAROPAGRAHO JĪVĀNĀM (Live with Others and Live for Others)".

PUBLISHER'S NOTE
We have witnessed emergence of a new class of English reading people, who increasingly turn to English for drawing knowledge of their own national heritage, thus lending greater importance to translations of scriptural texts of acknowledged excellence as a source material.
We have the pleasure of putting into the hands of the readers, our Fourth Publication JÑĀNASARA' Thought Gems of knowledge, composed by an extraordinary Genius Śrī Mahopädyāya Yaśovijayajī, who flourished in the 17th Century. We undertook this work to present profound knowledge of universal appeal as a fount that fed the streams of Jain Scriptural knowledge. He boldly sought to ovecome sectarian differences and thus became a contributor in the process of synthesis of Philosophies that was initiated in the 7th Century, by Śrī Ācārya Haribhadra Sūri.
The quality of excellence that informs JÑANASĀRA' has rightly drawn attention of scholars. Translations available in different languages are found to be useful in appreciation of the literary quality of original and form an important source on interpretations of the text.
Dr. Amritlal Gopani belong to a band of a few select Scholars in oriental literature, who have mastered the art of translation of Sanskrit texts into English. We are indeed indebted to him for affording us this

opportunity of publishing this translation, which was for him a labour of love, for the friendship that he deeply cherished and for fostering within himself a mood of quiet comtemplation, which perhaps was a noble intention of the original Author to create in the reader.
Our thanks are due to Pt. Girishkumar Parmanand Shah for doing transliteration and providing Slokasūcī and indexes. This certainly enhances the usefulness of the Book.
If the reader profits from this work and his interest is enkindled in Jain Works of Philosophy and Literature, we will feel more than amply rewarded.

PRE FACE
Since 1945 I intimately knew the late Shri A. K. Doshi, wellknown industrialist and Founder President of Jain Sahitya Vikas Mandal (JS VM) at Vile Parle (West).
Very often he had requested me to undertake some work for publication in the said JSVM Series but it never materialized. A day before his death I happened to go to him to enquire of his health as he was ailing and was literally bed-ridden. Little did we both know then that life that was spared for him was only for a day more. The same topic of my undertaking some work was opened by him. Just to please him, I expressed my desire to undertake translation into Gujarati of the “ Jain Moral Doctrine" by H. S. Bhattacharya.
But somehow I could not find the undertaking interesting and thus dropped the idea. A few years after Amritlalbhai's sad and sudden demise, when Shri Chandrakantbhai the worthy son of a worthy father and the present managing trustee again opened the same subject and I immediately offered him to take up the Jnanasara of Mahopadhyaya Yashovijayaji, which I was preparing along with Gunapala's Jambucariyam as an awardee of the University Grants Commission. He whole-heartedly consented and the result is now before the reader.
In the preparation of this book I have copiously drawn on the two excellent editions of Jnanasara (V. S. 1997) one by Pandit Bhagvandas Harakhchand and the other by Munishri Bhadraguptavijayaji (V. S. 2033).
Despite the constraints of a fragile health, I have tried my best to make the readering as flawless as possible keeping in view specially the English-knowiog people. This has forced me to avoid the technicalities as far as possible. It was my earnest desire from the very outset to present it in such a simple way that the reader who does not know any language other than English can thereby profit. It is for those readers to say how far I have succeeded.

I shall never forget the immense and invaluable help given by my trusted friend, Pandit Girishkumar Parmanand Shah who himself is a deep Scholar of Jainism. It is he who has prepared the transliteration, Indexes, Sloka-suci etc., etc. For this and for seeing the book through the Press, all my thanks are due to him.
And finally, how can I finish this preface without whole heartedly thanking Shri Chandrakantbhai, the ever-smiling and ever-forgiving managing trustee of the JSVM ? That's all.
Amritial Gopani.

INTRODUCTION
No absolutely reliable information about the life and work of Mahopadhyaya Yashovijayji, the author is available. However, I have utilized the whole material published so far, in preparing this outline and that material has now been accepted as truely and as almost final.
Our author was born in the village, Kanoda, also referred to as Kanhoda which lay between Kalol and Patan in the then Baroda District.
He was the eldest son of Narayanadas by Saubhagyadevi, his younger brother being Padmasinha, His own name was Jasvant. His mother, who was a devoted lady, used to go to Shri Nayavija ya ji to pay respect to him and to hear his religious sermons, taking her two sons with her. When Nayavijayji once happened to come to Kanoda in V. S. 1688, after the completion of his monsoon stay in Kunaghar near Patan in V. S. 1687. In Kanoda itself both brothers were consecrated into the Monk's order in the same year and were named as Yashovijayji and Padmavijayji respectively.
Finding Yashovijayji extremely intelligent and enthusiastic in learning. Nayavijayji, at the request and insistence of Shri Dhanaji Sheth of Ahmedabad, took him to Banaras, the best place where ample facility and convenience for the deep and compa rative study of the six non-jain Philosophical systems existed Guru took this step in order to enable Yashovijayji to evaluate Jain philosophy so far as its essence and place of importance are concerned in the context of other philosopbical systems.
Ag hinted before, Yashovijayji, who was of keen intellect, took no time in mastering the philosophical systems which are broadly divided into two categories, Prachin and Navya. At Banaras, Yashovijayji attended seminars in which many bearned Pandits drawn from all over the country took part for discussions. This gave him an opportunity to train himself in how best to make practical use of the vast knowledge that he had gained. Once, he defeated all the participating Pandits in one of such assemblies and to their chagrin established himself as the supreme debater of proven skill and ability. As a mark of appreciation, he was awarded here the designation of Nyayavisharad.

Having obtained what was worth obtaining in the twin fields. of logic and philosophy, the Guru Nayavijayji who had spared no pains in equipping his brilliant pupil. Yashovijayji's with the vast armoury of knowledge and information shifted headquarters from Banaras to Agra, where he stayed for four years and perfected his form and shape as a scholar. At the same time enriching his already enormous treasure of learning growing up as a great intellectual with penetrating logic and reasoning mastering the tenets and principles promulgated by one Banarasidas, which were approximately similar to those of the Digambara sect.
In course of his peregrinations, Nayavijayji with Yashovijayji arrived at Ahmedabad, the exalted seat of Jainism. Here also Yashovijayji lost no time in popularizing himself amongst reputed scholars and in spreading the lustre of his learning everywhere. Mahobbatkhan was the Suba of Ahmedabad. He came to hear about the exceptional ability of young Yashovijayji in logic, metaphysics and philosophy and invited him to the royal assembly to enlighten the members of the royal court. Yashovijayji, with the consent of the Guru, obliged the Suba by accepting the invitation which was sent to him with extra-ordinary respect and humility. Here Yashovijayji performed eighteen Avadhans (Avadhans. is a teachnical term used for that intellectual gift through which one is able to remember number of things told seperately by each one in succession may be by eighteen or even more persons and then to attend to them all) properly one by one, beginning from the first person. This feat is possible only if a man is endowed with flawless memory. Seeing this splendid exercise of Yashovijayji, the countiers were dumbfounded. Almost all, not only became his admirers, but even the followers of Jainism, The common belief held by people at large then that there is no sound scholar amongst the Jains was thus prvoed a myth by Yashovijayji. Jainism was thus enthroned on a pedestal and people took pride in adopting it. In Ahmedabad Yashovijayji's excellent qualities of bead and heart were acknowledged and duly appre--- ciated with the designation of Upadhyaya conferred on bim by Vijayadevsuri. He had already been Nyaya Visharada and Naya... carya-the titles earned by him at Banaras in view of his having authored bundred of books 'on Nyaya: .

Yashovijayji died in V. S. 1743, at historic Dabhoi (the modern name for the ancient Darbhavati) in Baroda district where Viradhaval-I was once the reigning king. He stoically embraced death as the successful termination of the religious vow to fast upto death undertaken by him.
No further details about the life of Yasliovijayji are available. We have to be satisfied with meagre information that has been given above. But what has been stated is adequate enough to indicate that his was the work of deep ard comprehensive erudition. His knowledge was immense and well--assimilated. He was a prolific writer who gave us as many as hundred books. He was therefore by a common consent the last luminary, in the whole galaxy who earned his place along with great personages like Haribhadrasuri and Hamachandrasuri.
Adhyatmamatapriksha, Adhyatmasara, Adryatmopanishad, Anekan tavyavastha, Jaina Tarka Paribhasa, Gurutattvanischaya, Dwatrinshaddwatrinshika, Yatilak shana Samuchhaya, Naya rahasya, Nayapradipa, Nayopadesha, Jnanabindu, Nayaloka. Jnanasira, Vidhivada etc etc. are some of the published works of Yashovijayji. A mere glance at those is sufficient to prove that he had unrivalled genius which shed light on such topics as metaphysics, logic, philosophy, spiritualism, ethics, ritualism etc. etc. Many of his works, still remain unpublished. If and when they are brought to light they will furnish additional evidence of his massive genius and incomparable intelligence. Not merely in Sanskrit but in Prakrit, Apabhrams'a, and old Gujarati also, he employed his pen to write, his stavanas and sajjhayas are unexcelled even today in point of elegance and being instructive in nature.
JNANASARA In all the works of Yashovijayji, Jnanasara is at the top as the author has put in the whole essence of all he knew, felt and experienced. It is thus a master key unlocking the entire treasure of spiritualism as conceived and practised by him. It is a light house - the helping and guiding light of which one can steer. clear of the rocks of doubts obstructing and delaying the aspirants orward march to spiritual growth and development.******

Jnanasara is constituted of thirty two topics covering the whole range of spiritualism, each of which is briefly but exhaus. tively described in eight slokas in easy and forceful Sanskrit which even a layman can understand and interprete. It is at once simple and substantial. The infinite potenliality and power of the soul is presented to the aspirant in fine expressions, statements and conclusions. Its terseness is edifying, not obscuring. Its phrases are apt, not ornamental, Its style is direct, not tortuous. A Jain and non-Jain can equally profit, as there is no sectarian colour given to it. To say that it can be like Gita for Hindus and the Bible for the Christians and the Grantha Sahib of the Sikhs is no exageration but is to bring out the universality of the message. It can be carried in a pocket, read in the trains, planes and buses, consulated when in doubt and disappointment and memorized without taxing the memory. It is an epitome of
self-realization, a digest of the ethical code prescribing what an · apprentice should do and prohibiting that which he should not
do. It should be daily recited as many times as possible. It is both a source book and reference book.
It is composed mainly keeping the nouminal point of view in front. The first Astaka States describing the goal (Purnataperfection) and the rest describing the means succintly narrated in the Astakas each of which that succeeds follows from the preceding. There is nothing controversial and nothing ambigous. It is straight in its appeal and matter-of-fact in shape and substance. There are more than one commentaries each of which is quite distinct in its approach but not at all contradictory. It is no doubt a matter of pride and pleasure that it enjoys such a wide acceptability and universality amongst the Jain Sadhus and Scholars, but is also a measure of its quality and of a success of rising above sectarian approach in its search for the Truth in consonance with the premises on which Jainism rests.
Tae first Astakı sets forth the goal of perfection. In the remaioing Astakas, the factors and instruments responsible for its achievement are narrated in brief. Each Astaka is a logical corollary of the previous one. Therefore, the second briefly relates to selfabsorption, the third, to stability of Mind, the fourth to Avoidance

Scripntres, Possession Experience, Yoga, Sacrifice, worship, Meditation. Penance, and Lastly Synthesis of all view-points.
It will not be clear that the author has confined the first Astaka to declaring the only objective, summum bonum of the human being. It is perfection (a) To ascend to this highest. level, the author has conceived thirtyone steps, the second being self-absorption.
Just as perfection is not possible without Self-Absorption this self-Absorption also is not possible without Stability of Mind and so on and so forth. And thus, we come to the last one which is the Synthesis of All View-points. In other words, this also means that the succeeding Astaka lays down the effect. and the preceding, the cause. We can also say that all the Astakas,. are in a way, a chain of causes and effects, the ultimate effect. or say the result being perfection. Just said before, perfection is the climax, the summit resulting from self-absorption which again. arises out of stability or Firmness of Mind and so and so forth coming down to Synthesis of all the view-points which is the prime cause.
Now if we begin from this first and fundamental cause(Synthesis of All View-Points) and go up-wards, we will come to Penance which is its effect and so and an so forth. We ultimately come to Perfection (qofar) which is the final result. In this. way, all the Astakas are interrelated, interlocked so to say.
Perfection, Fulness, Total Integration of self is the final goal. of an aspirant should try to realise. But this can only be done if a person becomes Self-absorbed. In fact, Perfection and Self-Absor ption are but the two sides of the same coin. So long as the mind is wavering, there can be no merging in the self. Therefore, the mind should be stable. There are many tempations in the world

- and the mind is caught up in the Snares of delusion. So the mind should be extricated from these snares and then only it can become firm. A person should first have real knowledge of the Reality. This will help him in weighing the pros and cons and thus he will be able to assess the value of every thing in a right perspective. As a result, delusion will disappear and the mind will become balanced. The ground shouid be cleared for the knowledge, by divesting the intellect of its usual weakness, the weakness of becoming disturbed off and on provocation. If tranquility of mind is ensured, knowledge will, indeed, follow. The victory over sense organ is a causative factor for renunciation which itself is responsible for religious activity. Satiety, nongre. ediness or disirelessness will follow one by one from the religious activity. This will ripen into accepting monkhood, which is dependent on the scriptural knowledge, discrimination and neutrality. All this is the outcome of fearlessness, avoidance of self-praise and philosophical insight. This last, that is to say, the philosphical insight is due to one's aversion to worldly existence, avoidance of world-consciousness and comprehensive and deep study of the religious scriptures. This can never be ensured without the acquisition of yoga, worship, meditation and penance. Ultimately, all encompassing Synthetical view to glimpse the Real is the prime cause, basic cause, fundamental ingredient of the spiritual formula which is offered here in the Jnanasara by the author. As same light shines through all the facets of a jewel, each view point is a pointer to some aspect of the reality. All aspects are equally important and when combined in an all embracing vision reveal the glory of one reality. Yashovijayji Maharaja who rules supreme as a savant, Sadhu and saviour of the spiritually ailing humanity. The corrective recipe given in it is true for all times and climes.
There is another view--point also regarding interpretation, each of the Astakas, excepting first which states the aim and objective of a person, can be understood as an independent unit without bothering whether it is interlinked or not. Each Astaka has something to say to us and if we accept that, it will help us in our onward march to perfection. When the precept, the advice, the exhortation contained in one Astaka is listened to and acted

upon, it is able to illumine our path and take us nearer our goal, one can surmise what a marvellous result it will produce if the contents of all the Astaka are attended to and acted upon. We can take up any, as for example, stability of mind, knowledge, Discrimination etc., etc., and put it into practice, the benefit will be ours,
These Astakas, apart from their being repository of wisdom, abode of soul lifting instructions and inspring directives, are the best specimens of Yashovijayji's poetic genius. It is more difficult to poetize philosophy than to philosophize poetry. Our author has achieved this art. It is more difficult to epitomize than to enlarge. Our author has achieved this art. You simply cannot change the Syntax; you simply cannot use more forceful contruction, you simply cannot employ a more appealing style, you caonot be more economical in the use of words. Our author is all this and much more. Deep koowledge of the scriptures, profound thinking, razor-sharp argumentative power, brilliant cxposition, absolutely unambiguous statements, devotional attitude, unshakeable faith, clear vision and synthetical approach are simply our author's and only our author's. Therefore, Jnanasara seems to be the work he wrote when his genius had become blooming and his experience mature. He is by common consent the last of the whole galaxy of Jain luminaries.
We bow down to him with feelings of wonderment:
AMRITLAL GOPANI.

paroktamupapadyate 11711 116311 Meaning : One who has accomplished partial renunciation by partially stopping threefold activity (through suppression and annihilation) should ultimately stop completely the threefold activity. It is in this way only that an unqualified Brahma, referred to in other schools of thought, is realized. (7) [63]
Notes : il means employment or activity. It is threefold, e.g., मानसिक, वाचिक and कायिक. It is advocated here in this stanza to give up all activities and attain the status of the Brahma which is unqualified as described in the non-Jain schools of thought. (7) [63]

Notes : FICHT is one who has completely abandoned all the threefold activities. It is a compound word qualifyiag the word art. (8) [64]

Meaning: He who has knowledge, is intent on doing religious activities, has developed the power to partially suppress and destroy the karmas, has invested his soul with capacity and has brought under control his sense-organs, has crossed the worldly ocean and is able to inspire others also to cross it. (1) [65] also. Mere knowledge by itself is useless. All the four qualifications make a perfect ; therefore, they all are necessary. (1) [65] क्रियाविरहितं हन्त ! ज्ञानमात्रमनर्थकम् ।

Notes: A traveller having simply the knowledge of the road leading to destination cannot reach it if at all he makes no movement. Therefore, ara without fis not merely useless but positively harmful. (2) [66]

tailapūrtyādikam yathā 11311 116711 Meaning : Even one who has got total knowledge, expects, at times, (to do) activity, agreeable to himself, just as a lamp, though self-luminous, requires to be reinforced with oil etc. (3) [67]
Notes : So long as one has not scaled the highest heights of perfection, he has to do, on some occasions, activities which are spotless and pure. Here, 347 means agreeable no doubt ut at the same time also means "sanctioned by scriptures.” On the eighth step of the Spiritual Ladder ( ITF2TF) one does
meditation which is notliing but the क्रिया. cf. तत्राष्टमे गुणस्थाने, J4CITATICE 17TİF AYNE Fa:ll (ITF417 FARIE)(3)[67]

Notes : Usually advanced reason that it is a alaar is no reason at all. It is a pretense. Any rites, rituals and ceremonies, if they are at all purificatory, they have a place in the scheme of the scriptures, (4) [68]

Meaning One should perform religious activity either for increasing spiritual potentiality or for saving himself from degradation In the case of jinas only, self-control is permanent. (7) [71]
Notes: self-control stays permanently in Jinas, the perfect ones only. In others, it goes and comes. Therefore, good activity has a legitimate place and is an advantage in as much as it increases spiritual potential or saves one from taking a fall fagà means

प्रत्युत प्रोल्लसच्छक्तिभूय एवोपवर्धते ॥ The same thing is also reflected in this line also :
" विषयेषु प्रवृत्तानां वैराग्यः खलु दुर्लभम् ” (7) [79] सुखिनो विषयातृप्ता नेन्द्रोपेन्द्र दयोऽप्यहो। भिक्षुरेका सुखी लोके ज्ञानतृप्तो निरजनः ॥८॥ ॥८॥ sukhino visayatrita

Notes : Compare the following stzs. of Svamı Umāsvāti which describe the eternally happy man :

Notes : It is necessary that one who has taken a plunge in the self and who is totally unsoiled, should every moment keep away the thought that he is besmeared and this he can do by performing religious activities. or we can interpret this stanza differently also. A person, who does religious activities should think that he is not at all affected by the effect of the deeds-good or bad, because the soul is by nature, pure and simple.

Notes : Dignity, superiority, and renown will no doubt come antomatically to him who has no desires; but he should beware and make it a point not to make an exhibition of it, because that desirelessness will itself become the cause of his fall. sifago does not here mean virtuousness because of his caste or community. It simply means virtuousness which is ingrained in the desireless. (6) [94]

Notes : There are two Nayas (View points), namely, ज्ञाननय and क्रियानय. The meditating monk has knowledge and faith both as also the conduct because while meditating, he does the activity also in the form of meditation.

Notes : What is the use in mere having a thing unless one knows nothing about how to make use of it? It is advocated here in this stanza that knowledge should be implemented by actual action. One should have all the three, namely, Faith, Knowledge and Conduct. (4) [ 100 ]

Notes : The monk knows the lust for the world (worldly pleasures ) to be as equal to as the fat appearance due to (a disease of) swelling or to decorating a man about to be slaughtered.

Notes The lamp sheds its light above, below and around. The light becomes weak or strong on occasions; but the light is thrown by the lamp, no doubt. In the same way if the monk puts his monkhood to use with regard to soul only, and not with regard to the non-soul; his monkhood is supreme, superior. (8) [104]

Meaning It is the greatest delusion of a stupid man that he thinks that he is able to render pure by water the body, which is produced out of dirtiness and is able to render impure what is pure. (4) [108 ].
Notes: To take the body which by itself is impure and which makes that impure which comes into its contact, as pure is sheer stupidity. How can you expect good from such a body even if you bathe it with litres and litres of water ? Compare the following Śloka occurring in भवभावना : सुवकं पिउणो माऊए सोणियं तदुभयं पि संसों तप्पढमाए जीवो आहारइ तत्थ उप्पन्नो । ( 4 ) [ 108 ]

Meaning: The inner conscience of that person is extremely pure who does not become impure again having bathed in the reservoire of equanimity and having removed the dirt of sin. (5) [109]
Notes: Then only the body becomes clean and pure, the author observes, when it is bathed in the pond of holy water of equanimity and is thus stripped of dirt in the form of sin. This is the only method and right method, too, to purge it of impurities. Every thing else is an exercise in futility, the author announaces his final opinion.

This type of snare, therefore, is extraordinary. By identifying the soul with the nonsoul, the soul itself is involved in a new snare. (6) [110]

* Central Idea * faa#: (Vivekaḥ ) does not mean here modesty or civility or courtesy. Its philosophical meaning is Discriminating, Distinguishing.
The soul has wandered through the cycle of births and deaths, till now. It is on account of Nondiscrimination. Clear line of distinction should be drawn between the Soul and the Matter. They both are separate entities, One has nothing to do with the other. Each of the two has its own laws which govern its behaviour. This is fa#: (Vivekaḥ); also called #5174 (Bhedajñānam).

At the same time, the edge of the weapon called self-restraint should be extremely sharp so that the enemies, one and all, can be done away with. (8) [120]

मध्यस्थता
(Neutrality)
* Central Idea *
Neutrality is everything. No love, no harted. Therefore no Karmic influx. No mental torture. No mental tension. This is, in other words, मोक्षः (Moksah ) (Emancipation). Har (Samatā )equlibrium of mind is nothing but parennial state of bliss.

Meaning : We hope for good adopting an attitude of neutralily in all activities in a manner where there is no possibility of any fresh bondage according to the example which illustrates that a bull who was formerly a man was brought back to the original position by feeding it again with the herbal grass called life-restoring (assifat ). (8) [128]
Notes : चारिसञ्जीविनीचारन्याय is explained as follows :
There dwelt a Bābmin's daughter along with her female friend in the city called Farfandt. In course of time, marriage separated them. Later, the Brāhmin's daughter had a desire to see her friend, who, when they both met, told her that she was very unhappy as her husband was beyond her control. Consoling her, the Brāhmin's daughter told her not to worry as she would bring him round by turning him into a bull through the administration to him of a magical herb which she would be providing her.
She did as she was instructed by the Brāhmin's daughter. The woman became very unhappy seeing her husband actually turned into a bull. However, she served him, though a bull, by feeding him with grass on the lawns and pastures. Once, under a banyan tree, when the bull was grazing in the presence of the woman, she heard the Vidyādthara (the male demi-god ) perched on the branch revealing the secret to his wife (the female demi-god) that the bull was not really the bull but a human being in the form of a bull and that he can be brought to his original condition of a human being if a magical herb

named Asifat which as he said was under the tree, is now given to him to eat. As the woman was not able to specifically single out the facit from the other herbs, she gave all the herbs to the bull to eat and to her joy and surprise she found the bull turned again into her original husband as there was zsitfart also amongst the herbs which he ate.
zarf means feed given to the bull and ai means one who gives it to the bull, the feeder.

शास्त्रम् ( Scriptures )
* Central Idea *
Ultimately it is the scriptures to which one has to go for guidance. After all, what is de: ( Guruh ) also ? They are the living embodiments of the scriptures. One can get from them what one wants for enlightenment etc. etc. So the scriptures are an ultimate authority for the highest and the lowest. They are everything - the veritable treasure containing tenets, principles, injunctions and instructions bringing peace and prosperity to those who approach them with due regard and obedience.

परिग्रहत्यागः ( Abandoning of Possession )
* Central Idea * This ASTAKA at once declares that possession of things is bad under all circusmtances. It comes in the way of developing the spiritual power to the maximum. But the definition of possession is also to be borne in mind. The author unequivocally says that it is the just ( Herf Mūrcchā) for the things and not the things themselves, which is responsible for the monk being branded as finit ( parigraḥī).

But they become af also, that is to say, they give up their retrograde nature, cease to be a and at that time they are called ff and again go to the zodiacal sign in which they were formerly there. This phenomenon is contrasted with the planet of possession with the remark that it is a planet doing eternal harassment. (1) [193]

(because He and chat are not present). (7) [207]
Notes : During the sleeping state, HE ( Infatuation) is present. During the dreaming state galt (Imagination) is present. So also in the waking state. All these three states are marred by the presence of factors which come in the way of the comprehension of Brahma,

Notes : समापत्ति means attainment. Whose attainment? The reply is Super-Soul's. How ? Through meditation. But of what type should be the conscience of the
meditator ? It should be without वृत्तिs. So चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध is the main thing. Compare :- मणेरिवाभिजातस्य, क्षीणवृत्तेरसंशयम् ।

Notes : 591019 is near-attainment. (4) [236] इत्थं ध्यानफलाधुक्तं विंशतिस्थानकाधपि । कष्टमात्रं त्वभव्यानामपि नो दुर्लभं भवे ॥५॥ ॥२३७॥ ittham dhyānaphalādyuktam

( Penance )
Central Idea *
Body should not be the target for penance. Its aim should be the anhais, desires. There are two divisions of the penance, namely, external and internal. It is the latter, which the author recommends, though he does not denounce the former.

Meaning : Because penance destroys the karmas by heating them, the wise call it knowledge only. That also is desirable if it is internal. The external is merely supportive. (1) [241 ]
Notes : "कर्मणां तापनात् तपः।” This means that ज्ञान (knowledge ) by itself is penance. 34a3ta ( fasting ) is ara 79 (External penance ) while qr27 ( Expiation ) is internal penance. The external penance is useful inasmuch as it supports the internal. Therefore, mere consuming the body is not acceptable to the author. Compare this with “ AGENTUT at affet I" (1) [241 )

Meaning : The attitude of the ignorant which takes the things in its own stride is pleasure-seeking while that of the wise is itself a great penance as it confronts the things which, where and when it should. (2) [242]
Notes : The instinct to imitate (FTTTT AN EFETA ) is not desirable as it is pleasure-seeking. People are most pleasure-loving and therefore, they do not go in for penance. But that is the attitude of the ignorant. The wise will go against this popular trend and will opt for penance. (2) [242]

Meaning : Those who are practising penance and have got superior type of knowledge continually enjoy the bliss as they employ good remedies or are engaged in noble activities and also because their goal is pure. (4) [244]
Notes : gamyraa: means due to the excellent nature of their aim. Not merely Titaa as also not
merely ज्ञानिन्. But ज्ञानिन् who is तपस्विन् and तपस्विन् who is plaa- such a one can enjoy the bliss which goes on increasing. Compare this with the following sloka of

Notes : The Bauddhas believe that penance is useless as it involves physical torture. Contrary is the belief of our author who says that while practising penance, the stream of internal pleasure is flowing. Compare : 7:15 a9: Trà da gitti

Notes : There should be no evil thoughts. There should be no paralysis of the threefold activity. And there should be no decrease in the agility and power of the sense-organs. If these conditions are satisfied, penance is ideal, bonafide. It is said :
सो उ तवो काययो जेण मंगुलं ण चिंतेइ । जेण ण इंदियहाणी जेण य जोगा न हायन्ति ।। (7) [ 247 ] मूलोत्तरगुणश्रेणिप्राज्यसाम्राज्यसिद्धये । बाह्यमाभ्यन्तरं चेत्थं तपः कुर्यान्महामुनिः ॥८॥ ॥२४८॥ mūlottargu naśreni -

Meaning : In order to acquire sovereign monarchy consisting of two classes of principal merits and subordinate merits, the great monk should in this manner practise external as well as internal penance. ( 8 ) [248]
__Notes : Right Knowledge ( सम्यग्ज्ञान ), Right Faith (सम्यगदर्शन), Right Character (सम्यक्चारित्र), observance of the five major vows (प्राणातिपात विरमग, मृषावाद विरमग, अदत्तादान विरमण, मैथुन विरमण and परिग्रह विरमण )-these constitute मूलगुणS (Basic virtues). Five types of carefulness (ईर्या, भाषा, एषणा, आदान, निक्षेप, उत्सर्ग) three types of activity ( मनोयोग, वचनयोग, काययोग), tenfold religion to be observed by the monk and twelvefold penance constitute subsidiary virtues ( उत्तरगुण ).

Meaning : All the view-points have their own separate organization that is to say, run on their own lines and they all take shelter in ( the intrinsic ) nature of things. Therefore, the monk, drawing on all the view.points remains absorbed in his own character. (1) [249]
Notes : To show regard for one view-point and disregard for the other becomes a cause for the breach of character. The monk or any one of an ideal character, should take a synthetic view or should be oven-minded, otherwise there is a danger to his character.
There are seven Nayas, namely - नेगम, संग्रह, व्यवहार, ऋजु, शब्द, समभिरूढ and एवंभूत. ( 1 ) [ 249] .

Notes : This is corroborated by the following sloka :तत्रापि न च द्वेषः कायों विषयस्तु यत्नतो मृग्यः ।।

Meaning : The destruction of the distress accomplished through religious acts and activities, is just like the powder of the dead frog's body. But the same, accomplished through the essential knowledge (FTFATT can also mean, as said before, the book having the title flagit that is to say, the present book itself) is just like the burnt powder of the dead frog's body. (5) [265]
Notes : It is believed ihat the rain, fallen over the powder of the dead body of the frog, recreates it, while, it cannot if it falls over the same powder of the dead body of the frog, if the powder is burnt, The substance of the statement is that fa temporarily destroys the Karmas while an permanently.

Meaning : Religious act or activity, purified by knowledge receives the appelation of the pitcher of gold as advanced by some. And it is true also because gold, that is to say, knowledge remains even if the religious act or activity goes in vain. (6) [266]

Meaning: Between the knowledge without religious activity and religious activity without knowledge there is as much difference as there is between the sun and butterfly. (7) [267]

Notes: This sloka requires some serious understanding, otherwise it is likely to be misinterpreted. One must have the knowledge that a particular religious activity is beneficial. It does not matter if he is unable to do it due to some reason or the other. Knowledge and knowledge only without the corresponding activity to back it or to justify it is not what is advocated here in this sloka. But in between the two, ज्ञान and क्रिया, ज्ञान is more important and therefore it is likened with (Sun) in the
sloka. (7) [267]

Meaning : Total cessation from sinful activities which, in other words, is a bonafide character is nothing but the very climax of knowledge. Attention should be focussed on the complete identity of knowledge with the bonafide conduct ( arfta ). ( 8 ) [268]
Notes : Pure knowledge is excellent conduct and vice versa. There is no distinction as such between highest type of knowledge and highest type of character, conduct ata. After all, knowledge (za) is
II. Mechanical religious act or activity may not be knowledge. But knowledge is, indeed, religious act or activity. This must never be forgotten. (8) [268]

Only those of the very few are pure because of the influence of the essence of knowledge as they are dispossessed of evil passions. ( 2 ) [270]

ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR
Prof. A. S. Gopani M.A., Ph.D., was born at BOTAD in Saurashtra on 12th October, 1907, in the famous Jain family.
He graduated in 1929, became M.A. in 1934 and took his doctorate in 1947, with special subjects of Prakrit, Jain Philosophy and Jain literature.
He was selected by the Baroda State Government as a scholar to receive training at Paris under the late Dr. Sylvain Levi, but due to his ill health, he could not go.
Having served at various places for about ten years, he finally joined the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in 1939 as a professor and from that time till today he has published about thirtysix books comprising critical editions, research works, translations and some original books also. He is also credited with having written two hundred fifty articles, the same number of short stories and about one hundred fifty critical reviews in Gujarati and English.
Moreover, he was the Editor of a fortnightly in Gujarati, viz, “Ratna Jyot" for about eighteen years.
As a mark of appreciation and recognition of his outstanding performance as a distinguished scholar, the University Grants Commission honoured him with an Award.
He retired in 1970. At seventy-nine, though formally retired, he is bent upon completing the literary project submitted by him to the University Grants Commission. He continues to work undeterred by frailty of health.
We wish him a long and purposeful life.
