PREFACE.
This translation was made in 1917 at Indore after I had finished my translation of Jíva Kánda (Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas). Only this, Part I, was translated. My official duties, health and many similar circumstances obstructed both a further translation and an earlier publication. In this, as in the publication of my other long-lain manuscripts, I am beholden beyond repayment to my beloved and revered brethren Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasadaji and Pandit Ajit Prasada, M.A., LL.B., both of whom have been doing this labour of love and piety at Lucknow from August 1926.
Karma Kánda, in brief, is a scientific analysis of Evil, of Sin. Evil is material, as God or the Pure Soul is certainly immaterial. The Jiva Kánda deals primarily with the Soul ; the Karma Kanda with the material and self-forged Karmic fetters of this soul. It describes the matter and manner of this bondage, so that true and accurate knowledge may help the imprisoned, embodied soul to live a life leading to freedom and Bliss.
Indeed the only use of true books-the “Bibles” of the world-is to teach people how to live. Otherwise they are a "dull and endless strife", and the over production of books on all subjects and in all countries may well be called a prostitution of the Press, and distraction and dissipation of the human intellect. The Press is like the Frankenstein of old, which created by man, has mastered him to the strangling point. The fiction Magazine with its teachings of crime and lasciviousness, the daily newspaper with its reports of divorces, dacoities, and all the dirty details of human defects and aberrations, are the greatest instruments of the Devil.

Our costly and artificial systems of Education and Government also seem to be open to the same objection mostly. Well have the Conquerors of pain and ignorance (the Jinas) prohibited frivolous talk, jests, pranks, stories of sex, crime, political gossip, etc., etc., as Pramáda (carelessness) leading to entanglement in Samsára (mundane life), and obscuring the real qualities of the soul. As it is impossible to improve upon that wonderful gem of Jaina Sacred Literature, the Jaina Bible, I have purposely quoted at length, in the Introduction, from Saint Umasvami's Tattvártha Sútra, as it gives the eternal, patent remedies and procedure for lessening and removing human ills.
It is a very long process to show the application of these remedies to our many and complex needs of every-day life; and it is obviously impossible to indicate their application to individual needs. But the remedies are these, and every man and woman, knowing his or her own faults and frailties, needs and desires, can easily find guidance after studying these general rules of right human conduct. The test of the pudding is in the eating thereof; and the test of the value of these teachings is when a man follows them and finds that they cure his weakness and sorrow and give him peace, power, calmness, a noble delight in his own work and life, and joyous co-operation and brotherly service in his relations with his neighbours and living beings generally. In one word, these teachings instil into one an insight of his being a chip of the eternal Omniscience and Omnipotence which we call GOD, and at the same time excite him into an easy, almost instinctive, realisation of his being a happy member of the Universal Fraternity of all Living Beings.
Whatever is correct in this volume, is due to the grace of the Títhamkaras and the kindness of my devoted friends at Lucknow ; but whatever is a mistake in matter and manner is entirely due to my unworthiness and laziness, i. e., to my Pramáda.

INTRODUCTION.
Gommața-Sára, Karma-Kánda is really a complement of Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhánta Chakravarti's Jíva Kánda of Gommata Sára. For general remarks on the whole book, reference may be made to the Introduction to my translation of Jíva Kánda Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas. Here only Karma Kánda will be dealt with.
The Six Substances.
Space and time are co-extensive and infinite. Space consists of the Universe (Loka), and the Non-Universe (Aloka). The Universe consists of two substances: Living (Jiva) and non-Living (Ajiva). The Living alone has consciousness, power to attend and to know. The non-Living has neither Consciousness, nor Attention, nor Knowledge. This is of 5 kinds: (1) Matter (Pudgala) i. e., table, chair, brick, stone, etc. (2) Principle of Motion (Dharma) which is an essential auxiliary of the motion of souls and matter. (3) Principle of Rest (Adharma), which is a similar auxiliary of the cessation of the movements of souls and matter. (4) Time (Kála), in virtue of which things become old, new, or continue in their existence. (5) Space (Akásha), which gives their place or location to all substances. These six, Jíva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, Kála, and Ákásha, are called the six substances or Dravyas.
Dravya.
Dravya literally means flowing or continuing. It is so-called, because it flows or continues the same through all its modifications. It is called "Sat" or Existence also. Existence or substance is a collective name for a trinity-unity of Birth (Utpáda), Decay (Vyaya) and continuance (Dhrauvya).

Attributes (Guna).
A Substance further is a group of attributes and modifications. As there are 6 substances, some attributes are general or common; others are special. Sámánya-guna, or common attributes are found in all substances; these are the attributes which are necessary for the existence of the group, as a group or substance.
These are infinite but 6 are principal :
1. Astitva, Is-ness; Indestructibility; permanence; the capacity by which a substance cannot be destroyed. 2. Vastutva, Functionality; capacity by which a substance has a function.
3. Dravyatva, Change-ability, capacity by which it is always changing in modifications.
4
4. Prameyatva, Know-ability: capacity of being known by someone, or of being the subject-matter of knowledge. 5. Agurulaghutva, Individuality; capacity by which one attribute or substance does not become another and the substance does not lose the attributes whose grouping forms the substance itself.
6. Pradeshatva, Spatiality, capacity of having some kind of location in space.
Chetanatva, Consciousness
Amúrtatva, Immateriality Achetanatva, Unconsciousness
Amúrtatva, Immateriality Achetanatva, Unconsciousness
...

are common attributes of the class of substance, or group of attributes, called Soul.
are common to Space, Motion, Rest and Time.
are common to Matter.
Múrtatva, Materiality
Vishesha guna are special attributes of a particular substance. These are the attributes which distinguish one group from the others.
Vishesha-guna or special attributes of each substance are:1. Jíva-Soul 1. Knowledge. In its full form it arises only in the absence of knowledge-obscuring karma.
2. Conation. In its full form it arises only in the absence of conation-obscuring karma.
3. Pliss. In its full form it arises only in the absence
of all the 4 destructive karmas, etc.
4. Fower. In its full form it arises only in the absence of obstructive karmas, etc.



Page #12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

5. Right Belief In its full form it arises only 6. Right Conduct in the absence of deluding karma. 7. Avyávádha. Undisturbable, due to the absence of
vedaniya or feeling karma ; neither pleasure nor
pain. 8. Avagáha, Penetrability, due to the absence of
age-karma. 9. Agurulaghutva, due to the absence of famíly-de
termining-karmą. 10. Súkshmatva, fineness due to the absence of body
making karma. The first 6 are Anujíví attributes, which co-exist in and constitute the substance.
They arise fully only on the destruction (kshaya) of the 4 destructive (Ghátíya) karmas ; Conation-and-Knowledge-obscuring; Deluding; and Obstructive.
The last 4 are Pratijiví attributes, which merely indicate the absence of their opposites.
They arise fully on the destruction (Kshaya) of the 4 non-destructive (Aghátíya) karmas; Feeling, Age; Family-determining and Body-making karmas. 2. Pudgala, matter has for its special attributes :
1. Touch ; 2. Taste; 3. Smell &
4. Colour. 3. Dharma, has for its special attribute the quality of being the medium of motion.
4. Adharma, medium of rest.
5. Ákásha, Space; its special attribute is to give place to all substances.
6. Kála, Time; its special attribute is to bring about modifications.
Modifications (Paryaya). Modifications occur only with reference to attributes. This alone is what is meant by Birth and Decay. Modifications or conditions change :-- i.e., a new condition is born, i.e. comes into existence (Utpada), and the old one decays, i.e. goes out of existence (Vyaya). The essential attributes of the substance always through all these modifications. It must be clearly understood and

constantly remembered that substance is one; the birth and decax in its modification, and the continuance of the Substance itself are only 3 aspects of viewing one and the same thing. Also Substance (Dravya), Attribute (Guna) and Modification (Paryaya) are three mutually interpervasive aspects of the one trinity-unity; Attribute is nothing different from Substance and Modification. So for all the three. When we talk or think of one, we necessarily talk or think of the remaining two. The threefold distinction is merely for the purpose of exposition and explanation by our limited knowledge to others of limited knowledge. The soul with Omniscience sees the whole trinity-unity in its entirety at one and the same time.
The Embodied Soul. In the Universe, the Jíva Dravya or Soul is found mixed with non-living matter. Even the most ordinary and the least civilised men, even animals, exhibit their recognition of this fact. For Death is a most universal and eternal phenomenon. The living body is
ng ; when death intervenes, the body becomes lifeless, or dies. Life has left the body. This Life is the Soul : the body represents the grossest and most visible form of matter, with which the Life was clothed, and which was “Living” only so long as Life or Soul was united with it.
The 7 Tattvas. The Soul (Jiva) and the Non-Soul (Ajíva) are the first two Tattvas. The most important non-Soul is the Pud gala Dravya Matter-Substance. The most important combination of soul and matter is our body.
It is also manifest that this body is constantly changing, in - virtue of our activity of mind, speech and body. A feeling of modesty in the mind of the maiden paints her cheeks with blush. A sad thought gives one a long face. Criminal broodings breed a criminal look in a man or woman. The pious chanting of a hymn or prayer gilds one with the calm detachment and glory of the halo of a priest or devotee. Our food, dress, play and work, all bring about constant changes in the body.
Matter attracts matter. Generally the law of nature is "like to like." The matter of bad thoughts attracts matter of bad thought, and ultimately becomes the father of a bad habit. This attraction of good or bad matter by the soul in virtue of its mental, vocal, or bodily activity, is called Inflow (Ashrava).
When the attracted matter has actually become a part of our body, i.e., when it has become bound to the soul as the body is

already bound to it, it is called Bondage (Bandha). The Persian word bandah "bound" for man, is literally true in this sense of Jainism. The Christian "Fall of Man" by the absorption of Sin by man, is a parallel doctrine.
If by pious attention and right conduct, the Inflow is stopped; it is Stoppage (Samvara).
The gradual shedding of the matter already bound is shedding (Nirjará).
The total separation of Soul from the bondage of all matter is Liberation (Moksha).
In brief, Jíva or Soul plus Karma or Matter is what it is now in its embodied, mundane condition; and the embodied soul minus all matter is what the Soul will be in its Pure and Liberated condition in Moksha.
Matter.
This matter (Pudgala) is of 6 kinds :
1. Gross-gross, or very gross matter (solid), e.g. a mountain, a pillar of iron, etc. This class of matter when divided, cannot be united without the use of a third something;
2. Gross (liquid), e.g. water, oil, etc. On division this can be united without the intervention of a third thing;
4. Gross-fine, e.g. shade, sunshine. It is interesting to compare this with the corpuscular theory of light in Western physics, before it was replaced by the modern wave-theory of Huygens. It is matter which looks gross or tangible, but cannot be grasped ;
4. Fine-gross, e.g. fragrance, sound, sweetness etc.; the distinction between this and gross-fine being that gross-fine is more gross than fine because it can be seen as light, shade, etc.; whereas fine-gross cannot be seen, although its origin may be gross. The gases of science would be fine-gross. Fine-gross includes all things that may be perceived by the senses of touch, taste, smell or sound;
5. Fine, matter capable of becoming karmic matter. It cannot be perceived by the senses;
6. Fine-fine, matter which has for its atoms the combination of two or more ultimate atoms (paramánu). According to some Saints it is the ultimate atom itself. (Vide Jiva Kanda, Gáthás 602-3. Outlines of Jainism, Pages 21-22.)
From the molecular point of view, Matter is of 23 kinds :
1. Atom, anu varganá.
2. Numerable-atoms-molecule, Sankhyátánu-Varganá.

Of these the most important are Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Of all mundane souls there are 5 bodies only.
1. Audárika, the physical body of all men and animals.
2. Vaikriyika, Fluid, the body of hellish and celestial beings, which they can change at will.
3. Áháraka, assimilative, the spiritual man-like emanation from the head of a saint in doubt, in the sixth spiritual stage.
4. Taijasa. Electric body of mundane souls which always accompanies them.
""

5. Karmic body found in all mundane souls.
The first 3 bodies are made of Áháraka Varganá molecules of assimilative matter. (No. 5).
The electric body is made of Taijasa Varganá (No. 7).
Our speech is made of Bháshá Varganá No. 9; our mind, of mano Varganá, No. 11; and our karmic body of Karma-varganá, No. 13.
Karmic Matter.
Now it is with this last mostly that we deal here.

Inflow of Karmie Matter.
Inflow of Karmic matter towards the soul is caused by the vibratory activity of mind, speech and body.
If the vibratory activity is with passion, the inflow leads to bondage of soul by karmic matter. It is called Sámparáyika or Mundane Inflow.
If it is without passion, i. e., purely vibration in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth spiritual stages and does not lead to bondage, it is called fryápatha or transient or fleeting Inflow.
39 kinds of Inflow.
The Mundane Inflow is of 39 kinds, according to its causes: 5. Caused by the activity of the 5 Senses.

2. Mithyátva-kriyá, that which strengthens wrong belief, e. g., superstition, etc.
3. Prayoga-kriyá, bodily movement.
4. Samádána-kriyá, tendency to neglect vows, after having taken them.
5. Iryápatha-kriya, walking carefully, i.e., looking on the ground for protecting living beings which may be trod upon and thus injured.
6. Prádoshiki-kriyá, tendency to accuse others in anger.
7. Káyiki-kriya, a wicked man's readiness to hurt others.
8. Adhikaranikí-kriyá, having weapons of hurtfulness.

13. Pratyáyiki-kriyá, inventing new sense-enjoyments.
14. Samantánupátana-kriyá, answering call of nature in a place frequented by men, women or animals.
15. Anábhoga-kriyá, indifference in dropping things or throwing oneself down upon the earth, i. e. without seeing whether it is swept or not.

16. Svahasta-kriya, undertaking to do by one's own hand, what should be done by others.
17. Nisarga Kriya, admiration of hurtful or unrighteous things.
18, Vidárana-kriyá, proclaiming other's sins.
19. Ájná-vyápádiki-kriya, misinterpreting the scriptural injunctions, which we do not want to follow,
20. Anákánkshá kriya, disrespect to scriptural injunctions out of vice or laziness.
21. Prárambha-kriya, engaging in harmful activities or expressing delight in other's misdeeds.
22. Párigráhiki-kriya, trying to persevere in one's attachment to worldly belongings,
23. Máyákriyá, deceitful disturbance of some one's right knowledge and faith.
24. Mithya-darshana-kriya, praising actions due to wrong belief.
25. Apratyakhyána-kriyá, not renouncing what ought to be renounced.
Note that the Senses, Passions and Vowlessness are the causes and the 25 kinds of activity are their effects.
Differences in Inflow. The differences in inflow in different souls caused by the same activity arise from differences in the following:
1. Intensity of desire or thought-activity. 2. Mildness » » » » 3. Intentional character of the act. 4. Unintentional character of the act.
5. Dependence of the act upon living and non-living substances or activities.
6. One's own position and power to do the act.
The Dependence (Adhikarana) is of two kinds, relating to the souls and the non-souls.
The first, i. e., dependence on the souls is of 108 kinds due to differences in the following:
1. Samrambha. Determination to do a thing. Compare intention for an offence in Criminal Law.
2. Samárambha. Preparation for it, i.e. collecting materials for it. Compare in Criminal Law the conduct of the criminal before committing the offence.




Page #18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

11
3. Árambha. Commencement of it Compare Attempt in Criminal Law.
These three can be done by three yogas, i.e., activity of mind, body and speech, thus there are 3x 3-9 kinds. Each one of the 9 kinds can be done in three ways, i.e. by doing oneself, or having it done by others, or by approval or acquiescence. Thus we get 27 kinds. Each one of the 27 may be due to the 4 passions. That gives us 27 x4=108 kinds. Thus the Jaina rosary has 108 beads, one for each of these 108 Jívádhikaranás.
These 108 kinds can become of 432 kinds, if we consider each passion in its 4 aspects of Error-feeding or Right-belief-preventing, partial-vow-preventing, total-vow-preventing and perfect conduct
preventing.
The second kind of dependence relating to the non-soul is of the following 11 kinds.
2 Kinds of Production: (1) Múla Guna, i. e. of the body, speech, mind and respiration, (2) Uttara gana, i. e. production of books, pictures, statues, etc.
4 kinds of putting down a thing (1) Apratya Vekshita, without seeing, (2) Duh-pramrishţa, petulantly, peevishly, (3) Sahasá, hurriedly and (4) Anábhoga, where it ought not to be put.
2 kinds of mixing up (1) Bhakta-pána, food and drink, (2) Upakarana, mixing up of things necessary for doing any act.
3 kinds of movement by (1) Káya, body, (2) Váng, speech, (3) Mana, mind.
Inflow of the Eight Karmas.
I-II-KNOWLEDGE AND CONATION-OBSCURING.
The inflow of knowledge and conation-obscuring karmic matter, is caused by the following:
1. Depreciation of those who are learned in the scriptures.
2, Concealment of knowledge.
3. Envy; jealousy. Refusal to impart knowledge out of
envy.
4. Obstruction. Hindering the progress of knowledge.
5, Denying the truth proclaimed by another, by body and
speech.
6. Refuting the truth, although it is known to be such.

III.- Feeling. The inflow ef pain-bringing-feeling (Asátá-vedaniya) karmic matter is due to the following feelings and acts :
1. Dukha, pain. 2. Shoka, sorrow. 3. Tápa, repentance, remorse. 4. Ákrandana, weeping. 5. Badha, depriving of vitality. 6. Paridevana, piteous or pathetic moaning to attract compassion.
These 6 can be produced in one's own self, in another, or both in one's self and another. Thus there are 18 forms of this inflow.
1. Bhútá-anukampá, compassion for all living beings. 2. Vratyanukampá, compassion for the vowers, 3. Dána, Charity, 4. Sarága-samyama, self-control with slight attachment; etc., 5. Samyam-asamyama, restraint by vows of some, but not of others, 6. A káma-niriará, equanimous submission to the fruition of karma, 7. Bála tapa, austerities not based upon right knowledge, 8. Yoga, contemplation, 9. Kshanti, forgiveness, and 10. Shaucha, contentment, these are the causes of inflow of pleasure-bearing feeling karmic matter, (Sátá-vendaniya).
IV.-Deluding. The inflow of Darshana mohaniya, right-belief-deluding karmic matter is caused by Avarnaváda, defaming the Omniscient Lord. Arhat Kevali ; the Scriptures, Shruta ; the Saints' brotherhoods, Sangha : the true Religion, Dharma ; and the Celestial beings. Deva, e, g. saying that the celestial beings take meat or wine, etc. and to offer these as sacrifices to them.
The inflow of right-conduct-deluding karmic matter is caused by the intense thought-activity produced by the rise of the passions and of the quasi-passion, no kashaya.
E.g. Joking about Truth, etc., disinclination to take vows, etc. including in evil society, etc.
V.-Age, As the age-karma, the inflow of Narakáyu karma, hellish age karma is caused by too much wordly activity and by attachment to too many worldly objects or by too much attachment.
B.a. committing breaches of the first five vows of non-killing, truth, non-stealing, chastity, non-attachment to wordly possessions. The point to be noted is that it is not the possession or ownership of wordly wealth which is sinful but it is the attachment to it which is a sin. Aman may be in the world ; but he must not be of it.

The inflow of Tiryancha-áyu, sub-human age karma is caused by Máyá, deceit.

E.g. cheating others, preaching the false doctrines, etc.
The inflow of Manushya-Ayu, human-age-karma, is caused by slight wordly activity and by attachment to a few worldly objects or by slight attachment.
Natural humble disposition is also the cause of human-age
karma.
Vowlessness and sub-vowlessness with slight worldly activity and slight attachment, are causes of the inflow of all kinds of agekarmas.
Not taking the vows of laymen and not adopting the restrictions (shíla), but having slight attachment to the world and activity in it, can be the cause of the inflow of age-karmic matter of all four kinds. The inflow of Deva-Ayu celestial-age-karma is caused by :
1. Sarága-samyama, self-control with slight attachment found in monks only.
2. Samyamásamyama, restraint of some vows, but not of others, found in laymen only.
3. Akáma-nirjará, equanimous submission to the fruition of
karma.
4. Bálatapa, austerities not based upon right knowledge.
Right-belief is also the cause of celestial-age karma, but only of the heavenly order. It applies to human and sub-human beings only. A celestial or hellish right-believer binds the human-agekarma. Note also that if a human or sub-human being has bound a particular age-karma before gaining right belief, he must enjoy that. (See Jiva Kánda, Gáthás 292, 527, 645).
VI. Body making.
The inflow of Ashubha-náma, a bad-body-making karma is caused by a non-straightforward or deceitful working of the mind, body or speech or by Visamváda, wrangling, etc., wrong-belief, back-biting, self-praise, censuring others, etc.
envy,
The inflow of good-body-making karma is caused by the causes which are opposite of the above viz. by straightforward dealings with body, mind and speech; by avoiding disputes, etc., rightbelief, humility, admiring praiseworthy people, etc.

The inflow of Tirthamkara-body-making karma is caused by meditation (Bhávaná) of the following 16 matters :
1. Darshana-vishuddhi, purity of right-belief. Pure rightbelief is with 8 Angas or the following 8 qualities :
1. Nisshankita. Free from all doubt. 2. Nishkánkshita. Free from wordly desire. 3. Nir vichikitsita. Free from repulsion from anything. 4. Amúdha drishtitva. Free from superstitious belief. 5. Upa-brimhana or more popularly, Upa gúhana. Ad

Even one of these, if properly contemplated and with rightbelief, brings about the inflow of Tirthankara-body making-karma. VII.-Family-determining.
15
The inflow of low-family-determining karma is caused by: 1. Paranindá, speaking ill of others;
2. Átma prashansá, praising oneself;
3.
Sad gunochchhádana, concealing the good qualities of others; and
4.
Asad guna udbhávana, proclaiming in oneself the good qualities which one does not possess.
The inflow of the next, i. e., high family-determining karma is caused by the opposites of the above, i. e.,
1. Para prashansá, praising others;
2. Átma nindá, denouncing one's self;
3. Parsad gunaudbhávana, proclaiming the good qualities of others;
4. Átmasad-guna uchchhádana, not proclaiming one's own good qualities;
5. Nichaih Vritti, an attitude of humility towards one's betters, and
6. Anutseka, not being proud of one's own achievement or attainments.

VIII-Obstructive.
The inflow of obstructive (Antaráya) karma is caused by disturbing others in charity; gain; enjoyment of consumable things; enjoyment of non-consumable things and making use of their powers.
Note. The inflow of 7 karmas, i. e., of all except the age-karma, is going on always, in souls influenced by the Passions, and of the age-karma also on special occasions; but the predominance of the above causes will determine the intensity of fruition (anubhága) of their particular inflow.
The special occasions of age-karma are 8 in one man's life, as follows:-Supposing a man's life is to be 81 years long. The first occasion for binding the age-karma will be on his passing 2/3 of it, i. e., when he is 54. The second on his passing 23 of the remainder, i. e., when he is 72. The third on his passing 28 of the remainder, i. e., when he is 78. The fourth on his passing 2/3 of the remainder again, i. e., when he is 80. Similarly the fifth when he is 80 years, 8 months. The sixth at 80 years, 10 months and 20 days. The seventh at 30 years, 11 months, 16 days and 16 hours.



Page #23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

16
The eighth at 80 years, 11 months, 25 days, 13 hours, and 20 minutes If no age-karma is bound yet, the ninth is the last antar-nauhúrta of his life. The point is that the man is born with his particular age-karma already bound. Therefore he must bind the age karma of his next incarnation at the latest at the last moment.
BONDAGE
-
Causes of Bondage. The causes of Bandha or bondage are :--
1. Wrong-Belief. Mithyadarshana, wrong-belief, is of 5 kinds.
1. Ekánta. Taking only one aspect of a many-sided thing e. g., man is mortal and immortal, regarded from the point of view of body and soul respectively. Taking only one view is Ekánta.
2. Viparita. Perverse belief, e.g , Animal sacrifices lead to heaven. Injury to anyone cannot be a cause of merit.
3. Samshaya-Doubt, scepticism, hesitation, e.g., as to path of Liberation.
4. Vinaya. Veneration. Taking all religions and gods, even the so-called religions which enjoin cruel or immoral practices, to be equally worthy of pursuit.
5. Ajnána. Wrong belief caused by ignorancé. Indiscrimination of good and bad.
Wrong belief is caused by Nisarga, inborn error; or by Adhigama, preaching of another.
The last is of 4 kinds: -
Kriyávádi, belief in time, soul, etc. as causing everything in the world. All the substances perform their functions and become causes of different effects. To uphold otherwise is wrong belief.
Akriyá vádi, opposite of the last, e. g., the soul does nothing. This undermines all truth. If the soul does nothing, who is responsible for the doing and fruition of our good and bad actions ?
Ajnánika, Agnostic. -Everything is not knownable. This is one of the general attributes of all substances How then can it be said that nothing is knowable? It may be unknowable from some point of view ; but that is all
Vaineyika, Religion is identical with veneration of parents, king, etc., e. g., Confucianism. Obviously veneration and eternal truth are not identical.
All these four together form 363 varieties of wrong belief i, e., 180, 84,67 and 32 respectively.

Nisargaja is also called Agrahita ; and Adhigamaja is called Grahíta.
Vowlessness. Avirata, Vowlessness, Non-renunciation is of 12 kinds :
Lack of compassion for 6 classes of embodied souls; and lack of restraint of 5 senses and 1 mind.
Carelessness. Pramáda, Carelessness is of 15 kinds :
4 Kinds of Kathá, talk, about :
1. Food (Bhojana-Kathá). 2. Women (Stri-Kathá). 3. Politics (Rájya-Kathá).
4. Scandal (Desha-Kathá). 5 Senses. 4 Passions. 1 Affection. 1 Sleep.
15 1 Kathá x 1 Sense x 1 Passion * 1 Sneha x 1 Nidrá make one combination or one kind of Pramáda.
So: 4 kinds of talk x 5 senses * 4 passsions x 1 affection X 1 sleep make : 80 kinds.
Passions. Kasháya, Passions, are 4, i.e. Anger, Pride, Deceit and Greed.
Vibrations. Yoga, Vibrations in the soul, through mind, body and speech, are of 15 kinds :4 of mind :--
1. Satya mana, true mind. 2. Asatya mana, false mind, 3. Ubhaya mana, mixed true and false mind.
4. Anubhaya-mana, neither true nor false. 4 of speech :

7. Kármana: Karmic. Note.-The Taijasa, electric body, is always found with the karmic body. It never has an independent yoga. The electric molecules are drawn like the karmic molecules by the vibrations set in the soul by yoga of any kind. (For details of yoga, see Jiva Kanda Chapter IX Gathas 216 et seqq.)
Karmic matter is bound to the soul by the Vibrations (yoga) of mind, speech and body, coloured by Passions (Kasháya) of Anger, Pride, Deceit, and Greed mainly. The vibrations determine the kind (Prakriti) and the quantity (Pradesha) of the Karmic matter to be drawn towards and bound to the soul. The Passions determine the duration (Sthiti)of the bondage, and the mild or intense fruition (Anubhága of the karma at its maturity.
Kinds of Bondage, There are 8 kinds of Prakritis of Karmic matter:
1. Jnáná varana, Knowledge-obscuring, 2. Darshanávarana, Conation-obscuring. 3. Vedaniya, Feeling karma, 4. Mohaniya, Deluding. 5. Áyu, Age. 6. Náma, Body-making. 7. Gotra, Family.determining, 8. Anataráya, Obstructive,

The 8 Karmas have respectively 5, 9, 2, 28, 4, 93, 2 and 5 sub-classes, i. e., 148 sub-classes in all.
Some Ácháryas treat the 93 sub-classes of the bodymaking Karma differently.
I. It will be noticed above that the 93 fall under 42 headings, Gati (condition of existence), Játi (Genus) etc. Taking these 42 only as sub-classes, the total instead of 148 is 148-(93-42)-148-51 i. e., only 97.

Of these, 1, 5, 9, 13, and 15 are represented by the 5 (Nos. 58 to 62). Therefore if the remaining 10 sub-classes are added, we get 97 + 10 - 107 or 148 + 10 - 158 total sub-classes.
III. The 20 sub-classes (Nos. 89 to 108), i. e., of touch (8), taste (5), smell (2), and colour (5) may be associated with merit (punya) or demerit (pápa). This division will add 20 to the totals. Thus the total will be 168.
Thus considering the important Body-making Karma in the above different ways, we get the total of sub-classes of all karmas as 97, 107, 148, 158 or 168.
But mainly in all Jaina books only the total of 148 is considered for all purposes.
The Quantity of Bondage. As to Pradesha, according to the nature caused by their names, from all round, due to the differences in the vibrations (Yoga) in the soul-activity, not perceptible by the senses, the karmic molecules enter and become one and stay with every Pradesha of the soul. They come in infinite numbers, every moment, to each soul.
The particular number of the molecules actually absorbed is called pradesha-bandha.
Duration of Bondage. As to Duration, the maximum duration of the 3 from the first, i.e., Knowledge-obscuring, Conation-obscuring and Feeling karmas, and of Obstructive karmas, is 30 crore x crore Ságaras.
This is possible in a rational 5-sensed, fully developable (paryápta) soul, who has wrong belief (Mithyátva).
The maximum duration of Deluding-karma is :- 70 crore x crore Ságaras.
The maximum duration of Náma, Body-making and Gotra, Family-determining, karmas is 20 crore X crore Sagaras for each.
This is also possible as above. The maximum duration of Syu, Age karma is 33 Sagaras.
The minimum duration of Vedaniya, Feeling karma is 12 Mu. húrtas - 12 x 48 minutes - - 9 hours 36 minutes. That of Náma, Body-making and Gotra, Family-determining is 8 Muhúrtas.

Of all the rest, the minimum is one Antar-muhúrta, which ranges from, 1 Samaya and 1 ávali at the lowest to 48 minutes minus one Samaya.
Fruition of Karma. As to Fruition, it is according to the name of the karma, e.g., knowledge-obscuring karma prevents the acquisition of knowledge and so on.
Stopping of Inflow. Samvara is the stoppage of inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
The causes of Inflow and Bondage are given above.
Wrong belief (Mithyá darshana) is stopped (Samvara) in the 4th spiritual stage (Guņa sthána);
Vowlessness (Avirata) in the 5th and 6th ; Carelessness (Pramáda) in the 7th ; Passion (Kasháya) in the 8th, 9th and 10th;
Vibration (Yoga) in the 14th stage. For the 14 Spiritual Stages see below :Samvara or Stoppage of Inflow is produced by :
3 kinds of Gupti, Preservation. 5 „ „ Samiti, Carefulness. 10 „ „, Dharma, Observances ; (Dharma).
Anupreksha, Meditation. 22, ,, Parishaha-jaya, Sub-dual of sufferings ; and
5, „Charitra, Conduct. By austerities is caused the shedding of karmic matter, and also stoppage of inflow.
3 Preservations. Gupti, Preservation is proper control (nigraha) over mind, speech and body.
5 Carefulness. Samiti, Carefulness is to take care. Samyaka íryá samiti, Proper care in walking. Samyaka bháshá samiti, ,, , ,, speaking. Samyaka eshaná samiti , „ „ eating.
Samyaka ádána nikshepa samiti. Proper care in lifting and laying.

12. Dharma svakhya tattvánupreksha, Nature of Right-Path as said by the conquerors. The true nature of Truth, i. e., the 3 fold path to real Liberation.
These must be meditated upon again and again. As to the first kind of meditation, viz., transitoriness, anity á anupreksha, it must be noted that as Substance, everything is permanent. Only condition is transitory. Of the matter assimilated as karma and non-karma by the soul, that which is accepted by the soul is called Upátta. The rest is Anupatta matter which is not taken in by the soul.
22 Sufferings, For the sake of non-falling-off from the path of Liberation, and for the shedding of Karmic matter, whatever sufferings are undergone calmly and with religious renunciation are called the Sufferings (Parishaha). The 22 Sufferings are :
1. Hunger. 2. Thirst. 3. Cold. 4. Heat. 5. Troubles form Insect bites ; mosquitoes, etc. 6. Nakedness. To bear calmly the troubles of climate,
unpopularity, etc., due to the vow of absolute pos
sessionlessness, i. e., nakedness. 7. Ennui, dissatisfaction, languor. 8. Women. Resisting temptations from and desire for
women. 9. Walking too much: not to feel the fatigue, but to
bear it calmly. 10. Continuous sitting in one posture. Not to disturb
the posture of meditation, even if there is danger
from lion, snakes, etc., etc. 11. Sleeping. Resting on the hard earth. 12. Abuse. 13. Beating. 14. Begging. To resist the temptation of begging even

19. Respect or disrespect by admirers or enemies. 20. To resist Conceit of knowledge ; and to be full of
humility. 21. Lack of knowledge. Not to be pained, even though
it is felt that one does not know much 22 Slack belief, e g., on failure to attain supernatural
powers even after great piety and austerities to begin to doubt the truth of Jainism and its teachings.
5. - Charitras, The 5 kinds of Right-conduct are :1. Equanimity. 2. Recovery of equanimity after a fall from it. 3. Pure and absolute non-injury. 4. All but entire freedom from passion.
5. Ideal and passionless conduct (Parihara-vishuddhi). It is found only in a man of 38 years, who has served the Tírthankara for 8 years, i.e. from the age of 30 to that of 38). He must have read the Pratyakhyanapúrva. (See Jiva Kanda Gáthas 471-2).
Shedding of Karmic Matter. Nirjará means the falling away of karmic matter from the soul. The fetters may by themselves gradually wear out and leave the soul free: but it is a long process. Therefore a shorter method is adopted; deliberate activity may hasten the ripening of a karma and the shedding of its matter. To illustrate : we wish evil to our neighbour A; the thought-activity invites the-karmic matter into the soul (ásrava), the matter comes and binds the soul (bandha). This karma may take two months to bear its full fruits ; in the meantime it is an evil load for the soul. To gain lightness and to get rid of the karma, the soul may deliberately feel an oppozite kind of feeling towards other neighbours B, C, and D, or towards A himself. A still surer way is to practise austerity. By removing the mind from the demands and impulses of the body, and by mortifying the physical man through not listening to its greed and temptations, matter may be overcome and soul freed from the bondage.
The natural maturing of a karma and its separation from the soul is called savipaka-nirjará. Inducing a karma to leave the soul by means of a contrary karma, or by means of ascetic practices, is called avipáká nírjará (riddance without fruition).
The terminology of the distinction is derived from botany. A seed grows into a fruit. It may ripen by itself (savipáka); or it

may be plucked half-ripe, or even unripe, and then ripened by artificial means.
The causes of stopping of inflow of Karmic matter given above (pages 26-7) are also causes of the shedding of the karmas already bound to the soul.
In addition to these, austerities (tapa) also cause the shedding before its time.
Tapa, austerities are external and internal.
External austerities are:
1
Anashana, Fasting.
2. Avamodarya, Eating less than one's fill, or less than one has appetite for.
3. Vritti-parísankhyána, Taking a mental vow to accept food from a house-holder, only if a certain condition is fulfilled, without letting any one know about the vow.
4. Rasa parityága, Daily renunciation of one or more of 6 kinds of delicacies, viz. :
1. Ghee (Butter, clarified butter).
2. Milk.
3. Curd.
4. Sugar.
5. Salt.
6. Oil.
5. Vivikta-shayyásana, sitting and sleeping in a lonely place, devoid of anímate beings.
6. Káya klesha, Mortification of the body, so long as the mind is not disturbed.
The other, i.e., Internal austerities are also 6 :
1. Prayashchitta, Expiation.
2. Vinaya, Reverence.
3. Vaiyávritya, Service of the saints or worthy people.
4. Svádhyaya, Study.
5. Vyutsarga, Giving up attachment to the body, etc. 6. Dhyána, concentration.
Liberation.
When all the karmic matter has left the soul, it becomes the Pure Soul, the Realised (Siddha) or the Liberated (Mukta) Soul,
Now in Jainism, the soul is immaterial and has none of the special attributes of Matter. Matter is devoid of consciousness and has none of the special attributes of Soul.

Mind is matter. Karmas are matter. Pleasure and pain are matter. Prosperity and adversity are matter, as being the pleasure and pain feeling karma, due to the presence or absence of some kind of matter.
The Saint Shri Kunda Kunda says in Panchástikáyá Gáthá 82:
"Things enjoyable by the senses, the five senses themselves, the bodies (including the five kinds of bodies, the mind, the Karmas, and the other material objects-all this know as matter (pudgala)."
All matter is visible, even karmic matter, though not to our physical eye. Certainly mental matter is visible directly to mental knowledge.
The inflow and bondage of Karmic matter being the essential causes of all pain and pleasure, it is possible in the light of Jainism to try to find out, what kind of Karma is the cause of a particular kind of pain or failure, and how the inflow of that karma is stopped and how, if it is already bound, it can be shed. If this is done even roughly and approximately, the study of Karmas becomes of immense and intense practical value. Also with caution and patience, it can be tested by and made a subject of, experiments. Perhaps some day in the hands of some lucky scientist, its results may be proved by science, like. The life, etc., in plants, which given as an axiom in Jaina books is proved by Sir Jagdis Chander Bose, only recently scientifically.
Soul moulds matter. Every pain and adversity can be treated scientifically and surely in accordance with the Karma Philosophy of Jainism.
Hence the necessity of studying the Jaina Karma Philosophy. It is not merely interesting as being of a curious character and great antiquity. It is not important only for the study of the History and evolution of some most important aspects of Philosophy and Religion generally, and particularly of Hindu and Jaina origin. It becomes essential (if it is found to be true) for the diagnosis and cure of, and prescription for our individual, social, moral, economic, political, and religious doubts, difficulties, deficiencies, disputes, troubles, and ailments.
The causes and processes of mundane ailments are adumbrated above. Their remedies, as suggested by Jainism for the last 3,000 years at least, must be of interest and guidance. They are the Eleven stages (Pratimas) of the Householder's Life; and the vows, common to the Householder and the Monk, but followed in a more extended and intensive way by the latter.

11. Pratimas. 1. Darshana (faith).- A true Jaina must have a perfect and intelligent, well-reasoned faith in Jainism, 2. e., he must have a sound knowledge of its doctrines and their applications in life.
2. Vrata (vow)-He must observe the five minor vows (anuVratas), the three guna-vratas, and four shiksha-vratas. To give details: he must not destroy any kind of life, must not tell a lie, must not make use of another person's property without the owner's consent, must be chaste, must limit his necessities of life, and avoid the use of food which involves unnecessary killing of living beings. The three guna-vratas are special vows relating to the limitation and determination of his daily work, food, and enjoyment. The remaining four vows relate to his meditation in the morning, noon, and evening, co his keeping fast on certain days, and to his duty of daily giving charity in the form of knowledge, medicine, comfort, and food.
3. Sámáyika (worship). He must worship regularly in general for forty-eight minutes, three times daily. Worship means selfcontemplation and purifying one's ideas and emotions.
4. Proshadhopavása (fortnightly must fast). He fasts regularly, as a rule, twice a fortnight each lunar month,
5. Sachitta-tyága (abstinence from the flesh of conscious creatures). He refrains from taking fresh vegetables, because they are living.
6. Rátri-bhukta-tyága (abstinence from eating at night). He must not take food at night. There are minute living beings which no amount of light can reveal or disperse, and which must be consumed with meals after sunset.
7. Brahma charya-Celibacy.
8. Árambha-tyága.--Abandonment of merely worldly engagements and occupations.
9-11. The remaining three stages are preparatory to the monk's life. Their names are parigraha-tyága, ani nati-tyága, and ud.
yága, and they enjoin a gradual giving up of the world and retiring into some very quiet place to acquire the knowledge of truth and ultimately to become fit to be a teacher of the path to Liberation.
Vows The vows (vratas) are five, i. e., to be free from
Injury (Himsa), Falsehood (Anrita),

Theft (Steya), Unchastity (Abrahma), and
Worldly attachment (Parigraha). For the fixing of these 5 vows in the mind, there are 5 kinds of meditation (bhávaná), for each of the vows. The 5 meditations for the vow against injury are
1. Vággupti, Preservation of speech; 2. Manogupti, Preservation of mind; 3. Irya, Care in walking; 4. Ádána-nikshepana-samiti, Care in lifting and laying

For the vow against worldly attachment, the 5 meditations are: giving up infatuation (Rága), and hatred (Dvesha) in the pleasing and displeasing worldly objects of the five senses.
The destructive or dangerous and censurable character of the - 5 faults, injury, etc. in this as also in the next world, ought to be meditated upon.
One must also meditate, that the five faults, injury, etc., are pain personified, as they themselves are the veritable wombs of pain. And we must meditate upon the 4 following:
1. Maitri, Benevolence for all living beings (Sattveshu). 2. Pramoda, Delight at the sight of beings, better quali
fied or more advanced than ourselves on the path of
liberation (Guna-adhikshu). 3. Kárunya, Pity, Compassion for Klishyamáneshu, the
afflicted (klishyamáneshu). 4. Mádhyasthya, Tolerance or indifference to those who
are uncivil or ill-behaved (Avinayeshu). For Samvega, (the apprehension of the miseries of the world) and Vairágya, (non-attachment to sense pleasures), we should meditate upon the nature of the world and of our physical body. The world is transitory and not fit for love; and the body is impure and hampering in spiritual progress and therefore should be subordinated to the soul.
Definitions of the 5 Sins. 1. By passional vibrations, the hurting of the vitalities is injury (Himsá).
2. Injury or himsá is to hurt the Pránas or vitalities, through Pramattayoga, i.e., vibration due to the Passions, which agitate the mind, body or speech.
3. Falsehood is to speak hurtful words through Pramattyoga, passional vibrations (Avirati).
4. Theft is to take anything which is not given through Pramattayoga (Steya).
5. Unchastity is coition or sexual contact, through Pramatta. yoga (Abrahmacharya).
Wordly attachment is múrchha, infatuation or intoxication through Pramattoyoga, in the living or non-living objects of the world (Parigraha).
Worldly objects are said to be Parigraha, because they are the external causes of internal attachment
A Vratí or a vower should be without blemish which is like a thorn (shalya) which makes the whole body restless.

These last 4, i. e., Sámáyika, Proshadhopavása, Upabhoga parimana and Atithi Sam vibhága are called Shikshavratas, disciplinary vows, so called because they are preparatory for the discipline of an ascetic's life.
The house-holder is also the observer in the last moments of his life, of the process of Sallekhaná peaceful death which is characterised by non-attachment to the world and by a suppression of the passion.

1. Mithyátva, Wrong belief. Delusion. The thought-activity of the soul due to the operation of the right belief-deluding karmas. In this, the soul does not believe in the right path to Liberation. From the first, i.e., this Guna sthána, the soul goes to the 4th Gunasthána always.
2. Sásádana. Downfall. When there is operation in the 4th stage of one of the 4 Anantánubandhi kashayas, Error-feeding passions, the soul falls down to the first stage through the second a the thought-activity in the passage through, is called Sásádana.
3. Mishra, mixed. Operation of Samyak-mithyátva-mohaniya karmas or Mishra Mohaniya. Belief in right and wrong at one and the same time. This is reached always on falling down from the fourth stage.
4. Avirata-samyaktva. Vowless right-belief. Belief is produced by the Upashma, subsidence of the 4 Anant ánubandhi kashavas. Error-feeding passions and one or three kinds of right-belief. deluding karmas respectively, i. e., one for a soul who has never been. or three, for a soul who has been in possession of Samaktva, right belief. The soul here has belief in the path of Liberation, but cannot observe the rules of conduct for attaining Liberation. Three kinds of thought activity may be noted in this stage:
1. Upashama-samyakta is attained by the Upashama,
Subsidence of 5 or 7 kinds of deluding karmas. 2. Ksháyika samyakta is attained by the destruction of
the 7 prakrities. 3. Kshayopashama samyakta is attained by the destruc
tion or subsidence of 6, and the continuous operation of the 7th, ie. Samyak-prakrti-mithyátva, right-beliefclouded-occasionally-by-the-slightest wrong belief. This kind of thought activity is characterised by 3 defects; i.e.:1. Chala, the defect of being shaken in his right
belief, e. g. thinking that, worship of Shantinátha will bring calmness ; or that of Pársvanátha will remove obstacles, etc., etc., whereas all Arhats are the same.

2. Mala, the defect of having the thought-activity soiled by one or more of the defects or transgressions, e. g., Shanká, doubt; Kánkshá, desire of sense pleasures; Vichikitsa, hatred of the sick and deformed, etc.; Anya-drishti-prashansá. Thinking admiringly of wrong believers; and Anya-dirishti-samstava, Praising wrong believers.
3. Agáḍha, the defect of losing firm hold of right belief, e. g., dedicating a temple and still thinking it to be one's own property.
5.
Desha virata, Partial vows, i.e. taking the Partial vows. All the 11 Pratimas or stages of a layman's life come in this stage. These are given supra, page
6. Pramata virata, imperfect vows, after renunciation of all wordly objects, still occasionally to turn the mind to the service or needs of the body. This is, pramattabháva, careless, slackness in concentration. Henceforth the stages are all in the life of a Muni,
"
Saint.
7. Apramatta virata. Perfect vows, Renouncing the careless, slackness of the 6th gunasthána, and being absorbed in spiritual contemplation (Righteous concentration of the highest type).
From here, there are 2 Shrenis, or ways of ascent; 1. Upashama shrení in which the right-conduct-deluding karma subsides; 2. Kshapaka-shreni, in which it is being destroyed. This last is the necessary way to Moksha, Liberation.
8. Apúrva karana, new-thought-activity, Karana or thoughtactivity which the saint's soul had never yet acquired. This is the beginning of the first Shukladhyána, pure concentration on the pure, Átma or self.
9. Anivritta-karana. advanced thought-activity, special thought activity of a still greater purity. A stage of Prathama Shukladhyana.

10. Súksma-sámparaya, slightest delusion. All passions are destroyed or have subsided, except very slight nominal greed, this is also first Shukladhyána.
11. Upa shánta-moha or Upa-shanta-kasháya, subsided delusion. A thought-activity which is produced by the subsidence of the entire right-conduct-deluding karmas. This is also first Shukladhyána. A saint must fall down from here, but if strong enough, he can resume his ascent from the Kshapaka mode of ascent in the 8th stage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

43
12. Kshina moha, delusionless. The entire right-conduct-deluding karmas are destroyed, in this stage, and the thoughtactivity produced belongs to the 2nd Shukladhyána. The saint attaining this, does so directly from the 10th stage without passing through the 11th stage.
13. Sayoga kevali, Vibrating-Perfect soul. Before commencing this, the soul must have destroyed the three remaining destructive karmas knowledge-obscuring, conation-obscuring and obstructive karmas. Here the soul becomes Arhat or Perfect soul in human body with vibrations in it. Preaching and Peregrinations belong
to this stage.
14. Ayoga-kevali, vibrationless perfect soul. This is attained when there is before the sayoga kevali's Liberation, just enough time to speak out the 5 letters अ ई उ ऋ लृ . In this stage-a very brief one indeed-the vibrations of the holy body cease, and the soul attaining Peace and Bliss, becomes one with itself and leaving the body is called SIDDHA.
Now let us see from what particular kind of the 148 karmas the soul is freed in each stage. This can be caught at a glance from the following table :

(1) The total number of Sub-classes is 148. Of these there are 26 sub-classes which are included in some others of which they are a sort of inseparable accident, and therefore really only 122 distinct sub-classes can come into action at a time. The 26 are as follows:
The body (Sharira) karma is of 5 kinds: Physical, Fluid, Assimilative, Electric, and Karmic. The molecular bondage (Bandhana) and interfusion (Samgháta) is of 5 kinds each. But the bondage and the fusion are entirely dependant on and associated with the 5 bodies. Therefore these 10 may be considered as nondistinct (Aviná-bháví).
The touch, taste, smell, and colour sub-classes are respectively 8, 5, 2, and 5 in number. But each class has a distinct activity, i. e., there are only 4 distinct sub-classes from this view point. Thus 16, may be considered as non distinct.
Deducting the above 10 and 16, i. e. 26 from 148, we get 122 sub-classes.
Out of these 122 distinct sub classes 2, i.e. Clouded-Right-Belief and Mixed-Right-and-Wrong Belief sub-classes cannot be bound in the first stage of wrong belief, where the soul has and can have the bondage by the Wrong Belief Deluding Karma alone. Thus the number of bindable sub classes becomes 120. But the soul in this stage cannot possibly have bondage of Sharira or an Aharaka Assimilative-body; Áharaka- Ángopánga or Assimilative limbs and minor limbs; nor the Tirthankara-body-making-Karma. Deducting these three from the 120, we get 117 as the total number of bindable Karmas in this stage.
(2) The Hellish and Sub-human Age have had their bondageseparation (Bandha Vyuchchhitti) at the end of the first and second stage respectively. But in this stage no agekarma is ever bound; therefore the Human and Celestial Age Sub-classes also must be excluded. At the end of the second stage we had 101-25-76 bindable subclasses. Deducting the 2 from this 76 we get 74. (3) In this stage the human, and Celestial Age and the Tirthankara-body sub-classes can also be bound. Therefore to the above 74 these 3 must be added, making the bindable sub-classes 77.
(4) The Áháraka Sharíra or Assimilative body and the Aháraka Ángopánga or Assimilative limbs and minor limbs sub-classes are bound only here, therefore (63-6)- 57 plus these 2-59 is the bindable total here.




Page #53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

(5) At the end of this stage there is the bondage separation
of the following 16 sub-classes :
(1) Mithyátva, Wrong Belief. (2) Napunsaka veda, Common sex inclination. (3) Narakáyu, Hellish Age. (4) Naraka Gati, Hellish Condition of existence. (5) Ekendriya Gati, One-sensed Genus. (6) Dvendriya Játi, Two (7) Tendriya Játi, Three

That is, the soul which passes from this stage onwards, leaves behind him the liability to be bound by these 16 sub-classes. In the next stage the total number of his bindable sub-classes is
is 117-16 = 101. (6) The following 25 sub-classes cease to be bindable after
this stage. (1) Nidrá-Nidrá, Deep sleep, (2) Prachalá-Prachalá, Deep drowiness. (3) Styánagriddhi, Somanambulism. (4) Anantánubandhi Krodha, Error-feeding Anger, (5)

bindable after the end of this stage. (15) All the bindable sub-classes can become operable in this
stage, therefore the number of operable sub-classes in
this stage is 117. (16) Out of the 117 operable, 5 cease to be operable at the
end of the first stage thus leaying 112. But in this stage the naraka-Anupurvi or hellish migratory form
cannot operate, therefore the total is 111. (17) At the end of the second stage the number of operable
sub-classes was 111-9–102. There is no transmigration in this stage, therefore the 4 migratory sub-classes must be deducted from it. But as the Hellish migratary subclass has already ceased at the end of the first stage, therefore only 3 are to be deducted, leaving 99-(102-3).

But as in this stage there is the operation of the Mixed Right and Wrong Belief Sub-classes, therefore the total of operable sub-classes is 100.
(18) To the above 100 the following 5 have to be added, the 4 migratory sub-classes and the slightly-clouded RightBelief sub-class, and mixed belief is to be directed. Thus there are 104.
(19) At the end of the fifth stage, the operable sub-classes were 87-8-79. To these have to be added the Áháraka Sharira, Assimilative Body and the Áháraka Ángopánga Assimilative Limbs and minor Limbs. Thus making the total 81.
(20) At the end of the twelfth stage the operable sub-classes were 57-16-41. To these the Tirthankar sub-cl ass being added makes the total 42.
(21) At the end of this stage there is an operation separation (Udaya Vyuchchhitti) of the following 5 sub-classes which cease to operate in the soul in any further state. (1) Wrong Belief. (2) Átápa.

CHAPTER 1.
Description of the Prakriti or Nature of Karmas.
पणमिय सिरसा रोमिं गुणरयणविभूसणं महावीरं । सम्मत्तरयणणिलयं पयाडसमुत्तिणं वोच्छं ॥ १ ॥ प्रणम्य शिरसा नेमिं गुणरत्नविभूषणं महावीरम् । सम्यक्त्वरत्ननिलयं प्रकृतिसमुत्कीर्तनं वक्ष्यामि ॥ १ ॥
1. Having bowed with the head to Lord Nemi, (who is) adorned with the jewels of the pure soul's attributes, a great hero, (and) a mine of the gem of right-belief, I shall speak of the description of the Prakriti or nature of Karmas.
पयडी सील सहावो जीवंगाणं अरणाइसंबंधो । कोवले मलं वा तारणस्थित्तं सयं सिद्धं ॥ २ ॥ प्रकृतिः शीलं स्वभावः जीवाङ्गयोरनादिसम्बन्धः । कनकोपले मलं वा तयोरस्तित्वं स्वयं सिद्धम् ॥ २ ॥
2. The eternal bondage of soul and Karmic matter is their nature, “Prakriti", "Shila", "Svabhava". The existence (of soul and Karmas ) is self-proved (as) the dirt in golden ore.
Commentary.
The union of soul and matter is self-proved. This is the first point from which Jainism starts. This corresponds to the mighty and pregnant division of all things into Jíva and Ajíva, i. e., living and non-living, or soul and non-soul. Soul always, and soul

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
alone, has consciousness. It alone is living, i. e., is Jiva. All else is non-soul, non-living, devoid of consciousness, which never had and never shall have consciousness, and is incapable of being conscious. Everything that is not Jiva is without consciousness. Pure soul is pure consciousness. Pure non-soul is without consciousness, or without any semblance of consciousness. This is not a merely logical division, convenient for analysis, arrangement or exposition. It is a basic fact. It must be thoroughly understood. Any error or doubt about this will certainly vitiate one's understanding of Truth. The duality of a human being is obvious. My nails are different from my idea of Shakespeare, or my ambition of being a worthy citizen of my country. The nail detached from me is dead matter. Not so the idea of Poetry or Patriotism. A still finer observation may be made. Life means a grouping together of so many vitalities, é. o. those faculties which enable me to apprehend objects by means of my senses, or to sense my own powers of body, speech and mind, or my respiration. These vitalities exist in me, but not in dead matter. Every fact in life, to the truly observant soul, cries out in a most unmistakeable tone the message of this inherent and inevitable mundane duality. There is Life. There is Lifelessness. We see it in every thing. We see it around us. We see it in us. It is only the man imbued with a philosophy, in the phrase of Hume, "subversive of all speculation”, who blinds himself to the obvious existence of these two facts, or who by looking too long and too intently and exclusively only upon one of these, thinks fit to apotheosize the one and to deny the other. Of this one-sided lattitude are born the pure materialists and the pure spiritualists, typified by the Chárvákas and the Vedantists of India respectively. For one, all is matter; for the other, all is soul. Thus at the very outset, Jainism sounds a clarion note of dissent from these one
ews of Truth. It takes its stand on the plurality of the aspects of Truth, and teaches us that both the materialists and the spiritualists are correct, but only partially. Certainly ; there is matter, there is Ajiva ; thus Chárváka is right and the Vedantist wrong. There is also Spirit, there is Jiva; thus Vedantism is true, and Chárváka wrong. We must see both, as both are obvious. Take only one broad common phenomenon of death. John dies. The whole of John does not disappear. His body is there. His vitality is not. He is not there; he has gone from the body. That he' who has gone from the body and who when he was with it and in it, made it alive', is the true John, the Jíva who was called John, according to Jainism. The body which he wore and which

he dropped or left on death is the other partner in the firm of soul and matter; it is Ajiva. And still though the fact of this duality, this universal union of Jíva and Ajiva is obvious, yet its full grasp and thorough comprehension are far from easy. A beautiful little book by the author of Gommatasára himself gives us as clear a notion of Jiva, as any can be obtained in the peculiar and natural circumstances of things. The reader is referred to Dravya samgraha*, where in Gatha 2, the 9 chief characteristics of the soul are enumerated, and each of them elaborated in the succeeding Gathas. But here the point to be realised clearly is this, that matter -one of the 5 chief forms of Ajiva-is in union with soul, the only living and conscious substance. Lifeless matter is found united with living soul. The whole Drama of life is played or danced together by the living soul being in close grasp of lifeless matter. Lifeless space is the stage ; Lifeless Time is the duration; and lifeless Dharma and Adharma, the indespensable assistants for the dancers to move or to rest. The exercise of dancing is their eternal movement in the cycle of mundane existences. At each step, the momentum for a new movement is gained. At each embrace of matter, the delighted deluded soul throbs and vibrates for a fresh embrace. Wily matter is ever ready to attack the soul and to flow into it with its million insinuations and to keep alive and vigorous the bondage of the living by the non-liying. The inflow of the non-living matter into the living soul is called Ásrava; the bondage is Bandha. The stoppage of Ásrava is Samvara ; the release of bondage is Nirjará; the total Liberation of the living from the bondage of the non-living is Moksha. The 7 Tattvas or Principles of Jainism are treated in Umásvámi's Tattvártha Sutrat, to which the reader is referred for further information about them. The activity of the soul which invites and enables matter to flow into it, as also the matter which actually does flow into the soul, is technically called Karma, The thought activity is Bháva-Karma ; the actual matter flowing into the soul and binding it is Dravya-Karma. This book--the Karma-Kánda of Gommatasára deals with Karmas, their incidence, kinds, etc,
Notice also that in the world, all souls are always found united with matter. Pure souls abide only in Siddhakshetra, the Abode of the Liberated. In universal space, souls are from eternity subject to the bondage of matter. The Panchastikaya of Shri Kunda Kundáchárya, talking of such souls, tells us in Gatha 27 : See Dravya Samgraha (1917) by S. C. Ghoshal, M. A., Sacred Books of the
Jainas, Vol. I. See Tattvarthadhigma Sutra, S. B. J., Vol. II by Jaini.

जीवोत्ति हवदि घेदा उवोगविसेसिदो पहूकत्ता । भोत्तायदेहमत्तो णहि मुत्तो कम्म संजुत्तो॥
Jiva (mundane soul) is (always) combined with Karmas. This bondage of Karmas is from eternity, but when once it is broken and Liberation attained, then it is destroyed totally and for ever. Of course the matter of the bondage is freely and constantly being changed; but the fact and condition of the bondage of Jíva by Ajiva persist through all these changes. Old Karmic matter is shed ; and new assumed; but there never has been a moment when the mundane soul was free from its vestment of Karmic matter.
देहोदयेण सहिओ जीवो आहरदि कम्म णोकम्म। पडिसमयं सव्वंगं तत्तायसपिंडओव्व जलं ॥३॥ देहोदयेन सहितो जीव आहरति कर्म नोकर्म । प्रतिसमयं सर्वाङ्गं तप्तायः पिंडमिव जलम् ॥ ३ ॥
3. By the operation of the body sub-class of bodymaking Karma the soul attracts Karmic and quasi-Karmic (physical molecules) every instant to the whole body as a hot iron ball (draws in) water (from all sides).
Commentary. The soul united with the body, is constantly taking in material molecules to renew and build its Karmic and two other bodies. Karmic molecules build up the Karmic body; and the physical molecules build up the other physical bodies.
In all there are 5 possible bodies of a mundane soul (1) Audárika, the external physical body, (2) Vaikriyika, fluid body of the celestial and hellish beings, (3) Áháraka, the assimilative body in which a saint's soul flashes to an omniscient to resolve some doubt, (4) Taijasa, electric body, (5) Kármana, Karmic body. These are all material. The molecules of which they are formed are of 2 kinds. (1) Karma-vargana of which the Karmic body is made. (2) No-karma-varganá, of which the other bodies are made. The no-karma varganá is of 2 kinds,* Taijasa varganá, of which the electric body is formed ; and the Áháraka varganá, of which the external physical, fluid and áháraka bodies are made. Every embodied soul has at least 3 bodies, the Karmic, the electric and either
* 23 kinds of matter vargans are mentioned in Gommatagara, Jiva Kanda gatha 694 -- 595, pages 294--295.

the fluild or the external physical body. Sometimes it has 4, for one antar-muhúrta, when the Áháraka body emanates from a saint in doubt. And in transmigration, i. e., its passage from one to another condition of existence, the soul has only 2 bodies --i.e., the Karmic and the electric.
All these bodies are in form like the external body occupied by the soul; they are all co-extensive. Except that the Áháraka body is human in form but in size of a length equal to the forearm of the saint himself, i. e., from the elbow to the tip of his middle finger.
The fluid body also, although it is changeable at will, is yet one to begin with, and its identity persists throughout life. सिद्धाणंतिमभागं अभव्वसिद्धादणंतगुणमेव। समयपबद्धं बंधदि जोगवसादो दु विसरित्थं ॥४॥ सिद्धानन्तिमभागं अभव्यसिद्धादनन्तगुणमेव । समयप्रबद्धं बध्नाति योगवशात्तु विसदृशम् ॥ ४॥
4. An infinite part of the number of Liberated souls (which is also infinite), and infinite times the number of souls, incapable of becoming liberated is the (maximum and minimum respectively) of unit of bondage, or the number of molecules (which the soul) binds (to itself) in one instant, owing to the soul's vibratory activity (intense or mild). But (the number of molecules is) unequal; (i.e., sometimes more and at other less are bound).
Commentary. Instant-bondage, Samaya Prabaddha, is the number of Karmic or no-Karmic molecules bound by the soul in one instant. Henceforth we call it the unit of Bondage or Instant-bondage.
जीरदि समयपबद्धं पोगदो णेगसमयबद्धं वा । गुणहाणीण दिवट्ठे समयपबद्धं हवे सत्तं ॥ ५॥ जीर्यते समयप्रबद्धं प्रयोगतः अनेकसमयबद्धं वा । गुणहाणीनां द्वर्द्ध समयप्रबद्धं भवेत् सत्त्वम् ॥ ५ ॥
5. One unit of bondage is shed (every instant); and many units of bondage (are shed in one instant) by effort (i.e., austerities, etc). The one and one-half of Gunahani's

(multiplied) by unit of bondage represent the molecules which remain bound to the soul.
Commentary.
Note
Gunaháni (G) is the number of terms of a series, the sum of which is the number of molecules of a unit of Bondage, (M. U. B.) and each term in which is half of the term immediately preceding it.
Gunaháni-á-yáma, (G. A.) is the number of instants (Samayas) in one Gunaháni.
aayuga náná gunahánis is the group of gunahánis in one Unit of Bondage.
Anyonyá-bhyasta-ráshi-2 raised to the power of
the number of gunahánis in one Unit of Bondage. Duration of Bondage (S). Thus gunaháni-áyáma number of gunahánis.
E.g. If 48 samayas is the duration of Units of Bondage, and 6 is the number of gunahánis, then gunaháni-áyáma-48-8.
Here náná-gunaháni-the group of 6 gunahánis.
Anyonyá bhyastaráshi here-26-64. This minus one, being the divisor of the number of a Unit of Bondage gives us the last term of the series.
E.g. If a Unit of Bondage have 6300 molecules, then the last
6300
term is 64-1
-100.
Thus the series of 6 gunahánis here is.
3200+ 1600 + 800+ 400+200+ 100-6300.
In the example given above, the soul which binds in one instant 6300 molecules, of a duration of 48 samayas and of 6 gunahánis, will shed 3200 molecules in the 1st 8 samayas.

Chaya (C) is the regular arithmetic difference between any consecutive two of the terms of the series of a gunaháni. Chaya is the molecules of a gunaháni divided by
nishekahára + No. of gunaháni áyáma + 1x gunaháni áyáma.

Thus in the 4th 8 samayas in the above example, 400 molecules are shed. We want to find out how many molecules are shed in the 1st samaya, and by how many molecules the shedding becomes less and less in each suceeeding samaya.
To find out the molecules shed in the 1st samaya, i. B., F we apply the formula.
F-4M__4* 400 4+ 400 1600

6 Therefore the number of molecules shed in the 4th set of 8 samayas will be 64, 60, 56, 52, 48, 44, 40 and 36-400.
If in one instant, the soul binds 6300 molecules of a duration of 48 instants then they are shed as follows :

6. From the point of view of Karma-ness (Karma is) of one kind. As dravya Karma (karmic matter) and bháva Karma ( its capacity of fruition ) it is of 2 kinds. But the material aggregate of Karmic molecules is dravya Karma; its power to operate is bháva Karma.
Commentary.
When a Karma for example, the knowledge-obscuring-Karma, operates and the intellect begins to act perversely, we call that perversity a bháva Karma. Here we call the effect, by the name of cause. The bháva Karma is really the power in the knowledgeobscuring-Karma to operate and it is slightly figurative to call the result of this operation as bháva Karma.

13. The conduct of the soul coming down from genea ration to generation is called Gotra (family). High and low conduct becomes high and low Gotra. (The Karma which determines high and low family for the birth of soul is called family-determining or Gotra Karma).

15. (The soul) conates things, knows (them by the 7 kinds of Syádváda or Predication) and then believes (them). So conation and knowledge (and) belief are the Soul's qualities.

16. Being the highest attribute of the soul, the first (place is given to) knowledge. After that certainly comes conation. (Right) belief after that. Power relates to soul and non-soul both, therefore (it comes) last.
This gatha explains and justifies the order in which the Destructive Karmas are enumerated in Jainism.

The Obstructive Karma is put after the non-destructive Karmas, (because) even though Destructive, (it is) like the non-destructive, incapable of destroying fully (the powers of the soul), (and operates) with the auxiliary help of the trinity body-making (family-determining, and feeling Karmas).

High and low family depends on condition of existence; therefore the body-making-karma (is mentioned) before the family-determining Karma.
घार्दिव वेयणीयं मोहस्स बलेण घाददे जीवं । इदि घादीणं मज्झे मोहस्सादिम्हि पढिदं तु ॥ १६॥ घातिवत् वेदनीयं मोहस्य बलेन घातयति जीवम् । इति घातीनां मध्ये मोहस्यादौ पठितं तु ॥ १६ ॥
19. The Feeling Karma by the force of the Deluding Karma destroys like the Destructive-Karmas the (real character of the) soul. Therefore it is placed in the middle of the Destructive (Karmas) and before the Deluding (Karma).

It is called nondestructive, because its operation is limited to bringing about occasions for pleasure and pain. The realizing of pleasure and pain, depends upon the soul's attention and indulgence and ennui. If the soul is non-attentive to such occasions, and is not influenced by them, the Feeling-Karma though operative, cannot disturb the thoughtactivity of the soul.

As (is) the nature of these, so also the (8) Karmas should be known ( respectively).

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
The 93 include 5 kinds of bodies, i. e., the physical, fluid, áháraka, electric and Karmic. Here, in gatha 27 (q. v.) 15 kinds of bodies are given as the sub-classes of these 5. Thus 10 more are added to 93 to make up 103.

23. By the operation of somnambulism even on being awakened the man goes on sleeping, ( although he) per - forms actions, (and) speaks. And by the operation of deep sleep he is not able to open his eyes (even when awakened).

24. And by the operation of heavy drowsiness the salva flows out, and the limbs move. By the operation of sleep the man, who is going, stops, and then sits down, or falls down.

25. And by the operation of drowsiness the soul sleeps with half-open eyes, and even when sleeping has a broken, discontinuous, partial, knowledge and again and again sleeps a little.

26. As in a machine, bird-seed (being ground takes 3 forms, husk, corn and powder); so in the machine of (the thought-activity of) the first subsidential right-belief the matter of wrong-belief also (becomes of) 3 kinds; and each one is innumerably less in material Karmic molecules (than the one proceeding it).
Commentary.
Subsidential right-belief is of 2 kinds. Prathamopashamasamyaktva, the first subsidential right-belief. It may arise (1) in a soul which has never had right-belief, by the subsidence of the 4 error-feeding Passions and Wrong-belief, i. e., the 4 Anantánubandhí Kasháyas and Mithyátva; or (2) in a soul which has had, but has lost right-belief, by the subsidence of the above 5 and of the 2 samyaktva mithyátva, mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, and samyaktva Prakriti, right-belief-clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief.
Dvitiyopashama-Samyaktva, the second-subsidential-right-belief. It arises in a saint in the 7th spiritual stage of Perfect Vows. When this saint is preparing to pass on to the 8th stage of New Thought-activity along the line of subsidential advancement, having been already a right-believer of the destruction-subsidence kind, he transforms the nature of the 4 error-feeding Passions into lesser Passions, and causes the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes of rightbelief-deluding-Karma, namely, Mithyátya, Samyaktva Mithyátva, and Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyátva. The right-belief of this saint is called the second-subsidential right-belief.
Wrong-belief is of three kinds, Mithyátva, Wrong-belief, Samyaktva-Mithyátva, mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, Samyaktva Prakriti-Mithyátva, right-belief-clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief.

The matter of wrong-belief Karma, by being subjected to the thought activity of the First-subsidential right-belief becomes of the above 3 kinds. Wrong-belief has the largest number of molecules. Mixed-right-and-wrong belief has a number of molecules innumerably less than that. And right-belief-clouded by-slightwrong-belief innumerably less than those of mixed-right-and wrong-belief.

27. The electric and karmic (bodies) with (the other) three; the electric with the Karmic; the karmic with another karmic; (the bodies) thus combining (we get) four, four, four, two, and one sub-classes (of the 5 bodies). Commentary.
The 15 are these: 1. Physical-physical;
2. Physical-electric; 3. Physical-Karmic. 4. Physical-electric-Karmic. 5. Fluid-fluid; 6. Fluid-electric;
7. Fluid-karmic; 8. Fluid
electric-karmic.
9. Áháraka-áháraka; 10. Áháraka-electric; 11. Áháraka-karmic; 12. Áháraka-electric-karmic.
13. Electric-electric; 14. Electric-karmic. 15. Karmic-karmic.
These 15 are the names of the sub-classes of the body-making Karmas, by the operation of which respectively, a physical body is produced from another physical body; an electric body from a physical body; and so on. These 15 are illustrated as follows:
1. In a Chakravarti, who has 96000 wives, his original physical body is reserved for his chief wife. But for the others, he produces by the operation of this Karma 95999 physical bodies. Of course the soul remains the same, although it employs all the 96000 bodies simultaneously.
2. In a saint, in anger or compassion, the electric body which issues from the left or right shoulder is due to the operation of this Karma. Note that although he has got an electric body also, but the electric body which he throws forth from his shoulders is said to be produced by the operation of his physical-electric sub-class of body-making Karma, because the vibratory-activity of the soul which results in the operation of this particular sub-class is produced by the physical body mainly. Thus the Yoga or Vibratory-activity which produces the electric body, being physical, the Karmic sub-class is called physical-electric. Note also that these bodies

GOMMATASARA.
17
which are produced are made up of fresh molecules, and are not divisions or offshoots of the physical, electric and Karmic bodies already possessed by the saint.
3. At the approach of death, a Karmic body is produced to go and sort-of-touch the place where the soul is to reincarnate.
4. At the approach of death of a saint in compassion, both the electric and Karmic bodies issue simultaneously for their different purposes.
5 to 8. Apply to celestial and hellish beings. Celestial beings never travel out, in the body in which they are born ; but they send out one or more fluid, etc. bodies by the operation of these 4 subclasses of body-making Karmas. Note that the hellish beings merely transform the matter of their own fluid body into another form. Their fluid electric Karma operates in anger only.
9 to 12. Apply to the Kháraka body. Somehow if it has not fulfilled its mission in its appointed duration, the saint issues out another Áháraka from the previous one. This is done by the operation of the 9th sub-class, Áháraka-áháraka. The 10th is, where an electric body is produced from the áháraka, e. g., to protect or extricate a saint from some trouble or difficulty. The 11th is when the saint is about to die and is in doubt also. The 12th is where the circumstances of the 10th and 11th co-exist.
13. Electric-electric. If one electric body has failed to complete its mission in its appointed time, then another is produced from the same.
14. When the Karmic is produced from an electric body. 15. The Karmic body produces another Karmic body. णलया बाहू य तहा णियंबपुट्ठी उरो य सीसो य । अद्वैव दु अंगाई देहे सेसा उवंगाइं ॥२८॥ नलको बाहू च तथा नितम्बपृष्ठे उरश्च शीर्ष च । अष्टैव तु अङ्गानि देहे शेषाणि उपाङ्गानि ॥ २८ ॥
28. The two legs and the two arms and the buttocks, the back, and the chest, and the head-these 8 are the only limbs in the body; the others are minor limbs (as the eye, etc., etc.),

29. By (the 6th, i. e., Sripáțiká) osseous structure (in which there are no peculiar joints but only ligatures) the soul goes from the first to the 4 pairs of heavens, (i. e., up to the 8th heaven Kápishtha). And those of (the 5th), Kilita (small joints and bones) and of (4th) Ardha-nárácha (big joints on one side and bones) respectively go further to two pairs each (of the heavens).
Commentary.
The soul with 6th osseous structure can go up to the 8th heaven, but not beyond.
The soul with 5th osseous structure can go up to the 12th heaven, but not beyond.
The soul with 4th osseous structure can go up to the 16th heaven, but not beyond.

31. The rational being with 6 osseous structures goes up to Megha (the third hell). (The one with) five, four, and one osseous structure excepting Sripáţiká, etc., also goes beyond that up to fifth, sixth and seventh hells respectively.
Commentaryo. Only beings with the highest osseous structure can sin so deeply that they merit the tortures of the lowest or the 7th hell. That is, they alone can go down to the 7th hell. Those with four, i.e., the first four osseous structures, i. e. with all except Kilita and Sripátika go down to the 6th. Those with 5,i.e., all except Sripatika, can go down to the 5th. Those with all the 6 structures of bone can go down to the third hell. For the 6 kinds of Samhanana, see Tattvártha Sútra Chapter 8.

32. And the last 3 osseous structreus appear in the women of work-region (Karma-bhúmi); the first three osseous structures are not (found in them). So it has been said by the Conquerors.
Commentary. Females of work region have only the last 3 osseous structures, and no higher ones. Therefore they can not go beyond the 16th heaven, as stated in Gatha 29. Only those who possess the first osseous structure, Vajra-Vrishabha-Naracha Samhanana, can attain Liberation. Females of work region do not possess this structure, and therefore they can not attain Liberation from female bodies.

38. 5, 9, 2, 28, 4, 67, 2, and 5 are respectively said to be the sub-classes of Karmas in operation (Udaya).
Commentary. The order is the same as in Gatha 35. The total is 122. The two deluding sub-classes which do not bind, but operate, viz., Samyaktva mithyátva and Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyátva are included here. See Gatha 26.

Commentary. Of the 148 sub-classes, the 2 mentioned in Gatha 26 never bind, therefore 146 can bind ; but as said in Gatha 35, only 120 form the subject-matter of bondage. Also as operative there are only 122 as in Gatha 36, although all the 148 may operate. पंच णव दोगिण अट्ठावीसं चउरो कमेण तेणउदी। दोषण य पंच य भणिया एदाओ सत्तपयडीओ ॥३८॥

38. 5, 9, 2, 28, 4, 93, 2, and 5 respectively are said to be the sub-classes of (Karmic molecules) in Attendance (or Existence, Sattá).
Commentary. Under the influence of vibratory activity, and passions, Karmic molecules are attracted to, and bound with, a mundane soul, for a period. This is Bondage, Bandha. So long as they remain in Bondage, without coming into operation, they are said to be in attendance, Sattá. During the period, they gradually come into operation, and shed off. This is called their operation, Udaya. In all these changes, there always remains a body of Karmic molecules attendant upon the soul. It is called Sattá. Sattá may be roughly compared to a stream of running water. Within a particular area of the river, the water remains more or less the same in volume, although it is changing every moment as to the material water which is constantly flowing away. The volume which is more or less constant is like Sattá. Of course the Karmas in Sattá fall off by austerities, etc. or on maturity. There are 148 sub-classes of attendant Karmic molecules.

(Include) mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, Samyaktva-mithátva, also for the non-bondage (enumeration, i. e, in operation and attendance).

and operation, taken individually (these are) 98 (and) 100; (and) not taken individually, (they are) 82 (and) 84 (respectively).
Commentary. The demeritorious sub-classes are in total-47+1+1+1+4+4+5 +5+20+1+1+10-100, with reference to operation. In bondage, 2vix.
mixed-right-and-wrong-belief, and right-belief-clouded-by-slightwrong belief are excluded, as they do not bind; and therefore the total with reference to bondage, is 98.
If not taken in all their individual sub-classes, we must exclude 16 out of the 20 sub-classes of the 4, colour, taste, smell and touch; then we have the above totals reduced to 84 and 82 respectively.
The 10 immobile, etc., are Sthávara, Súkshma, Aparyaptí Sádharana sharira, Asthira, Ashubha, Durbhaga, Duhsvara, Anadeya, Ayashah-kirti.

45. The first, etc., (i. e., the error-feeding, partial and total-vow-preventing and perfect-right-conduct-preventing) passions, destroy or obscure (respectively) rightbelief, partial, total, (and) perfect right-conduct, and the remaining (9) passions (hásya, risible, etc,) have the qualities indicated by their names.
Commentary. Four error-feeding passions prevent right-belief arising in the soul. Four partial-vow-preventing Karmas, when operating do not allow a soul to adopt vows of a layman. Four total-vow-preventing Karmas in their operation prevent a soul from following rightconduct of saints, while four perfect-vow-preventing passions and nine quasi-passions obscure perfect right-conduct.

47. From the body sub-class (of the body-making Karma) to the touch (sub-class of Karma) fifty; Nirmána (formation of limbs and minor limbs); the pairs of Atápa (hot and cold light), of Sthira (steady and not steady), and of Shubha (beautiful, and ugly), the Pratyeka pair (bodies with one or more souls); the Agurulaghu three (neitherlight-nor-heavy, self-destructive, and other-destructive organ, or limbs),-(these 62 are) Pudgala vipákí, i. e. Body-maturing.
Commentary.
These are called Pudgala-vipákí, because they mainly affect the material bodies and their constituents.
The 50 body, etc., prakritis are as follows:
5 bodies, 5 molecular bondage, 5 molecular interfusion, 6 figures of body, 6 physical constitutions, 3 limbs and minor limbs, 20 colour smell, taste and touch.

Commentary. Of the 148 sub-classes of Karma, 62 out of 93 of body-making Karmas, have been already described as pudgala-vipaki. 4 of the age-class are called as Bhava vipaki, because they operate to produce and keep the particular condition of existence of a soul. 4 Anupurvi sub-classes of body-making Karma, are termed Kshetravipákví, because they operate to maintain the form of the previous body, during the transmigratory passage from one condition of existence to another. The remaining 78 mainly affect the characteristics of the soul and are hence called Jiva-Vipákí.

51. (The four) conditions of existence, (the five) genera, respiration, (graceful and awkward) motion, the three pairs, mobile (and immobile, gross and fine, developable and non-developable), the 4 pairs, amiable (and unprepossessing, sweet and harsh voice, impressive and nonimpressive, fame and notoriety) and Tirthakara-these (are) the twenty-seven.
Commentary. The 27 sub-classes named in gatha 50, have, in this gatha, been described again in due order, and a little greater detail.

52. (There) are four aspects (Nikshepa or Nyása) of Karma :-(by) name, or negative (Náma), representation or representative (Sthápaná), privation or privative (Dravya), present or positive (Bhava). Prakriti (Nature of Karmic matter), Pápa (demerit), Karma (Karma), Mala (dirt), these terms (are ascribed) to the dirt (of Karmas) from the aspect of their names. See Tátvártha Sútra, S. B. J. Vol. II. Chapter 1, Sútra 5, pp. 8-15.

सदृशासदृशे द्रव्ये मतिना जीवस्थितं खलु यत्कर्म । तदेतदिति प्रतिष्ठा स्थापना तत्स्थापनाकमें ॥ ५३ ॥
53. Representation of Karma, which is in combination with the soul, by similar or dissimilar object by the intellect, establishing (its identity), that it is that, is the representation (Sthápaná, aspect) of Karma.
दव्वे कम्मं दुविहं आगमणोआगमंति तप्पढमं । कम्मागमपरिजाणुगजीवो उवजोगपरिहीणो ॥ ५४॥ द्रव्ये कर्म द्विविधमागमनोभागममिति तत्प्रथमम् । कमागमपरिज्ञायकजीव उपयोगपरिहीनः॥५४॥
54. The privation (aspect) of Karmas(is) of two kinds. Attention-privation of Karma (Ágama-dravya-karma) and quasi-attention-privation of Karma (No-ágama Dravya Karma). The soul, knower of the scripture about Karmas, (but) without attention (to it is) the first (i. e., attentionprivation of Karma).
जाणुगसरीर भवियं तव्वदिरित्तं तु होदि जं बिदियं । तत्थ सरीरं तिविहं तियकालगयंति दो सुगमा ॥ ५५॥ ज्ञायकशरीरं भावि तद्व्यतिरिक्तं तु भवति यद्वितीयम् । तत्र शरीरं त्रिविधं त्रयकालगतमिति द्वे सुगमे ॥ ५५॥
55. The second (quasi-attention-privation aspect of Karma, No-agama Dravya Karma Nikshepa) is (of 3 kinds). The knowers' body (Jnayaka sharira), future (body, Bhavi), other-than-these-two (Tadvyatirikta). Of these (the knower's) body (is) of 3 kinds with reference to the three times, (past, present, and future). Of these, two (i. e., present body of the knower at the present time (Vartamána Jnayaka Sharira) and the future body (Anāgata Jnayaka Sharira), are easy (to understand).

भूतं तु च्युतं च्याषितं त्यक्तमिति त्रेधा च्युतं स्वपाकेन । पतितं कदलीघातपरित्यागेनोनं भवति ॥ ५६ ॥
56. Past (body is) of three kinds expired (chyuta), cast off (chyávita), renounced (Tyakta). Expired (Chyuta, means that which) drops by itself on maturity (of age Karma). (It) is without premature death (Kadali-gháta) and death by renunciation विसवेयणरत्तक्खयभयसत्थग्गहणसंकिलेसेहिं । उस्सासाहाराणं णिरोहदो छिज्जदे आऊ ॥ ५७॥ विषवेदनारक्तक्षय भयशस्त्रघातसंक्लेशैः। उच्छ्वासाहारयोः निरोधतः छिद्यते श्रायुः॥ ५७ ॥
57. In premature death (Kadalí-gháta), age (áyukarma) is cut short by poison, anguish (Vedaná), consumption (Rakta Kshaya), terror (Bhaya), stroke of (deadly) weapon (Shastra-gháta), (extreme) distress (Sanklesha), suffocation, and starvation.
कदलीघादसमेदं चागविहीणं तु चइदमिदि होदि। घादेण अघादेण व पडिदं चागेण चत्तमिदि ॥ ५८ ॥ कदलीघातसमेतं त्यागविहीनं तु त्यक्तमिति भवति । घातेन अघातेन वा पतितं त्यागेन त्यक्तमिति ॥ ५८ ॥ .
58. Cast off (body Chyávita-sharíra) is associated with premature death (Kadali-ghata), but without renunciation. Renounced (Tyakta body) is that which falls off on renunciation, with, or without, premature death.

59. The modes of food-renunciation (Bhakta Pratijná), self-service (Inginí), no service (Práyopa.gamana);

these (are) the three modes of renouncing (the body). And food-renunciation (is of 3 kinds, minimum, medium and maximum.
भत्तपइण्णाइविही जहएणमंतो मुहुत्तयं होदि । बारसवरिसा जेहा तम्मज्झे होदि मज्झिमया ॥६०॥ भक्तप्रतिज्ञादिविधिः जघन्योऽन्तर्मुहूर्त्तको भवति । द्वादशवर्षा ज्येष्ठः तन्मध्ये भवति मध्यमकः ॥६०॥
60. The food-renunciation mode is of one antarmuhúrta in its minimum, twelve years in its maximum (duration). (The time) between them is (the duration of) medium (mode).
Commentary, Food-renunciation is a mode of ending life with tranquility, while firmly observing the vows of control. It is only adopted when it is ascertained that the body has become se weak that it cannot safely follow the adopted vows. Then the religious person, be he a saint or layman, considers it better to cast off his body instead of breaking the rules of control which he had adopted before,
अप्पोवयारवेक्खं परोवयारूणमिंगिणीमरणं । सपरोवयारहीणं मरणं पाओवगमणमिदि॥६१॥
आत्मोपकारापेक्षं परोपकारोनमिङ्गिनीमरणम् । स्वपरोपकारहीनं मरणं प्रायोपगमनमिति ॥ ६१ ॥
61. Serving ones' needs oneself without service from others (is) death by self-service (Ingini Marana). Death without self-service, (or service) by others, (is) death by no-service (Práyopa-gamana).

knower (Bhávi-Jnáyaka Sharíra). It has been described thus.
तव्वदिरित्तं दुविहं कम्मं गोकम्ममिदि तर्हि कम्मं । कम्मसरुवेणागय कम्मं दव्वं हवे शियमा ॥ ६३ ॥ तद्व्यतिरिक्तं द्विविधं कर्म नोकर्मेति तस्मिन् कर्म । कर्मस्वरूपेणागतं कर्म द्रव्यं भवेन्नियमात् ॥ ६३ ॥
63. Karma and quasi-Karma (No-Karma) are the two kinds, besides these. Of these, Karma is necessarily the Karmic matter which has assumed the form of Karmas. Commentary.
Karmic matter which was bound before and is now attendant for operation in future time is called Karma-privative aspect.
कम्मद्दव्वादण्णं दव्वं गोकम्मदव्वमिदि होदि ।
भावे कम्मं दुविहंगमणोगमंति हवे ॥ ६४ ॥ कर्मद्रव्यादन्यद्रव्यं नोकर्मद्रव्यामिति भवति । भावे कर्मद्विविधमागमनोआगममिति भवेत् ॥ ६४ ॥
64 Matter other than Karmic matter is quasi-Karmic matter. In the positive (Bháva-aspect) Karma is of two kinds now-attentive (ágama bháva Karma), now-quasiattentive (no ágama Bháva-Karma).
Commentary.
Quasi-Karmic matter in its privative aspect is what would be produced by the operation of a particular attendant Karma, and would stimulate the operation of Karmas.
कम्मागमपरिजाणगजीवो कम्मागमम्हि उवजत्तो । भावागमकम्मोत्ति य तस्स य सण्णा हवे यिमा ॥ ६५ ॥ कर्मागमपरिज्ञायकजीवः कर्मागमे उपयुक्तः ।
भावागमकर्मेति च तस्य च संज्ञा भवेन्नियमात् ॥ ६५ ॥
65. The soul, who knows the Karma scriptures and (is) attentive to the Karma scriptures is necessarily named now-attentive-to-the-Karma scriptures (Bhávágama - Karma).

66. And the soul enjoying the fruition of Karma is the now-quasi-attentive (No-ágama Bháva Karma). Thus briefly Karma necessarily is of 4 aspects.
मूलुत्तरपयडीणं णामादी एवमेव णवरितु। सगणामेण य णामं ठवणा दवियं हवे भावो ॥६७॥ मूलोत्तरप्रकृतानां नामादय एवमेव नवरि तु। स्वकनाना च नाम स्थापना द्रव्यं भवेत् भावः ॥ ६७ ॥
67. Similarly the (eight) primary, and (148) secon. dary divisions (should be considered) with reference to (the four aspects), name, etc. But each has its name, representation, privation, and positive-aspect, according to its connotation.
मूलुत्तरपयडीणं णामादि चउव्विहं हवे सुगमं । वजित्ता णोकम्म णोआगमभावकम्मं च ॥ ६८॥ मूलोत्तरप्रकृतीनां नामादि चतुर्विधं भवेत्सुगमम् । वर्जयित्वा नोकर्म नोागमभावकर्म च ॥ ६८॥
68. The 4 aspects, name, etc., of primary and second. ary divisions are easy (to understand), except the quasiKarma and now-quasi-attentive Karma.
Commentary. The author will describe in the following gathas the quasiKarma, i. e., that matter which will be an auxiliary cause for the operation of any particular Karma bound with a soul.
पडपडिहारसिमज्जा आहारं देह उच्चणीचंगं । भंडारी मूलाणं णोकम्मं दवियकम्मं तु ॥ ६६ ॥

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
पटप्रतीहारासिमद्यानि भाहारं देह उच्चनीचाङ्गम् । भाण्डारी मूलानां नोकर्म द्रव्यकर्म तु ॥ ६६ ॥
69. The quasi-Karma of the (8) primary objective Karmas is (respectively, as it were) a curtain, gate-keeper, sword, wine, food, body, high and low constitution, (and) treasurer.
Commentary. Outward cause, i. e., quasi-Karmic matter, for operation of knowledge-obscuring Karma is, as it were, a curtain, thrown across an object which obstructs clear knowledge; for the operation of conation-obscuring Karma it is, as it were a gate-keeper, who stops a visitor from an interview ; for feeling Karma it is like licking honey from the edge of a sword, which will occasion a feeling of pleasure and pain both; for deluding Karma it is like taking wine. QuasiKarma for age Karma is to take food, etc. necessary for keeping the body alive; for body-making Karma, the bodies themselves; for family-determining Karma, birth in a high or low constitution ; and for the obstructive Karma it is like a store-keeper who prevents from enjoying freely the enjoyable things or from making charity,
पडविसयपहुदि दव्वं मदिसुदवाघादकरणसंजुत्तं । मदिसुदबोहाणं पुण णोकम्मं दवियकम्मं तु ॥ ७॥ पटविषयप्रभृति द्रव्यं मतिश्रुतव्याघातकरणसंयुक्तम् । मतिश्रुतबोधयोः पुनः नोकर्म द्रव्यकर्म तु ॥ ७० ॥
70. A curtain, and sense-enjoyments, etc., material substances capable of preventing sensitive or scriptural (knowledge, are respectively), the quasi-Karmic matter for the objective Karma, (obscuring) sensitive and scriptural knowledge.
Commentary. A curtains prevents the view of an object beyond it. It is thus a cause for the operation of sensitive-knowledge-obscuring-Karma, and is its no-Karma. Indulgence in sense-pleasures prevents application of mind for the attainment of scriptural knowledge. It acts as a stimulating cause for the operation of scriptural-knowledgeobscuring Karma, and is its no-Karma. This is by way of illustra

tion. There would be numerous auxiliary causes for the operation of Karmas, and all such would be the no-Karmas for those Karmas,
भोहिमणपज्जवाणं पडिघादणिमित्तसंकिलेसयरं । जं वज्झटं तं खलु णोकम्मं केवले णस्थि ॥ ७१॥ अवधिमनःपर्यययोः प्रतिघातनिमित्तसंक्लेशकरः । यः बाह्यार्थः स खलु नोकर्म केवले नास्ति ॥ ७१ ॥
71. The external object which causes distraction (Sanklesha), (is) a subsidiary cause, of preventing visual and mental (knowledge, and is) certainly the quasi-Karmic matter (for the visual and mental knowledge-obscuringobjective-Karma). (There) is no (quasi-Karma) for perfect knowledge. पंचएहं णिदाणं माहिसदहिपहुदि होदि णोकम्मं । वाघादकरपडादी चक्खुपचक्खूण णोकम्मं ॥७२॥ पश्चानां निद्राणां माहिषदधिप्रभृति भवति नोकर्म । व्याघातकरपटादि चक्षुरचक्षुषोः नोकर्म ॥ ७२ ।।
72. The quasi-Karmic matter for 5 kinds of sleep (sub-classes of conation-obscuring Karma) is buffalo. miik-curd, etc.; curtain, etc., which prevent ocular and non-ocular (conation, are) the quasi-Karmic matter (for ocular and non-ocular-conation-obscuring Karma).
प्रोहीकेवलदंसणणोकम्मं ताण णाणभंगो व । सादेदरणोकम्मं इटाणिहएणपाणादी ॥७३॥ अवधिकेवलदर्शननोकर्म तयोः ज्ञानभङ्गो वा । सातेतरनोकर्म इष्टानिष्टान्नपानादि ॥ ७३ ॥
73. The quasi. Karma for visual and perfect conation (obscuring Karma) is like that for the corresponding knowledge-(obscuring Karma i.e., distraction for visual conation and none for perfect-conation-obscuring Karma). And the quasi-Karma for the pleasure and the other (i e., pain-feeling Karma is respectively) pleasant or un-pleasant food, drink, etc.

74. The quasi-Karma for clouded-right-belief (Samyaktya-prakriti) is association with (Ayatana, Arhats, their images, scriptures, preceptors, etc.); (and that) for wrong belief (Mithyátva Karma is) association with misleading (Anayatana, gods, images, scriptures, and teachers, etc). (And association with) both is necessarily the quasi-Karma for mixed-right-and-wrong-belief (Samyaktva-mithyátva Karma).

75. The quasi-Karma for error-(feeding passions) is the association, etc., as for wrong belief, And for the other (12 passions it) is necessarily books and society (of persons.) etc., which are capable of (exciting) those (passions).

78. The quasi-Karmas for the objective Karma (of quasi-passion, the three sexes is) the body of woman, man and hermaphrodite. And the buffoon and a filial son (are) the quasi-Karma (respectively) for laughter (Hásya), and indulgence (Rati),

(The quasi-Karma) for hellish age is unpleasant food (mud); for the others (i. e., sub-human, human and celestial ages it is)agreeable food etc., and the quasi-Karma for the objective condition of existence is the place of the four kinds of existence. णिरयादीण गदीणं णिरयादी खेत्तयं हवे णियमा। जाईए णोकम्मं दबिंदियपोग्गलं होदि ॥ ७९ ॥ निरयादीनां गतीनां निरयादि क्षेत्रकं भवेत् नियमात् । जातेः नोकर्म द्रव्येन्द्रियपुद्गलो भवति ॥ ७६ ॥

81. The quasi-Karmas of physical, fluid, assimilative and electric body-(sub-classes of body-making) Karma are (the molecules of) the four bodies drawn in by their operation. For Karmic (body-Karma, the quasi - Karma is ) neces - sarily the group of attendant atoms (Visrasopachaya). बंधरणपहुदिसमरिणय से साणं देहमेव गोकम्मं ।

82. Of (all the body-maturing divisions) from bondage (Bandhana up to the end with the rest of the soulmaturing sub-classes of the body-making-Karma), the quasi Karma is the body itself. But note the distinction that (the quasi-Karma of the 4) migratory forms (Ánupūrvi is) the space of the corresponding (Migration).

84. The quasi-Karma for high-family-determining Karma (is) a body (born in a) high (family); for low, in a low (family); (the quasi-Karma) for the 4 (obstructive Karmas) charity and others (i. e., gain, enjoyment and reenjoyment), mountain, men etc., preventive (of charity etc.)
Commentary. There are some distant countries rich and fertile but a person cannot go there owing to the impossibility of crossing a mountain or sea. These hindrances will be quasi-Karma for gain obstructive-Karma. Similarly if any person prevents one from enjoying any objects he is a quasi-Karma for enjoyment obstructive Karma. And so on. विरियस्स य णोकम्मं रुक्खाहारादि बलहरं दव्वं । इदि उत्तरपयडीणं णोकम्मं दव्वकम्मं तु ॥८५॥ वीर्यस्य च नोकर्म रूक्षाहारादि बलहरं द्रव्यम् । इति उत्तरप्रकृतीनां नोकर्म द्रव्यकर्म तु ॥८५॥

89.

Commentary. Mundane souls have ever been binding all the 8 kinds of Karmas. There is thus no beginning of bondage ; and bondage from this point of view is called unbegun (Anádi). At each moment of our lives we are binding fresh Karmas of one kind or the other, i.e., we bind thos Karmas again which ceased to bind once; such bondage is with beginning, and is called begun (Sádi). (See also gatha 123). All Karmas will remain bound for ever to souls incapable of liberation ; this bondage is called lasting (Dhruva). Bondage which lasts for some time only, viz. which occurs after intervals is transient (Adhruva). ठिदिमणुभागपदेसा गुणपडिवरणेसु जेसिमुक्कस्सा। तेसिमणुकस्सो चउव्विहोऽजहएणेवि एमेव ॥११॥

स्थित्यनुभाग प्रदेशा गुणप्रतिपन्नेषु येषामुत्कृष्टाः । तेषामनुत्कृष्टः चतुर्विध जघन्येपि एवमेव ॥ ६१ ॥
91. In (souls) advancing in (spiritual) stages, there is (in one and the same stage), non-maximum (bondage) of those Karmas of which there is the maximum (bondage), as regards duration (Sthiti), fruition-intensity (Anubhága) and molecular-density (Pradesha), (and appertaining to any of) the 4 kinds (begun, etc). Similarly (there is) non-minimum (where there is minimum).
Commentary.
As an example, take the case of a soul on the subsidential ladder. When he reaches the 10th stage of slightest-passion, he binds the maximum fruition-intensity of the high-family Karma and then proceeds on to the 11th, the subsided-passion stage. There he stays a very short time, and must fall back to the 10th stage. There he binds the non-maximum fruition-intensity of high-family Karma. This non-maximum bondage is of the "begun" (Sádi) kind, because it has a beginning. Again; take the case of a hellish being in the 7th hell about to acquire right-belief. He will bind the minimum fruitionintensity of low-family determining Karma, in the last instant of wrong-belief stage. The same soul falling from right-belief into the wrong-belief stage binds non-minimum-fruition intensity of lowfamily-determining Karma. This is also the "begun" (Sádi) kind.
The fruition-intensity bondage of the family-determining Karma has always been in this soul, and is of the "unbegun" (Anádi) kind.
In a soul incapable of liberation, the Karmas remain bound forever, such bondage is called lasting (Dhruva). The maximum fruition-intensity bondage of high-family-determining Karma which precedes the non-maximum bondage as given above is an example of transient (Adhruva) bondage.

(The bondage) of age (Ayu Karma occurs)in the wrong belief, etc., (up to the 7th stage of perfect vow), except (the 3rd or) mixed (stage and except in the potentially developables, or niryritti aparyápta, conditions in which there is mixed vibration of the 3 kinds of mixed bodies). And the bondage of the other (divisions of Karma takes place in stages up to the bondage-cessation--Bandha Vyuchchhitti, (i.e., up to the point where although, such Karmas remain in existence and bound, up, yet they do not attract other corresponding Karmic matter for further bondage of the soul).

93. Men, possessing the first-subsidential, and the other three (kinds of) right-belief, (i.e., second-subsidential, destructive-subsidential and destructive)in the four, vowless, and other (i. e., partial, imperfect, and perfect vow stages), initiate the bondage of Tirthakara (sub-class of body-makking Karma)near the two, omniscient(Kevali, and all-scripture-knowing saint, shruta Kevali).
Commentary. First subsidential belief lasts only for one Antar-muhúrta, which according to some saints is too short to carry out the 16 meditations (Shodasa Kárana Bhávaná) which are necessary for the initiatory bondage of Tirthakara Karma. The beginning of the bondage of this supreme Karma can be made only by a man, and that also near an omniscient or an all-scripture knowing saint, because in no other surroundings can the necessary purity of thought-activity be attained. But although thus begun in the human condition, the bondage of Tirthakara Karma can continue in all the conditions

106. In Gharmá, (the first hell, in developable and undevelopable conditions), the Tirthankara Karma continues to be bound, (but it never begins, to be bound there); but in Vansha and Meghá, (the 2nd and 3rd hells, it is bound) in developables only (as there is a break in its continuity in non-developable condition). Human age (Karma is bound) till the 6th (hell). And in the last (hell) in the wrong (belief stage) only, sub-human age (Karma is bound). मिस्साविरदे उच्चं मणुवदुगं सत्तमे हवे बंधो। मिच्छा सासणसम्मा मणुवदुगुच्चं ण बंधति ॥ १०७॥ मिश्राविरते उच्चं मनुष्यद्वयं सप्तमे भवेद् बन्धः । मिथ्यास्विनःसासादनसम्यक्त्वा मनुष्यद्विकोचमबध्नन्ति॥१०७॥

Out of (these) remaining (73) Tirthankara, assimilative (body and limbs) the four, other destructive (Paragháta, radiance, Átápa, phosphoresence, udyota, and respiration, and) all (the 4) ages-(these 11 are) without opposite (apratipaksha). The remaining 62 certainly (are) with opposite (Sapratipaksha).
Commentary. With-opposite sub-classes are so called because they are in sets mutually repugnant; the bondage of one excludes the bondage of the other. For example, when there is bondage of pleasure-feeling, there cannot be a bondage of pain-feeling. Sometimes ane may seem to feel both pleasure and pain, but this feeling is merely the operation and not bondage of the pleasure and pain-feeling Karmas; and even then the mixed feeling is only apparent, and not real ; because attention changes from pleasure to pain so instantaneously, that although the feelings are really successive, they seem to be simultaneous. The operation also of pleasure and pain-feeling Karmas is successive and not simultaneous.

126, The (process of) minimum (bondage) of Tírthankara, of assimilative (body and limbs), and of all (the four) age (Karmas, continues) for an Antar-muhúrta.. (The process of minimum bondage) of the (remaining) sixty-six (takes only) one instant. Thus the remaining (73 non-lasting Karmas are said to have a bondage of) two kinds (begun and non-lasting).

Commentary. The number of degrees of passions in the maximum-thoughtactivity is innumerable into innumerable spatial units of the universe. Divide this into parts; the number which is innumerable part of a Palya. The passion-thought-activity in the last part is maximum, in the first part minimum, and in the intervening parts, the medium.

Commentary. Abadhá or quiescence means the period during which a Karma ter its bondage remains immature and does not rise for operation. On the expiry of this time, the Karmic molecules begin to operate, and they gradually shed off, until the full duration of the Karma is completed. The Abádhá period will be included in the durationbondage. जेहाबाहोवट्टियजेटं आबाहकंडयं तेण । आबाहवियप्पहदेणेगणेणणजेहमवरठिदी ॥ १४७॥

ज्येष्ठाबाधोद्वर्तितज्येष्ठमाबाधाकाण्डकं तेन । आवाधाविकल्पहतेन एकोनेन ऊनजेष्ठमवरस्थितिः ॥ १४७ ॥
147. The maximum (duration of a Karma) divided by its maximum quiscence, is its quiescence-section (AbádháKándaka, showing the number of the variety of durations with equal quiescence).
After multiplying this by the number of divisions of quiescence, and deducting (the product) less one, from the maximum duration, (we obtain) the minimum (duration).
Commentary, To illustrate. Let the maximum duration of a Karma be 64, and the minimum duration 45 instants. The intermediate durations would be of 63 to 46 instants. Let 16 be the maximum period of . quiescence. Abádhá Kándaka, 'or quiescence-section is a group of durations, each of which is possessed of equal quiescence. In each group the quiescence will be gradually decreased by a common difference. In order to find out the Abádhá Kándaka in a duration of 64 instants we should divide these instants by 16, the maximum quiescence. The quotient 4 would be the number of periods, each of equal quiescence. This group will include Karmas of duration varying from 64 to 61 instants each one of quiescence of 16 instants, For those with durations varying from 60 to 57, the quiescence would be of 15 instants, taking one, as common difference. For those from 56 to 53, the quiescence will be of 14 instants; for those from 52 to 49, it will be of 13 instants ; and for those from 48 to 45, it will be of 12 instants.
Here the numbers of divisions of quiescence are five, (i, e., of 16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 instants). The minimum quiescence here is of 12 instants. The namber of divisions is obtained by applying the following rule :maximum quiescence - minimum quiescence 16-12 Common difference,
+1= 1 +1-5. According to the Gatha, the minimum duration is 64-(4x5 - 1) 64-19-45. We can also find out the minimum quiescence for the minimum duration. Minimum quiescence section begins from 48 to 45 instants. If 16 is ábádhá for a Karma with duration of 64 instants, what will be the Abádhá for one with 48 instants. By application
16 X 48 of Rule of Three, we get to. 12 instants. These 12 instants

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
In one-sensed beings, the maximum duration of wrong-belief is one Ságara, and the minimum is one Ságara minus (innumerable part of a Palya minus one instant). The divisions of duration from maximum to minimum having a common difference of one instant (Samaya) are equal to innumerable part of a Palya.
Now by rule of three, if innumerable parts of a Palya are divisions of duration in bondage of wrong-belief for 343 parts, the number of divisions for 196 parts will be 19 assuming the innumerable part of a Palya-x.
This is the number of divisions of duration from the maximum of gross developable to the maximum of fine developables. Then the maximum duration of fine developables will be:--
1 Sagar- (1965-1. }
343
28x
In the same way, we will be the number of divisions of duration from one instant less than the maximum of fine developable to the maximum of gross undevelopables. Therefore the maximum
196x duration of gross undevelopable would be 1 Ságara-1 -1 -10
343
343 Thus we should get the durations of each of 8 divisions for onesensed beings. Also the quiescience (Abádhá) should be found in the same way.
In the same way for durations of 4 kinds of 2-sensed, as below:
The middle is from maximum of undevelopable to minimum of undevelopable ...
1 Shaláká. Then below, from minimum of undevelopable to minimum of developable-1x2–...
... 2 Shalákás. Then above from maximum of undevelopable to maximum of developable-22
... 4 Shalákás.
Total- ... 7 Shalákás. ... The maximum duration of wrong-belief is 25 Ságaras and the minimum is (Palya-1) + 4 times numerable.
In the same manner the divisions for 3, 4, and 5-sensed irrationals should be found.

154. And leaving aside the human, sub-human and celestial ages, (all kinds of) duration (bondage) of the remaining good and bad (Karmas) are bad.
Commentary. Duration of bondage is determined by intensity of passions. Passions prevent liberation ; therefore all duration bondage is bad. Celestial, human and sub-human ages are not bad, because they afford an opportunity of subduing and destroying passions. Subhuman beings can reach up to the 5th stage of partial vow. Hellish beings can attain at the most to the 4th stage of vowless rightbelief, but they cannot go out of hell to any place where piety can be practised. In this respect, they differ from celestial beings who are also in the 4th stage, but can move about and perform acts of piety such as worshipping Arhats, attending upon saints, and visit. ing Jain temples. Beings in hell always desire to get rid of their bodies, while those in other conditions of existence are more or less

Commentary. Karmic matter flows into the soul on account of soul-vibrations, and by operation of Karmic body sub-class of body-making Karma ; and then binds the soul, for a definite duration varying with the intensity of passions. The period between the moment of bondage and the commencement of its operation, matured, or immatured, is called Abadha.

158. With regard to (mature) operation (Udaya) the quiescence (period) of the seven (Karmas, i.e., all except the age Karma is) 100 years when (the bondage duration is) a crore of crore Ságaras. And for the other durations, (it is) in the same proportion.
Commentary. In a year there are 360 days; in a day 30 muhúrtas, and 3773 pulse-beats in a muhúrta, which consists of 48 minutes. Thus in on hundred years there are 100 x 360x24x60x3,773:4834,07,48,40,000 pulse-beats. The quiescence for a bondage duration of one Ságara is 4,07,48,40,000-10,00,00,00,00,00,000 of one-pulse beat. Thus it is clear that Karmas whose bondage is of ordinary duration begin to operate practically at once.

. The four kinds of bondage duration are maximum, non-maximum, non-minimum and minimum. One extreme represents the maximum, and the other, the minimum. The spaces from the middle point to the maximum represents the non-maximum and to the minimum, the non-minimum. The maximum and minimum durations are extremely rare. Ordinarily the durations are of medium types of varying length. Our ordinary passions are neither extremely intense or mild. The corresponding bondage-duration is also of ordinary length. The quiescence for one Ságará years' duration is roughly 25,000th part or exactly speaking *0,00,04,07,484 of a pulse-beat. A Sagara consists of innumerable years. Thus it is evident that if a person at the moment of birth binds a Karma of 70 or 80 year's duration, it must begin to operate after one Ávalí or winki.e., practically at once. . अंतोकोडाकोडिहिदिस्स अंतोमुत्तमाबाहा ।

157. The quiescence in a (bondage) duration of oneinter-crore of crore (Ságaras is) one antar-muhúrta. And a numerable part of it (is the quiescence) of the minimum duration of all (the bondages).
पुव्वाणं कोडितिभा-गादासंखेप अद्ध वोत्ति हवे ।

158. The quiescence of the age (Karma) is from onethird of one-crore Púrva years (as maximum) to (the minimum) briefest time (Asankshepáddhá, an innumerable part of an Ávalí or wink). (But note that) in age (the quiescence is) not a proportionate part of the duration, as in other Karmas).
Commentary. : The age Karma is bound at one of the eight declining-times (Apakarshana Kala), see Gatha 517 (Jiva-Kanda). The maximum age is one crore Púrva years in the case of humans in work-region

(Karma-bhúmi). So the longest quiescence possible cannot be more than one-third of one crore of Purva years. The maximum celestial . and hellish ages are 33 Ságaras and of humans and sub-humans of the enjoyment regions, 3 Palyas. But the celestial and hellish brings bind their next age-Karma 6 months, and the enjoyment region humans and sub-humans 9 months, before death. Therefore their quiescence cannot be more than one-third of this time.

159 As to premature operation (Udirna) of the seven Karmas (i. e., all except age) the quiescence (is) one Ávalí, and necessarily (there) is no premature operation of the age (Karma) for the next incarnation (in the present incarnation).
Commentary. The Ávali in the Gatha is called Achalávali or fixed wink, i.e. the minimum period of quiescence. Some matter out of the mole. cules having long duration can be brought to operation prematurely by diminishing their duration. Such Karmas must have a minimum quiescence of one ávalí before premature operation, Udírná.

160. (The number of) drippings (Nisheka) of the seven Karmas (is the number of instants in) the duration of the Karma minus its quiescence. And necessarily the .drippings (Nisheka) of the age-Karma is (the number of instants in) its duration.

Commentary. Dripping is the number of molecules of particular Karma which are shed is one instant. It should be known that Karmic molecules bound at a particular instant begin to operate after passing the quiescence. Then those molecules are distributed over all the ins - tants of the duration minus ábádhá. In each instant thereafter there is a shedding of a lesser number of molecules than in the former, by a common difference (Chaya). Their proportion and distribution has been illustrated in Gatha No. 5.
आबाहं बोलाविय पढमणिसेगम्मि देय बहुगं तु। तत्तो विसेसहीणं बिदियस्सादिमणिसेओत्ति ॥ १६१ ॥ श्राबाधां वा अपलाप्य प्रथमनिषेके देयं बहुकं तु । ततो विशेषहीनं द्वितीयस्यादिमनिषेक इति ॥ १६१ ॥
181. After passing the quiescence, the greatest (num. ber of molecules) should be assigned to the first dripping (of the first Gunahání), (i.e., the greatest number of molecules will be shed in the first instant of any dripping). Then reduce (at each instant) by the common difference (Chaya) or(Nishekha) up to the first dripping of the next Gunahání). (See note to Gatha 5).
बिदिये बिदियणिसेगे हाणी पुब्विल्लहाणिअद्धं तु । एवं गुणहाणिं पडि हाणी अद्धद्धयं होदि ॥ १६२॥ द्वितीये द्वितीयनिषेके हानिः पूर्वहान्य तु । एवं गुणहानि प्रति हानिः अर्धाधं भवति ॥ १६२ ॥
162. In the second (and other) drippings of the second (Gunaháni), the common difference (is) half of the common diffierence of the first (Gunáhani) and similarly in each Gunaháni the common difference (Chaya) is half of that in (the preceding one).
Commentary. If the unit of bondage be assumed as 6300 molecules, as in note to Gatha 5, and the period of their shedding, after deducting Ábádhá be 48 instants, the number of molecules in the first dripping

Commentary.
The thought-activity which goes on continuously increasing or decreasing without retracing its increase or decrease is called unreturnable Aparivartamána. Its stages between its two ends are its medium. And the returnable (Parivartamána) is where the increase or decrease is not continuous, but after increase or decrease for some time there is a change and a return backwards to the thought-activity with which the start was made.

180. The power (of fruition) of the (4) destructive (Karmas, i.e., knowledge-and conation-obscuring, deluding and obstructive Karmas) is said to be like the creepers (Latá), wood (Dáru), bone (Asthi), and stone (Páshána), (where the hardness increases at every step). And (from the creeper degree) up to an infinite part of the wood (degree) the degrees are partially-destructive (Desha Gháti), and all (the degrees) beyond that, (aer all-destructive Sarvagháti),
Commentary.
Partially-destructive Karmas are those which do not wholly destroy the qualities of the soul. Except the deluding Karmas, their destructive-subsidence always exists in a greater or less degree, resulting in some quality of the soul being unobscured, while alldestructive Karmas are those which totally obscure the quality of a soul, which can only be exposed by their full destruction. For example, perfect knowledge-obscuring Karma is all-destructive. Until it is destroyed, not a bit of perfect knowledge is possible. Sensitive and scriptural knowledge-obscuring Karmas are partiallydestructive. Their destructive-subsidence always exists in every mundane soul; therefore each soul from one-sensed to five sensed has got some sensitive and letterless scriptural knowledge.

Karmas is concerned, clouds the right-belief and) forms the Samyaktva (Prakriti or right-belief-slightly-clouded by wrong-belief, sub-class of right-belief đeluding Karma).
An infinite part of that(which is left of the) wood(class), (forms) the mixed (right-and-wrong-belief, Samyaktva. mithyátva sub-class of the right-belief-deluding Karma). The remaining infinite parts (of wood class and the whole of) the bone (and) the stone (classes of) powers of fruition (form) the wrong-belief (Mithyátva sub-class of the rightbelief-deluding Karma).
Commentary, The wholly destructive power of fruition is separate for the mixed-right-and-wrong-belief sub-class of the right-belief deluding Karma. The following chart shows the distribution of the four classes of the power of fruition over the 3 sub-classes of the rightbelief-deluding-Karma.

w-

W
The following chart shows that the harder or intenser kind of fruition always includes the softer or milder kind; but not vice versa. For example wrong-belief may be of 3 degrees of fruition:
(1) Of the utmost intensity represented by the hardness of stone. This includes the hardness of bone and the maximum hardness of wood.
(2) Of the intensity represented by the hardness of bone. It includes the maximum hardness of wood.
(3) Of the intensity represented by the maximum hardness of wood.
Similarly right-belief-clouded by wrong-belief is of 2 kinds:

It would be seen that the intensity of mixed-right-and-wrongbelief is represented only by the medium hardness of wood. It will have infinite degrees of hardness, but its hardness as a class remains milder than the hardness of a bone and intenser than the hardness or softness of a creeper. See chart below :

Commentary,
The destructive sub-classes of Karmas are 47, 5 knowledge obscuring, 9 conation-obscuring, 28 deluding and 5 obstructive. Of these 17 partially-destructive are dealt with above. They have all the four degrees of intensity. Two, namely the right-wrongbelief, and clouded right-belief are not bound at all. They merely appear in the bondage of wrong belief, and emerge as distinct subclasses in the operation of the wrong-belief sub-class; i. e., the bondage is only of wrong-belief; but its operation is in the form of all these 3 sub-classes, if the wrong-believer from the 1st stage of

wrong-belief by the subsidence of Karmas, attains right-belief and
passes on to the 4th stage. This subsidence lasts for one Antar· muhúrta and in this interval the matter of the wrong-belief-Karma splits up into the 3 kinds of, wrong-belief, right-wrong-belief, and clouded-right-belief. After the antar-muhurta of subsidence, the soul passes into the stage corresponding to any of these three, which-ever may come into operation. It is thus that although the bondage is of wrong-belief only, the operation is of the three-subclasses.
The four kinds of intensity as they are distributed in the above 3 sub-classes have been dealt with in Gatha 181.
Thus leaving these 20 aside, we are left with 27. These may be considered in two groups, 19 of wholly destructive and 8 of partially destructive. In the 19 wholly destructive, i.e., in perfect knowledgeobscuring, perfect-conation-obscuring, somnambulism, deep sleep, heavy drowsiness, sleep and drowsiness, and in the 12, i. e., error-feeding, partial and total vow-preventing classes of the 4 passions anger, pride, deceit and greed, there are only 3 degrees of fruition in intensity corresponding to the hardness of stone, bone, and wood as given in the chart below:--
And in the 8 partially destructive minor passions, i, e., all the nine except male inclination, there are only 3 degrees of intensity of fruition corresponding to stone, bone and wood as given below:
Notice that in the 3 degrees of the 19, creeper is omitted ; but it is included in the 3 degrees of the eight.
A partially destructive sub-class at its lowest may have a very very mild intensity like the softness of the creeper. But even the lowest kind of a wholly destructive Karma in intensity is like the medium hardness of wood.

183. The remaining non-destructive classes (are) with (3) divisions like the destructive (Karmas). (And) these alone (are classified (into) merit (and) demerit. The others, i. e, destructive) should be known (to be only) demerit.

184. The merit (sub-classes of the) non-destructive (Karmas have their) divisions (of fruition) like molasses, candy, sugar, and nectar. The demerit (sub-classes have) like Neem, Kánjira, poison (Visha) deadly poison (Háláhala).
Commentary.
Of the total 148 sub-classes, only 120 are bound, i.e., all except the right-wrong-belief, and clouded-right-belief, sub-classes of the right-belief deluding Karma ; 5 molecular bondages, 5 interfusions, and 16 out of 20 sub-classes of touch, taste, smell and colour.
All the 120 operate, but in its operation the wrong-belief sub-class of right-belief-deluding Karma is spilt in three parts; therefore the bondage is of 120, but the operation is of 122. Of these 122, 47 are destructive. They are 5 knowledge-obscuring, 9 conation-obscuring, 28 deluding and 5 obstructive. The rest i.e., 75 are non-destructive. Of these 75, 42 involve merit and 33 demerit. But as all Karmas are material and matter has always some kind of touch. taste, smell and colour, these four must be added to these 33, thus making the demerit sub-classes 37.
The degrees of fruition of the 42 merit and 37 demerit subclasses are of 3 kinds. The lowest degree of merit or of demerit

185. (The soul) binds by causes brought about by itself to all its units (Pradeshas) (the Karmic molecules) fit to become Karmas which occupy one-body-extent (Eka Kshetra). (These molecules are) unbegun (Anádi), begun (Sádi), or both (ubhaya).
Commentary. In the above definition of molecule Eka Kshetra, one-body-extent is the space occupied by the lowest possible body of a fine undevelopable common soul; see No. 1 in the table under Gatha 101 of Jiva Kanda page 76). This is in contra-distinction to Aneka-kshetra or not-one-body-extent which is all the space except the one-bodyextent.
Yogyam - fit to become Karma Karmic molecules (Karma Varganá) are dead matter. They never become living. But they can be united by the living soul with itself; and then they are called Karmas.
Svaka-hetubhih- The soul is alone responsible for all its activity which is the real cause of the bondage of Karmic matter. Five such

causes are given in Jain Siddhanta, Wrong-belief, Mithyátva; Vowlessness, Avirata; Carelessness, Pramáda; Passions, Kasháya; and Virbration, Yoga.
Anadi or " Unbegun" molecules are those which never have been bound to any soul. This can be easily understood, when we remember that molecules of other kinds of matter are constantly being transformed into Karmic molecules, which are obviously virgin of all bondage.
Sádi or“ begun” are those molecules whose bondage has already begun, i.e., which have been bound already to some soul or other and having been shed by that are bound again. Roughly the anonlogy is the same as that of new and second hand clothes.

186. The space occupied by one body (i. e., the body of a fine completely undevelopable common vegetable, Súkshama, Labdhyaparyáptaka Nigoda), (is) one-body. extent (Eka-Kshetra). The rest of the universal space (is) not one-body-extent (Aneka-Kshetra), (and) the material (Rúpi) Karma is located according to (these two) extents.

187. An infinite part of the matter which is located in one-body and not-one-body-extent is fit (for becoming Karma). The rest is unfit. Each (is) begun (Sádi) and unbegun (Anádi).
Commentary. Thus there are 3 pairs of distinctions:-- One-body and not-onebody-extent; fit and unfit to become Karma; and begun and un-begun; and there are8divisions (2x2x2):

188. The maximum unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha) multiplied by (the instants of) past time, (the product ) being multiplied by the total (number of) souls is the begun (Sádi or second-hand Karmic matter). So it is has been said.
Commentary.
Jyestha-The maximum unit of bondage is that which is produced by the maximum vibratory activity of the soul. All begun or second-hand Karmic matter is that which has been bound to any soul at least once. Therefore the whole of it must be included in the total matter which has been bound to all the souls. If we suppose every instant of their existence to have been one of activity corresponding to maximum bondage, its maximum bondage is possible, but it is not actually maximum bondage. This is so because every soul in every instant of its existence is not necessarily with the maximum vibratory thought-activity. Therefore the begun or second-hand Karmic matter must be less than the above product.

189. The fit end begun matter is an infinite part of the (whole begun) matter which exists in the extent of each (whether it be one-body or not-one-body extent, Eka, or Aneka Kshetra). The rest is unfit and begun matter. So it has been said.

190. The quantity of unbegun, fit, and unfit matter, (respectively) is necessarily the (total) fit and unfit matter, minus it own respective begun (matter).
Commentary. Matter is of two kinds, fit for Karmic bondage or unfit for Karmic bondage. Each is of two kinds (1) begun or Sadi which was bound and then shed off and (2) unbegun or Anádi, which has not yet been bound. This mundane soul at every instant absorbs fit matter sometimes begun, sometimes unbegun, sometimes mixed.

Commentary. One unit of bondage consists of molecules so-fine that it is not possible to appertain to it the four conditions of touch, i. e., heavy and light, hard and soft. It is modified into other conditions of touch, all kinds of taste, colour and smell.

आयुष्कभागः स्तोकः नामगोत्रे समः ततः अधिकः। घातित्रयेपि च ततः मोहे ततः ततः तृतीये ॥ १६२॥
192. (The above unit of bondage is transformed into the 8 classes of Karmas as follows):
The age part (is) the least. The body and family (Karmas are) equal, (but) more than that (i. e., the age Karma). And the three destructive (obstructive, conation and knowledge obscuring are) also (equal), (but more) than that (i. e., the body or family Karma). The deluding Karma (is more) than that (i. e., any of these three destructive Karmas). (And) the third (i, e., the feeling Karma is more) than that (i. e., the deluding Karma).
Commentary. Note that the transformation into the age Karma is possible only in the 8 "declining-times" Apakarsha-Kála (see Jíva Kánda Gatha 518 page 258). Otherwise the unit of bondage is transformed into the remaining 7 Karmas up to 9th stage. In the 10th there is no transformation into the Deluding Karma. In the 11th, 12th and 13th stages the transformation is only into the pleasure (Sátá) Feeling (Vedaniya) Karma.

193. Owing to continuous) causes for pleasure and pain, (there is) much shedding of (feeling-Karma), therefore the largest (part of Karmic) matter is appropriated by feeling-Karma. So it has been said.
Commentary. In every instant of our life there is a feeling of pleasure or pain. These two feelings predominate all other sensations. The operation and fruition of every Karma implies shedding of its Karmic matter. There is thus a continuous and considerable shedding of the feeling Karmas,

198. (As to matter) of the sub-classes; (that of each sub-class) of (each of) the deluding, (and knowledge and conation) obscuring Karma is (gradually) decreasing in due order.

(Among sub-classes) of the remaining (i. e., feeling, family and age-Karmas there is) no distribution (of matter). Commentary.
. In one instant there is bondage of either pleasure or painfeeling; of high or low family and of one of the 4 kinds of age-Karma. Therefore there is no distribution in sub-classes of feeling, family and age-Karma. Let us take an example of decreasing matter. The matter of scriptural knowledge-obscuring Karma is less than that of the sensitive knowledge obscuring Karma and the matter of visual knowledge-obscuring Karma is less than that of the scripturat knowledge-obscuring Karma.

As example of increasing matter, the matter of gain-obstructive Karma is more than that of charity-obstructive Karma; and that of enjoyment-obstructive Karma is more than that of the gainobstructive Karma; and so on.

197. The matter of the total obscuring (or whollydestructive Sarva-Gháti sub-classes) of the root-classes (i.e., of knowledge and conation obscuring and deluding classes is) an infinite part (of the total of its class). The remain ing infinite parts are the matter of the partially-obscuring (or destructive Desha-Gháti sub-classes).
Commentary. Although sensitive, scriptural, visual, and mental knowledgeobscuring and ocular, non-ocular and visual conation-obscuring; and perfect conduct-preventing 4 passions, and 8 quasi passions, subclasses are partially-destructive, yet each of them contains some matter which fully obscures the nature of all. Where Sarva-Gháti is operative also, one cannot have a bit of its opposite nature, for example one-sensed beings have not got ocular conation, because there is operation of matter of all-ocular-conation-obscuring Karmas.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary.
Obviously the distinction of partially-destructive, Desha-Gháti and wholly-destructive Sarva-Gháti applies only to the sub-classes of 4 destructive Karmas. So does also the distinction as to the 4 degrees of intensity of fruition, as examplified by the degrees of hardness of stone, bone, wood and creeper. The hardness of a creeper and an infinite part of wood is confined to the partially destructive Karmas. Beyond that there are the wholly destructive, see Gatha 180.
Let 3100 be the whole matter bound in one instant, 40 instants be the duration, Nana Gunaháni -5, Gunaháni-8, than 2 Gunaháni 16 and Anyonyá bhastaráshi - 32.
Then 3100 (32-1)-100-the number of molecules in last Gunaháni of stone kind of matter.
Then five Gunáhánis will be 100+ 200+400+800+ 1,600. Total 3,100.
Here 1,600 molecules is the number of creeper kind of partially destructive Karmas. A little more than this 1,600, i.e., 1,600 adding something equal to infinite part of wood kind is the total number of molecules of partially destructive Karmas. The remaining is the number of molecules of wholly destructive Karmas.
सव्वावरणं दव्वं विभंजणिज्जं तु उभयपयडीसु । देसावरणं दव्वं देसावरणेसु विदरे ॥ १६६ ॥ सर्वावरणं द्रव्यं विभञ्जनीयं तु उभयप्रकृतिषु । देशावरणं द्रव्यं देशावरणेषु नैवेतरस्मिन् ॥ १६६ ॥
199. The wholly-destructive matter should be distributed among both the sub-classes (i. e., wholly and partially destructive sub-classes). The partially-destructive matter (should be distributed) among the partially-destructive sub-classes, but never in the other (i. e., wholly-destructive sub-classes).
Commentary.
Infinite part of the molecules of any destructive Karma is the number of wholly-destructive-matter and the remaining many parts is that of partially-destructive matter. The molecules of whollydestructive, are to be distributed to both sub-classes of wholly and partially-destructive, but the partially-destructive matter should only be given to themselves.

Commentary.
Five minor passions are mentioned, because only 5 out of 9 are bound in one instant as below:

Lastly the balance should be given to (5) disgust which will have least matter.
Such distribution is done up to the 8th stage of new-thoughtactivity. In the 9th stage of advanced-thought-activity the whole matter should be given to male inclination, as only this out of 5 is bound there,
The matter of perfect-right.conduct-preventing Karma should be distributed among four up to the part of the 9th stage up to which anger is bound; after that in three in the part of the 9th where up to which pride is bound; then in two up to which deceit is bound, then only to greed.

205. The bondage of male (inclination can be continuous) for a period of one Antar-muhúrta. (The period) for female inclination, the pair laughter (and indulgence), and the two ennui (and sorrow is) numerable times (of the immediately preceding one).

Commentary. For the places (sthána) of the body-making Karma see Gatha 521.
There are 6 places in which 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 1 subclasses of body-making Karma are bound simultaneously. The 23 which simultaneously bound by a wrong-believer, human and subhuman soul, are the following:

Beginning of vibratory divisions (Yoga Sthána) which are the causes of bondage according to nature and molecules of Karmic matter.

Vibratory divisions (Yoga Sthána are) of three kinds, birth-(vibratory division), Upapáda Yoga (Sthána), increasing (vibratory division), Ekánta-Vriddhi (Sthana) changing-(vibratory division, Parináma Yoga Sthána). As to divisions, each (division has) 14 kinds (according to the 14 soul-classes.) (Each one) again (is) of 3 kinds.

Commentary These last 3 kinds are-Common (Sámánya), minimum and maximum. There are 14 common, 28 common and minimum and 42 common, minimum and maximum divisions of each of three vibratory divisions.
उववादजोगठाणा भवादिसमयट्टियस्स अवरवरा । विग्गहइजुगइगमणे जीवसमासे मुणेयव्वा ॥ २१६॥ उपपादयोगस्थानानि भवादिसमयस्थितस्यावरवराणि । विग्रहर्जुगतिगमने जीवसमासे मन्तव्यानि ॥ २१६ ॥
219. The birth vibratory divisions (Upapáda Yoga Sthána in soul-classes) should be known to be minimum and maximum in the first instant of the birth of a soul after transmigration with turnings or in straight line (respectively).
Commentary. The birth-vibratory division has a duration of only one instant namely the instant of birth which immediately follows the last instant of transmigration. It is also the first instant of the undevelopable condition of the soul. The vibratory activity is minimum, if the birth takes place after three turnings in transmigration. It is maximum if the birth follows a straight transmigration without any turning whatsoever. It should be noted that this birth-vibratory division is with reference to the developables also, because although they are partially developable, i. e., undevelopable in the first instant of their birth, yet they are under operation of develop
e body-making Karma. They must become developable after an Antar-muhúrta.

220, Changing-vibratory divisions (Parináma YogaSthana), are from (the last instant of the) completion of the capacity to develope the body (Sharíra Paryapti) up to the last instant (of the age Karma). (And) for the

completely undevelopable souls, (changing vibration divi. sions) should be known to be in the last one-third (period of their age-Karma).
Commentary. Last one-third.-The age of a completely undevelopable soul is one-eighteenth part of a pulse-beat. If it were 81 years, then its first one-third part would be 27, its second one third, 9; its third, 3; its fourth, 1; its fifth, } ; its sixth ); its seventh, a'r; and its eight, si years, which is as of the original age. Therefore the last one-third of the age of a completely undevelopable soul is equal tongxsapulsebeats – 18X6561 pulse-beats - 118.09gpulse-beats. This is the total period of the changing vibratory divisions of a completely undevelop able soul. It includes the minimum and the maximum changing vibration divisions...

221. And at all instants after the completion of the capacity to develope its (body up to the end of life there can be) maximum vibration. At all instants (there) may be minimum (vibration also). In the completely undevelopable (soul) also in the period of the changing vibration there can be) maximum (and minimum vibration).

222. Only increasing vibratory divisions (Ekántánuvriddhi Yoga Sthána) occur between the two (i, e., after the birth instant and beginning of changing vibratory) divi. sions. (And the) minimum and maximum divisions (are) in the beginning and the end of its duration respectively.

Commentary. This division is called increasing because in every instant of its duration, there is an innumerable-fold increase of indivisible units of degrees of increase (Avibhága Pratichchheda). .
Its duration is from the second instant of birth up to the last but one instant of the completion of the capacity to develope the body.
अविभागपडिच्छेदो वग्गो पुण वग्गणा य फड्डयगं । गुणहाणीवि य जाणे ठाणं पडि होदि णियमेण ॥ २२३॥ अविभागप्रतिच्छेदो वर्गः पुनः वर्गणा च स्पर्धकम् । गुणहानिरपि च जानीहि स्थानं प्रति भवति नियमेन ॥२२३॥
223. Indivisible units of degree of increase (Avi. bhága Pratichchheda make a), “ Varga". (Vargas make) a "vargana". (Varganas make) a "Spardhaka." And (Spardhakas make) a “Gunaháni." Know that every vibratory division is necessarily (composed of these).
Commentary. All vibratory divisions are in number equal to an innumerable part of the basic line of the universe (Jagat Shreni).

224. In one (vibratory) division, the number of Gunahání is an innumerable part of a Palya. (They are called Náná Gunaháni.) And the Spardhakas in one Gunaháni (are) an innumerable part of (the basic) line (of the universe).

225. And the number of Varganás for each Spardhaka is the same as given (before, i. e., an innumerable part of a basic line of the universe). And in each Varganá, the Vargas are innumerable times the basic area of the universe (Jagat pratara).
एकेके पुण वग्गे असंखलोगा हवंति अविभागा। अविभागस्त पमाणं जहण्णउड्डी पदेसाणं ॥ २२६ ॥ एकैके पुनः वर्गे असंख्यलोका भवन्ति अविभागाः। अविभागस्य प्रमाणं जघन्यवृद्धिः प्रदेशानाम् ॥ २२६ ।।
226. And in each Varga, the indivisible units of degrees of increase (Avibhága Pratichchheda) are innumerable times the spatial units of universe. And the measure of indivisible (unit of degree of increase is), the minimum increase in the (capacity of the) units (Pradesha of the soul).
इगिठाणफड्याओ वग्गणसंखा पदेसगुणहाणी। सेढिअसंखेजदिमा असंखलोगा हु अविभागा ॥ २२७॥ एकस्थानस्पर्धकानि वर्गणासंख्या प्रदेशगुणहानिः । श्रेण्यसंख्यातिमा असंख्यलोका हि अविभागाः॥ २२७ ॥
227. In one vibratory division (Yega Sthana) (the number of all) the Spardhakas, Varganás, and (the period, Áyáma of) Gunahàni in the (innumerable) spatial units (of soul), (is each) an innumerable part of (the basic) line (of the universe). And the (total number of) indivisible (units of degree of increase are) the innumerable times the spatial units of universe.
Commentary. . Note that the innumerable as applied to the above different divisions is not the same. It is of many many kinds, see the 21 kinds of numbers in the appendix to Jain Gem Dictionary.

228. All (i. e., the innumerable) units of one soul divided by one and a half Gunaháni (give) the first (Var. gana of the first Spardhaka of the first Gunahání). Then the common difference being subtracted (at each step we get the succeeding Varganás). Each Gunaháni is successively half of its immediately preceding one.

229. The number of the Spardhakas (of a Gunáhání) multiplied by the minimum (Varga) is the first Vargana of that (Gunaháni).
The Vargas of the second, etc., Varganas are increased successively by one indivisible unit of a degree of increase (Avibhága Pratichchheda), (being added to the Varga immediately preceding).

The difference between the forces of a unit (Pradesha) of soul which has got minimum force and of another Pradesha which has got the least greater force than that of minimum force is called Avibhága Pratichchheda.
The minimum force in one Fradesha if measured by this Avibhága Pratichchheda will be equal to innumerable times the units of universe. This minimum force is called Varga. The collecti of such Vargas is Varganá. The soul has got Pradeshas of minimum force which amount to innumerable basic area of universe. There fore the same number of Vargas-Vargana. This is called first Varganá.
Collection of those Pradeshas of soul, each of which has got force greater by one Avibhága Pratichchheda than that of the minimum force is second Varganá; but number of Vargas will be less in this Varganá by a common difference or Chaya, which is found by dividing the 1st Varganá by 2 Gunahánis.
In this way the third, etc., Varganás will be greater in force but less in number by a common difference. In this way "innumerable part of basic area of universe" of Varganás make one first Spardhaka.
Now all such Pradeshas or Vargas as have force greater by an Avibhága Pratichchheda than the Pradesha or Varga in the last Varganá of the first Spardhaka will make the first Varganá of second Spardhaka. The number of Vargas will be less by a common difference. The following chart will show the lesser number of Varganás in each Spardhaka and Gunaháni:1st (2nd 3rd 4th 5th Gunaháni. 256 128 64 32

230. An innumerable part of a (linear) finger (is) the measure of increase of minimum Spardhakas (from one vibratory division to another). Leaving six intervals, (as stated in Gatha following), (we thus proceed) from the minimum to the maximum (vibratory division).
Commentary. The measure of increases of degrees of vibration from one vibratory division to another till the maximum vibratory division is equal to the number of spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. Minimum vibratory division is found at the birth time of completely undevelopable fine common soul. The second division will be found by adding the degrees stated above.

Commentary. The number of intervening vibratory divisions between two new Spardhakas is an innumerable part of a basic line of universe.

232. We give the quantity of these (three kinds of) vibratory divisions of 14 soul-classes with regard to minimum and maximum (e. e.,) 84 (classes).
Commentary. There are three kinds of vibratory divisions, (1) Upapada-Yoga Sthána- birth vibratory division, (2) Ekántánu-vriddhi Yoga Sthána, increasing vibratory divisions, (3) Parináma Yoga Sthána changing vibratory divisions. Each of the fourteen soul-classes are of these three kinds. Taking their minimum and maximum, 84 classes in all have been described in the following Gathas : -

Similarly is (33) the maximum (increasing vibratory division of one-sensed), fine (undevelopable), and (34) of fine (potentially undevelopable); then (35) the maximum of gross (undevelopables) and gross (potentially developable). (Then there is first) interval, (in which there are increasing vibratory divisions, the number of which is an innumerable part of the basic line of the universe, and which are found in no soul. It only means that there is an addition of so many increasing vibratory divisions to the 36th division before we multiply it by an innumerable part of a Palya to obtain the next division). (The 37th division is) the minimum changing (vibratory division) of (one-sensed) fine undevelopable souls (and 38) of (one-sensed) other (i. e., gross undevelopable) and (39) (40) the maximum (of these two respectively). Then again (there is the second) interval (of the same extent as above). Then the (41) (42) (43) and (44), (2 minimum and 2 maximum changing divisions of those (i. e., one-sensed fine and gross potentially) developables. Beyond this (there is the third) interval (of the same extent as above), (then in their order come from (45) to (54) the minimum of the five mobile, i. e., 2, 3, 4 and 5 irrational and 5 rational) completely undevelopable (souls and then their five) maximum increasing vibratory divisions.
(Then is the fourth interval of the same extent as above. Then come from (55) to (64) the 5 minimum and 5 maximum) changing (vibratory divisions of the 5 mobiles) completely undevelopable. (Then the 5th interval as above). (Then from (65) to (74) the 5 minimum and 5 maximum) increasing (vibratory divisions) of (the mobile) potentially developables. Then the sixth interval as above).

The maximum birth vibratory division of a 5-sensed rational developable soul is Innumerable part of a Palya times the minimum increasing vibratory division of a one-sensed the fine completely undevelopable soul.
Note that in the Chart above undevelopable means completely undevelopable and developable includes potentially developable.
अवरुक्कस्सेण हवे उववादेयं तवढिठाणाणं ।
एकसमयं हवे पुरा इदसिं जाव अट्ठोत्ति ॥ २४२ ॥ अवरोत्कृष्टेन भवेत् उपपादैकान्तवृद्धिस्थानानाम् । एकसमयो भवेत् पुनः इतरेषां यावदष्ट इति ॥ २४२ ॥
212. The minimum and maximum duration of the continuing of a birth or increasing vibratory division is one instant. And of the others (i. e. of changing vibratory divisions) is (two) to 8 instants.
Commentary.
This is evident because the birth vibratory division is confined to the first instant of the birth; and an increasing vibratory division also lasts for one instant, because there is an increase in it every instant. A changing vibratory division lasts at least for 2 instants and its maximum duration is 8 instants.

243. (The changing vibratory divisions which have the maximum duration) of 8 instants are the fewest. And on both the sides of this duration up to (the vibrations which last for) four instants, (each division has) an innumerable times of the preceding one. And above that (are) the vibratory divisions, (the duration of which is) three or two instants'.

Let the total number of souls=1422; of divisions-32; Náná Gunaháni or number of series--8; 1 Gunaháni or 1 of the series=4 divisions. Of Nana Gunahánis, 3 are lower, and 3 are upper.
Therefore their Anyonyábhyasta Ráshi respectively-are 23 and 25 or 8+32 i. e., 40 in all.

In the middle of these 2 Gunahánis there is the 20th vibratory division. The number of souls will be greatest in it. In the barley like shape, it will be the middle part.

64434454- 711 –128. This 128+ twice the Gunahánis or (2x 4 i. e., )8 16, gives the common difference for this 1st Gunaháui. Then the numbers gained are 128, 112, 96, and 80.
Total=416 in the 1st Gunaháni. The other 4 upper Gunahánis will each be half of the preceding

251. From the minimum (changing vibratory) place of a two-sensed developable to the maximum (changing vibratory place) of a (five-sensed) rational developable, the vibratory places gradually increase (at an uniform rate). सेढियसंखेज्जदिमा तस्स जहराणस्स फट्ट्या होंति । अंगुल संखभागा ठाणं पडि फट्ट्या उडा ॥ २५२ ॥ श्रेण्यसंख्येयमानि तस्य जघन्यस्य स्पर्द्धकानि भवन्ति । अङ्गुलासंख्य भागानि स्थानं प्रति स्पर्द्धकानि वृद्धानि ॥ २५२ ॥
252. The Spardhakas of the minimum (changing vibratory place) of that (i. e., 2-sensed developable) are an innumerable part of the basic line (of universe). And with each place the Spardhakas increase by an innumerable part of a (linear) finger.

254. (The number of) the 1st being subtracted from that of the last and the (remainder) being divided by the (uniform) increase plus one (gives the total number of) the places. And these continuous vibratory places (are) an innumerable part of the (basic) line (of the universe).

And these places with interval, without interval(and mixed) (are each an innumerable part of the basic line of universe). And the total (of the three) also (is an innumerable part of the basic line of universe).
Commentary. This is so because there are many đifferent kinds of innumerables.

256. The minimum (birth) vibratory (place) (is the vibratory place) in the first instant of the last of 6012 mean births of, a fine common (completely) undevelopable (soul).
And the maximum is (the maximum changing vibratory place) of a five-sensed rational developable (soul).
Commentary. See the chart to Gatha 241, number 1 is the minimum and number 84 is the maximum as said above.
(The causes of the 4 kinds of Bondage). जोगा पयडिपदेसा ठिदिअणुभागा कसायदो होति । अपरिणदुच्छिण्णेसु य बंधहिदिकारणं णत्थि ॥ २५७॥ योगात्प्रकृतिप्रदेशौ स्थित्यनुभागौ कषायतो भवतः । अपरिणतोच्छिन्नेषु च बन्धः स्थितिकारणं नास्ति ॥ २५७ ॥
257. Nature (Prakriti), and molecules (Pradesha) of bondage are caused by vibrations (Yoga); and duration (sthiti), and fruition (Anubhága), by passions. In (the 11th stage of subsided delusion, Upshántamoha, where passion Karma exists in a passive condition and does not operate, i. e., is) not subject to modification, and in the 12th and 13th stages of destroyed, delusion, Kashina-moha, and vibratory omniscience, Sayoga Kevali, i. l., where the passions are) quite destroyed, there is no cause of duration-bondage ; and (in the 14th stage of non-vibratory omniscience there is no bondage).
Commentary. What kinds of Karma and with how many molecules are bound to the soul is determined by its vibratory activity ; how long these molecules will continue to bind the soul and the strong or mild character of their fruition is determined by the passion which colours that vibratory activity. In the 11th stage passions are entirely subsided, i. e., although they exist, they settle down into non-operation. In the 12th stage they are entirely destroyed, i. e., they

GOMMATASARA.
entirely fall off from the soul. In the 13th stage also they are nonexistant, as binding the soul. In all these 3 stages, passion is either entirely absent or entirely inactive. Therefore the duration and fruition bondages which are due to passion do not arise. But in all the three stages, vibration (Yoga) exists, therefore Karmas are created. The duration is of the simplest and shortest kind, i. e., of one-instant only. The fruition also lasts only for one instant and is therefore necessarily very intense and concentrated. The nature Prakriti is also only of the pleasure-feeling class (Sátá-vedaniya). The normal duration bondage (Sthiti Bandha) is for one-antar-muhúrta. This does not take place here. Therefore it is said that there is no duration-bondage here. In the non-vibratory omniscience, i. e., the 14th stage, there is neither passion nor vibration and consequently there is none of the four kinds of bondages. It should be remembered that the 14th stage is of very short duration. It really means the transition of the perfect soul from its mundane condition to the condition of liberation.

149
258. All vibratory divisions are an innumerable part of the basic line (of universe). And the collection (or number of) all the ultimate classes (Prakriti) of Karmas is an innumerable times of those.

Commentary.
Vibratory divisions are of three kinds, without-interval (Nirantara) and with interval (Sántara) and mixed. They are an innumerable part of basic line of universe, but the ultimate classes of Karmas are those multiplied by innumerable times the innumerable spatial units of the universe. It is so, because there are innumerable kinds of thought-activities with reference to ignorance and intense or mild passions in mundane souls. Scriptural-knowledge-obscuring sub-class alone has many innumerable divisions, as the different kinds of knowledge due to their destructive-subsidence is of innumerable kinds.

The operation of assimilative (Áháraka body and limbs sub-classes of body making Karma is) only in the imperfect (vow, i.e., the 6th stage); of the Tirthankara (sub-class), in the (13th and 14th stages of vibratory and non-vibratory) omniscient; of the mixed (right-and-wrongbelief, mishra sub-class of the right belief deluding Karma) in (the 3rd or) mixed (stage); of (the slightly clouded rightbelief (Samyaktva sub-class of right-belief deluding Karma), in (the, 4 i. e., 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th stages of) destructivesubsidential right belief (Vedak Samyaktva); and of (the 4) migratory (Ánupúrví forms, sub-classes of body-making Karma) in the (1st) two (i.e.,) wrong-belief (and downfall) and in (the 4th, i. e.,) vowless (right-belief stage).

262. The soul in the downfall (Sásádana) belief does not go to hell, therefore (there is) no (operation of) hellish migratory form in it.

Commentary. Out of 148 sub-classes of 8 Karmas only 122 operate. 26 are not taken into consideration, with reference to operation. These 26 are the following sub-classes of the body-making Karma.5 bondage (Bandhana) 5 interfusion (Sanghata), and 6 of the 20 sub-divisions of touch, taste, smell and colour, because only one of each of these 4 operate at a time. The bondage and interfusion subclasses are bound and operate along with the five body sub-classes of the body-making Karma, they therefore are not counted separately.
Out of these 122, nine operate in an exceptional way. They are mentioned in Gathas 261 and the 1st half of 262. The remaining 113 are dealt with in the last part of Gatha 262.

263. The operation-cessation-(Udaya-Vyuchchhitti) of ten; four; one; seventeen; eight; and five; and four; six; six; one; two; two and fourteen; twenty-nine; and thirteen takes place at the end of the fourteen stages respectively).
Commentary. In the 12th stage of destroyed delusion, operation-cessation of 2 and 14 sub-classes is mentioned. It means that two sub-classes cease to operate in the last but one, and fourteen in the last instant, as given in Gatha 270. . This discription is in accordance with the view of the saint Vrishabháchárya, the author of Máhá Dhavala which is also called Kashaya Prabhrita.
पण णवइगि सत्तरसं अड पंच च चउर छक्क छच्चेव । इगिदुग सोलस तीसं बारस उदये अजोगंता ॥ २६४ ॥ पञ्च नवैकं सप्तदशाष्ट पञ्च च चतस्रः षट्कं षट् चैव । एकद्विकं षोडश त्रिंशत् द्वादश उदये प्रयोगान्ताः ॥ २६४ ॥

264. Five, nine, one, seventeen, eight, five, four, six, six, one, two, sixteen, thirty and twelve (cease to) operate (from the 1st stage) to the end of the non-vibratory omniscient (i. e., the 14th stage respectively).
Commentary. This account of the operation-cessation of the sub-classes is according to the saint Bhútabali, the author of Dhavala. The de tailed exposition which follows is based upon this.
It is worth noting that premature-operation (Udírna) of the sub-classes also ceases in the different stages. This premature operation-cessation is the same as the operation cessation for the 1st 6 stages except that the human age and pleasure and pain-feeling Karmas cease their premature-operation at the end of the sixth, although their operation goes on further. After the 6th stage, i. e., from the 7th onward up to the 13th the cessation of operation and premature-operation is different in the different stages as given in the chart below. In the 14th stage there is no premature operation.
The premature-operation of the human age and the pleasure and pain-feeling sub-classes of Karmas ceases at the end of 6th stage of imperfect vows, because a saint with perfect vows, i. e., in the 7th and higher stage, is not subject to accidental or other similar premature-death. Also in the 7th and higher stages, which are stages of concentration, the soul does not feel pleasure or pain although they exist in the form of operation of the Karmas on their maturity. But there is no hastening of the maturity and therefore of operation. In other words there is no premature Avipáka, but only mature or Savipáka shedding or Nirjará of these three subclasses of Karmas in the 7th and the higher stages.
The insensibility to pleasure and pain in these stages relates only to worldly feelings. The soul being in near touch with its own character feels the bliss which is its own eternal attribute and which is merely suppressed on account of the load of Karmas in Sansára.

पट्ठा य रायदोसा इंदियणाणं च केवलिम्हि जदो। तेण दु सादासादजसुहदुक्खं णत्थि इंदियजं ॥ २७३ ॥ नष्टौ च रागद्वेषौ इन्द्रियज्ञानं च केवलिनि यतः । तेन तु सातासातजसुखदुःखं नास्ति इन्द्रियजम् ॥ २७३ ।।
273. Because in the omniscient, attachment and aversion, and sensitive-knowledge are destroyed, therefore (in him) there is no happiness or misery due to the pleasure and pain (feeling Karmas), which are caused by the senses.
समयष्टिदिगो बंधो सादस्सुदयप्पिगो जदो तस्स । तेण असादस्सुदओ सादसरूवेण परिणमदि ॥२७४॥ समयस्थितिको बन्धः सातस्योदयात्मको यतः तस्य । तेनासातस्योदयः सातस्वरूपेण परिणमति ॥ २७४ ॥
274. Because in omniscient, the bondage of one instant duration of the pleasure (feeling Karma) is simultaneous with the operation of it, therefore the operation of the pain (feeling Karma), takes the same form as the pleasure feeling Karma.
Commentary. In omniscients, pleasure-feeling Karma with highest intensity of fruition flows in and is shed off after operation at every instant, therefore the Karmic molecules of pain-feeling Karma of very mild fruition are submerged in the most pleasant fruition of pleasure feeling Karma. It is a rule that one of the two feeling Karmas can operate at one time; therefore no pain can ever be felt by the omniscients.
एदेण कारणेण दु सादस्सेव दुणिरंतरो उदओ। तेणासादणिमित्ता परीसहा जिणवरे णत्थि ॥ २७५ ॥ एतेन कारणेन तु सातस्यैव तु निरन्तर उदयः । तेनासातनिमित्ताः परीषहा जिनवरे न सन्ति ॥ २७५ ॥
275. And it is for this reason that there is continuous operation of the pleasure-feeling Karma only; therefore the (11) sufferings which have the pain-feeling Karma as their auxiliary cause are not found in the (omniscient) Conqueror.

Commentary. In the residentials, peripatetic, and stellar celestials, and the female heavenly celestials, there is no celestial migratory form in the 4th stage; because a right-believer, dying there, is not reborn as a residential, pripatetic, stellar or female heavenly celestial.

In the 5 embodiments (i. e., earth, water, fire, air and vegetable, the operative sub-classes are 80), as in the one-(sensed beings, but there is) no (operation of) common (in the earth embodiment); of this (i.e., common) and hot light, (in the water embodiment); of those two (i. e., common, hot light) and of cold light in the (next) two (i.e. fire and air embodiments). In the last in order (i.e., in the vegetable embodiment, deduct only) hot light. (Thus there operate 79, 78, 77, 77 and 79, respectively, in the 1st five embodiments).

322. In anger (generally), from the (122 of the) stages deduct (the 13, 2. e.) Tírthankara, the 4 (kinds of) pride, deceit, and greed, (each, i. e., in all 109 operate). (In the wrong-belief stage in anger, only 105 operate, i. e., the 109, minus mixed belief, clouded-right-belief and the two assimilative body and limbs). (But in that stage), in the absence of error-feeding (anger, there is) no (operation of the 14, 2. e.,) one (sensed), not-all (in e., 2 to 4 sensed), hot light, error-feeding anger, the (4) migratory forms, the 4 immobile, (fine, common and undevelopable), (i. e., in all 91 operate).
Commentary. But this last condition happens only when a soul having transformed the error-feeding into the lesser passions goes up the subsidential ladder to the 11th stage, and then falls down to the first by the operation of wrong.belief Karma. Then he has no error-feeding anger, although he is in wrong-belief stage. In anger 109 operate as below:

sub-classes operate) as in their respective stages. (But there is) no (operation of) clouded right belief in (the stages where there is) subsidential or destructive (rightbelief); and in (the stages where there is) subsidential rightbelief (there do) not (operate the 5, i. e.,) the first three migratory forms, (i. e., all except celestial) and the two assimilative (body and limbs).
Commentary.
The above is explained by two supplementary Gathas* in the Sanskrit Commentary. Souls do not die in the 3rd or mixed stage, during vibration of the assimilative mixed with physical body, in the stages of destructive ladder, when ascending the first part of New thought-activity in the subsidential ladder, in the first subsidential right-belief, in the 7th hell Mahátamah having acquired the attribute of right-belief and continuing in it.
199
But in the Sanskrit Commentary page 475, Calcutta Edition, Mishra is translated potentially developable soul. Both the meanings seem correct, because the soul does not die either in the 3rd stage, or in the potentially developable condition.
In this last condition the soul is really a developable soul, but the completion of the capacity to develope fully is effected in one antar muhúrta and the condition of being potentially developable lasts within that Antar-muhúrta only. If death should occur within that Antar-muhúrta, the soul would be called not potentially developable, but completely undevelopable.
And there is no death for one Antar-muhúrta for a soul with second subsidential right-belief having come down to the 1st stage of wrong-belief and whose error-feeding passions have already been transformed into lesser passions.
Also there is no death for a soul who is on the point of destroying the right-belief deluding Karma but has not completely destroyed it, so long as he does not become successful destructive-subsidential right-believer (Krit-kritya Vedaka Samyakdrishți). All these 8 steps (are) other than (death) occasions.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Tu in the last line means that a soul which has already bound celestial age-Karma and then ascends the subsidential ladder and
s up to the 11th stage, i.e., the top rung of the subsidential ladder, and then falls down, can die while descending to the 8th and after death in transmigration, it is in the 4th stage. In the above circumstances a soul has the second subsidential right-belief, and so there is the operation of the celestial migratory form only, i. e., its next birth can be only in the celestial condition.
खाइयसम्मो देसो गर एव जदो तहिं ण तिरियाऊ । उज्जोवं तिरियगदी तेसिं अयदम्हि वोच्छेदो ॥३२६ ॥ क्षायिकसम्यग् देशो नर एव यतस्तस्मिन् न तिर्यगायुः । उद्योतः तिर्यग्गतिस्तेषामयते व्युच्छेदः ॥ ३२६ ॥
329. The destructive right-believer in (5th stage of) partial vow is a human only; therefore in it (there is) no Toperation of the 3, i. e.,) sub-human age, cold light and sub-human condition. Of these (there is operation).cessation in the (4th stage of) vowless (right belief).
Commentary. In liberation quest like the stages, 122 operate in 14 stages in the capables and 117 in incapables, Abhavya, who have only stage of wrong-belief.

203
Thus the operation of sub-classes in the quests, should be known.
(All) this is told or described by Nemichandra, adored by Baldeo and Mádhava Chandra.
Commentary.

There is a slight pun upon the name Nemi Chandra. The author seems to be very fond of it. It arises from the triple circumstances (1) that the temple in which the Great-Gommatasára was composed at the Hill Chandragiri at Shravanabelgola, contains a beautiful and impressive image of Lord Neminath, the 22nd Tirthankara. A representation of this temple and of the author preaching Gommatasára to Chámunḍaráya, the royal builder of the temple is given at page of XXXVIII Dravya Sangrah, S.B.J., Vol. I-1917; (2) that the author's name also was Nemi Chandra. As is well known, Lord Nemi Nath belonged to the clan of Yádavas in Káthiavára, during the time of the Pándavas. He was an elder cousin of the two brothers Baldeo and Krishna. Lord Nemi Nath was worshipped by these two brothers. Therefore the teaching in Gommatasára may be said to be the teaching of Lord Nemi Nath who was adored by Bal (i. e., Baldeo or Balbhadara) and Mádhava Chandra (i.e., Krishna or Nárayana), as every Tirthankara always preaches the same Jain Siddhánta or Truth. (3) And that it so chanced that our author had a brother who also bore the name of Baldeo, and a pupil whose name chanced to be Mádhava Chandra, Traividyadeva. Both these paid great reverence to Nemi Chandra, Siddhánta Chakravarti. Thus the Gathas of Gommatasára are said to be by Nemi Chandra adored by Baldeo and Mádhava Chandra.

333. In wrong belief, etc., (i. e., the first) 3 (stages of wrong-belief, downfall and mixed. there is existence of all the 148 sub-classes, but in the first), Tírthankara and assimilative (body and limbs) do not co-exist; (in the 2nd) all (these 3 do not exist at any time); and (in the 3rd) the Tirthankara (sub-class does not exist), (because) in the souls in which these sub-classes can exist, these stages are not possible.
Commentary. Thus in one soul in the 1st stage there can be 147 or 146 at a time, in the 2nd, 145, in the 3rd 147 in existence. Although obviously 148 exist, in the first stage, in some souls collectively at a given time, but all the 148 sub-classes can not exist in one soul at one time. A soul in which the Tírthankara or assimilative body and limbs is in existence is never in the 2nd stage, i. e., it never falls down from right-belief to wrong-belief through the intervention of the second stage, on account of the operation of any of the 4 error-feeding passions. A soul in which the Tirthankara sub-class is in existence, can never touch the 3rd stage, to which a soul would not ascend, in the first instance, from the first stage, but which it may reach while falling down to it from the 4th, or during an ascent, after falling down from the 4th to the first. In other words the soul which has already bound the Tirthankara sub-class can never have mixed right and wrong-belief.

334. Right-belief can arise on the bondage of (any of the) 4 ages in (any of the) 4 conditions. (But the soul) does not acquire the partial vows (of the 5th) and the full vows (of the 6th and 7th stages) except (when it binds) the celestial age-Karma.
Commentary. This is so because in the soul who has got bondage of the other 3 ages the thought-paint in a soul, with bondage of either of the

335-336. During the existence of hellish. sub-human or celestial age, ( there can be ) no partial vow, total vow, or destructive (ladder, stage, respectively).

And the soul in (any of the four) vowless (partial vow, imperfect-vow, and perfect vow stages), at the end. of advanced-thought (attainment Anivritti Karana Labdhi) having simultaneously transformed the (4) error (feeding passions into the lesser passions), and then having passed successively the (numerable) many parts of advanced thought (attainment ), destroys respectively the wrongbelief, the mixed (right-and-wrong-belief), (clouded ) rightbelief.
Commentary.
Destructive right-belief (Ksháyika Samyaktva) arises on the destruction of 7 sub-classes of Karmas, namely, the 4 error-feeding passions, wrong belief, mixed-right-andwrong-belief, and clouded-right-belief, in one of the four stages of vowless right-belief, partial vows, imperfectvows and perfect-vows, i. e., in the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th stages. This destruction is effected through advanced thought-activity. called Anivritti- Karana, the third kind of the fifth Labdhi which is technically called Karana.



Page #271
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

208
THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
This attainment takes 3 forms, lower or initial thoughtactivity (Adhah-Karana), new-thought-activity (ApúrvaKarana), and advanced-thought-activity (Anivritti Karana). It must be noticed that although the last two activities give their names respectively to the 8th and 9th stages, yet they are not confined to them. The two stages are so called, because the conduct deluding passions are subjected to subsidence or destruction in the 8th and 9th stages, peculiarly and especially, by the new and advanced thoughtactivity. This will be seen to be in the fitness of things, because a rise and entry into the 8th stage can be made only by a soul who has obtained perfect right-belief by the subsidence or destruction of the 7 sub-classes mentioned above, which include all the 3 sub-classes which vitiate right-belief. The initial thought-activity or Adhah-Karana for subsidence or destruction of the conduct-deluding passions begins and ends in the 7th stage.
But these 3 thought activities also characterise the destruction of right-belief-deluding Karma, and the transformation of the error-feeding-passions into lesser passions in the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th stage.
These are also necessary for gaining subsidential rightbelief, at the end of the first stage, and the second subsidential right-belief in the 7th stage,
The order in which the seven sub-classes are destroyed is as follows:
After being successively subjected to the action of the initial, the new and the advanced-thought-activity, the four error-feeding-passions are transformed at the last instant of the advanced-thought-activity into the 12 lesser passions. The three-thought-activities commence action again, after an interval of one Antar-muhúrta.
The duration of each of these 3 as also of the total of the three is an Antar-muhúrta varying from an Ávalí and

one instant, to 48 minutes minus one instant. When the whole Antar-muhúrta of this renewed advanced-thoughtactivity has elapsed, except one numerable part of it, then in this last numerable part the wrong belief, mixed and clouded belief sub-classes are successively destroyed. Thus it is, that the great destructive right belief, which is a sure and certain precursor of early Liberation is attained.
209
Thus in the 1st stage, there is existence of 148 subclasses. But Tirthankara sub-class is repugnant to the pair of assimilative body and limbs in this stage. Therefore, actually there is the existence only of 147 or 146 in a soul at a time. But the same soul may at one time have 146, and at some other, 147 in the first stage. For example, suppose a soul has 147 in existence; and having transformed the two assimilative body and limbs, it binds the hellish age, then rises to the 4th stage of vowless-right-belief, and there binds the Tirthankara Karma and then falls back to the 1st stage for going to the 2nd or 3rd hell, he would then have 146 in existence. In the second, none of the above three exist, i.e., there are only 145.
.In the 3rd, 147, i. e., all the 148 except the Tirthankara exist.
In the 4th, all the 148 exist, except in a destructive right-believer who has destroyed the 7 mentioned above and has 141 only.
In the 5th, 147 or 140 exist as in the 4th stage minus the hellish age.
In the 6th, there exist 146 or 139, as in 5th minus the sub-human age.
In the 7th, 146 or 139, exist as in the 6th.

In the 8th, in the subsidential ladder 145, exist, i. e., all except the hellish, sub-human and celestial ages but in a destructive right believer 138 exist and in the destructive ladder there exist 138, i. e., 145-the 7 mentioned above.

343. In effecting the subsidence (of the remaining twenty-one conduct-deluding passions there is a fixed order) as in destructive (ladder), but (the subsidence is in this order; common inclination, female inclination, then the first six minor passions, laughter, etc., male inclination, partial and total-vow-preventing anger, perfect-conductpreventing anger, partial and total vow-preventing pride, perfect conduct preventing pride, partial and total vowpreventing deceit, perfect conduct-preventing deceit, partial and total vow-preventing greed, perfect right-conductpreventing greed, but of the gross kind;-this is the order of subsidence in the ninth stage of subsidential ladder. In the tenth stage of the same ladder, there is the subsidence of the remaining perfect right conduct-preventing greed, i.e., of fine or slight greed (Súkhshama Lobha, viz.) between male (inclination) and perfect right-conduct preventing passions, the middle pairs (namely the partial and total vow-preventing passions) of anger etc. are successively subsided.
Commentary.
But when a Karma is bound, it must remain in that state for one Ávalí called Achalávalí, that is for an Ávalí it remains unmoving (Achala) or fixed, i. e. it has no operation, subsidence or destruction. This is only for duration-bondage which is due to passion in which the minimum duration is one Antar muhúrta, i.e., at least one Ávalí and one instant. But in the bondage merely due to vibrations, i. e., in the eleventh stage of subsidence and twelfth stage of destruction and thirteenth stage of vibratory omniscience there is only nominal duration of one instant, because the Karma comes to bind and operate, and leave the soul in the same instant. Thus there is no question of an Achalávalí there.

Now let us go back to the subsidence, of any of the twenty-one passions. This subsidence is only of the Karmas bound at least one Avali ago. What as to the matter bound within this Avali? The answer is that the subsidence of this matter will be effected later along with the subsidence of the matter of the other sub-classes which follow in the order given above. For example the matter of the Achlávali of male inclination will subside along with the subsidence of the partial and total vow-preventing anger. णिरयादिसु पयडिहिदिअणुभागपदेसभेदभिएणस्स । सत्तस्स य सामित्तं णेदव्वमिदो जहाजोग्गं ॥ ३४४ ॥ निरयादिषु प्रकृतिस्थित्यनुभागप्रदेशभेदभिन्नस्य । सत्त्वस्य च स्वामित्वं नेतव्यमितो यथायोग्यम् ॥ ३४४ ॥
344. After this, the inherence (Svamitva) of existence of (the matter bound in the bondage of four) different distinctions of class, duration, fruition and molecule should be considered as proper in the (different quests as) hellish condition, etc. तिरिए ण तित्थसत्तं णिरयादिसु तिय चउक्क चउ तिरिण।

345. (There is) no existence of Tirthankara in subhuman (condition). And in the hellish, etc. (i.e., in hellish, sub-human, human and celestial conditions); there is (existence) of three (except celestial), 44, and 3 (except hellish) ages (respectively). The existence in the remaining (quests) should be known according to the stages.
Commentary. Age Karma is of two kinds: the one which we are consuming, viz, current (Bhujyamána); and the one which is bound for the next incarnation, viz. bound (Badhyamána). In the hellish condition, the 3 (ages) are: current hellish age and the bound subhuman aud human. In the sub-human, the 4 are:- the current subhuman, and all the four bound; In the human, the current human

and all the four bound : In the celestial, the current celestial, and the bound sub-human and human; This is with reference to several souls considered at one time. But in any one soul in any one condition of existence there can be the existence of only two, its current age and the next age bound by it; although a hellish or celestial soul can bind only a human or sub-human age; and a human or sub-human soul can bind any one of all the four ages.

In all the (senses and embodiments) there is untwist. ing (Udvelaná) also of the sub-classes).
Commentary. Udvelaná literally untwisting - is a technical term for transforming the bound Karmie matter of one class into another class. This is like the Visanyojana mentioned in note to Gatha 336,
Visanyojana, Udvelná, and Sankramana are alike in this, that the matter of one sub-class of Karma is changed into that of another. But the difference is this that Visanyojana is effected only by means of the three special thought-activity attainments(Karana-labdhi; viz. Adhah Karana,lower thought-activity, Apúrva Karana, new thoughtactivity, and Anivritti Karaŋa,advanced-thought-activity, see note to Gatha 336 above). In Udvelaná the matter of the bound sub-class is. 80 to speak, unbound or twisted back and is then transformed into

another sub-class, without the help of the special three thoughtactivities. In Sakramana there is neither the untwisting, nor the three special thought-activities but simple transformation of the matter of one into that of another sub-class.
221
N.-B.-No necessity of chart. In one to 4-sensed and earth, water and vegetable bodied there are 2 stages 1st and 2nd, in fire and air bodies only one stage of wrong-belief.

350. The two assimilative (body and limbs), clouded belief, mixed (belief), the two celestial (condition and migratory form), the 4 hellish (condition and migratory form and fluid body and limbs), high family and the two human (condition and migratory form, (these 13 sub-classes) are gradually untwisted by souls, (i.e., are transformed in the Udvelaná mode).

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. Thus a soul in all four conditions, in the wrong-belief stage and with painful thought-activity, having no existence of Tirthankara, hellish and celestial age Karmas, has the existence of 145. On untwisting the first two, viz., assimilative body and limbs, there is the existence of 143; again on untwisting the clouded-right belief, it retains 142; and then on untwisting the mixed belief, the existence is of 141. This is in their own place.
In the one to four-sensed and in the earth, water, and vegetable embodiments 145 exist, but if there is untwisting of the first two, three, four, six or ten, then there is existence of 143, 142, 141 in the birth instant (Utpanna Sthána), and of 139 and 135 respectively in their own place (Sva Sthána).
In the two, fire and air enbodiments, 144 exist, viz., all the 148 except the four, Tírthankara, hellish, celestial and human age. And on untwisting the first two, three, four, six or ten, in the birth instant (Utpanna Sthána), they have the existence of 142, 141, 140, 138, 134. On further untwisting in their own places of the high family or of high family and the human condition and migratory form they have existence of 133 and 131 respectively.
The last two existences of 133 and 131 are also found in the birth instant (Utpanna Sthána) of one, two, three and four-sensed and earth, water, and vegetable embodiment. The one-sensed, etc., refer to the sense-quest and earth, etc., to the embodiment-quest.

352. In the eleven vibrations of the developable (i.e., four of mind, four of speech, and three of body, i.e., physical, fluid and assimilative), and in (the vibration of) the assimilative mixed (with physical body the existence is) as in their stages (viz. of 148); the same in (the vibration of) fluid mixed (with karmic body), but (in it there is) no (existence of) human and sub-human ages (viz., 146 exist).

Commentary. Here Sattva Sthana or existence place means the number of subclasses which can exist in a soul at a time at a given instant. This number may remain the same, but sub-classes forming the number may change. The different ways in which this can happen are called the different divisions (or Bhangas) of existence.

365. All (i. e., 148) minus two, three, six, seven, eight, nine, eleven, seventeen, nineteen, and twenty-one exist in the wrong-belief ( stage in the soul), which has bound ageKarma (for the next incarnation ). In the other (viz., in the soul which has not bound its next age-Karma there would be) one (further) less, (in each ).
Commentary.
Thus there are 20 existence places but two of them are similar, therefore 18 places are counted.

This is in a wrong believer having bound hellish age going to the 4th stage with the destructive-subsi| dential right-belief, there binding the Tirthankara sub-class, but then coming down to the 1st stage of wrong-belief, one Antar-muhúrta before his death.
Note 1. But there is no beginning to bind the Tírthankara Karma in a soul, with a current human age and the next bound human or sub-human age.
Note 2.-A human soul who has bound the next celestial age, and is in the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th stage, never falls down to the first.
Note 3.- A hellish soul, who has bound the next human age, and has also Tírthankara Karma in existence, is never in this stage of wrong-belief for 6 months before death, as the ceremonies of conception begin in the Middle Region for those 6 months. Such a soul has the existence of 146, but is in the 4th stage for the 6 months.

145, all but the 2 ages which are neither current nor bound and the Tirthankara, here are 5 divisions. There are 12 possible combinations as human and sub-human can bind any of the four ages, but celestial and hellish can bind only either human or sub-human ages.

The soul in (13) B7 instead of the Udvelaná of the 2 in (13) B.7. here effects Udvelaná of 8, i. e., of the hellish and celestial conditions and migratory forms, and of fluid body, limbs, bondage and fusion. Thus it has 131 instead of 137 of (13) B7. Then dies and is born as 5 sensed sub-human. And as there is no bound age, there are 130 only. In its developable state it binds 6, i. e., the above 8 except the 2 hellish condition and migratory form. Thus it has 136.
136, the same soul, in the last, dies and is born a human with 130, and binds 6, i. e., celestial condition and migratory form, fluid body, limbs, bondage and fusion.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Note that, Non-bound is just one less than the bound. There are 40 existence places and 120 divisions. The number of divisions in each place is given below the number of existing sub-classes in each.
The numbers in five places in the first row are with reference to the existence of Tirthankara Karma. The first place refers to all souls except sub-humans which have no existence of Tirthankara Karma, and have existence of 146 (148-sub-human and any other age). It has 4 divisions-(1) human age current, hellish age bound; (2) human age current, celestial age bound; (3) hellish age current, human age bound; (4) celestial age current, human age bound. It is noticeable that in these 4 divisions 2 same ages occur twice, and therefore in giving the number of divisions, only two are counted. The second place has 142 (148-4 error-feeding passions, sub-human age and any other age). The third place has 141 (142-wrong-belief). The 4th place has 140 (141-mixed belief). The 5th place has 139 (140-clouded-belief). Each of these four places has got 2 divisions only--(1) human age current, hellish age bound; (2) human age current, celestial age bound. As to five places of non-bound age Karma of the first row, the number is the same as in bound places minus bound-age Karma; but the divisions in each of the first two of 145 and 141, are three having regard to current hellish, human and celestial ages. The third place of 140 has one division of current human age. The 4th place of 139 has 3 divisions havia regard to current hellish, human or celestial age. A human who has begun destruction of deluding Karma, but has not completed it, can die and be born in hellish or celestial condition. The fifth place of 138 (viz. 148 minus 3 ages, and 7 Karmas preventing right-belief) has also 3 divisions with reference to current human, celestial and hellish ages. The soul with 138 is a destructive right-believer with Tírthankara Karma. He can either be a Tírthankara in current human age, in cases where he has bound Tírthankara Karma, with celebrations of at most three auspicious occasions of adoption of aus. terity, perfect knowledge and liberation; or he may go to heaven or hell and become Tírthankara in third birth as a man. Till six months before the expiry of their life-period, he will remain with-out bondage of human age; and will have existence of 138 sub-classes. -
The five places of the second row have Tírthankara Karma less in each. In the 2 places of 145 and 141 there are twelve divisions in each, like that in the place of 145 in wrong belief stage, but only five are counted (vide (3.) B. 2 in chart of wrong-belief). Each of the 3rd and 4th places of 140 and 139 has 4 divisions, i. e., current

human age, and bound all the four ages. Here only 3 are counted
ving current human age and bound human age. The 5th place 138 has 7 divisions (1) current hellish, and bound human age; (2) current sub-human and bound celestial age; (3) current human and bound hellish age; (4) current human and bound sub-human age: (5) both current and bound human age; (6) current human and bound celestial age; (7) current celestial and bound human age. Leaving out divisions which contain the samage, as current and bound and the same two ages again, only four divisions are counted. Each of the first two places of non-boundage in the second row 144 and 140, has 4 divisions, with reference to current four ages. The third place of 139 has only one division of current human age. Each of the 4th and 5th places of 138 and 137 has each four divisions with reference to current four ages.
All the ten places of the third row have the same number of divisions as the ten places of the first row, while the ten places of the fourth row have the same 37 divisions as ten places of the second row.
Thus there are altogether 120 divisions in 40 different places of existence of Karma sub-classes in vowless right-belief stage.
देसतियेसुवि एवं भंगा एकेक देसगस्स पुणो । पडिरासि बिदियतुरियस्सादीबिदियम्मि दो भंगा ॥३८२॥ देशत्रयेष्वपि एवं भङ्गा एकैकं देशकस्य पुनः। प्रतिराशि द्वितीयचतुर्थस्यादिद्वितीयस्मिन् द्वौ भङ्गौ ॥ ३८२॥
382. Similarly in (each of) the three (stages of) partial (vow, imperfect vow and perfect vow), (there are 40 places like those in vowless stage, but each place has) only one division; (there are) however, two divisions in each group of the first two places of second and fourth (row), in the (partial vow stage ).
Commentary. In the partial vow stage, in the bound places of 145 and 141 and non bound places 144 and 140 of second row, and in bound places of 141 and 137 and non-bound places of 140 and 136 in the fourth row each has two divisions, bound ones have 1) current human age and bound celestial age. (2) Current sub-human age and bound celestial age. Non-bound ones have current human and sub-human age. The remaining bound places in partial vow and all 20 bound places in the 6th and 7th stages have each one division current human age

and bound celestial age; while the other non-bound age places have each only one division of current human age.
Thus there are 48 divisions in partial vow and 40 in each of the 6th and 7th stage.

383. For new thought-activity (of the subsidential ladder) write four rows (of three places each containing 148 sub-classes) minus respectively two, six, and square of three (viz. nine). Deduct zero, one, four, and five (in each of the four rows respectively) for (age)-bound (and) for the other (ie., non-bound age) deduct one (from each).

384. (Three places of the first row ) should be known by deducting ( respectively, from 148 sub-classes) the hellish and sub-human ages, these two and first (viz. 4 error-feeding) passions, and (these six plus) three (right) belief—(deluding Karmas ) . ( In the three places of the second row, Tirthankara Karma should be deducted from each of the 3 places of the first row and in the three places of the third row deduct from each place of the first row, 4 Karmas, i. e., assimilative body and limbs, bondage and interfusion, and in the three places of the fourth row deduct from each place of the first row five viz. Tirthankara and 4 assimilative). (These 12 places) have each one division. (The same for non-bondage, 12 places).

Commentary. The 8th stage of subsidential ladder has 12 bondage and 12 nonbondage places with twenty four divisions, in all, as shown in chart below:

In bondage places the divisions refer to current human and bound celestial ages, and in non-bondage places to current human age only.

385. Similarly(there are twenty four places and twenty four divisions) in the (other) three (stages of) subsidential (ladder). For the new-thought-activity of destructive ladder, make four rows. (The first row having one place) with all (148 sub-classes) minus ten (viz. three ages, except the current one, and four error-feeding passions and three deluding Karmas), Deduct (from each) zero, one(viz., Tírthankara), four (viz. the four assimilative), and five (viz. Tírthankara and the four assimilative for places in the four rows). 138
Commentary. 137 184
Each of the 4 places have only one division of current 133 human age and there are four divisions, in all.

388. (There are) these (four) existence places (of the destructive new thought-activity), also in the (destructive) advanced thought-activity, but (there are eight places more also in each of the four rows) on account of the destruction of sixteen, eight, one, one, six, one, one, and one, (respectively, in each place).
Commentary.
Thus there are 36 places in the 9th stage of destructive ladder, as shown in the chart below:

387. Each (of the above places has) one division, but among the four places (of the four rows where) common sex-inclination has been destroyed, (there are) two divisions in (one place) in each of the second and fourth (rows in which there is) no (existence) of Tirthankara.

स्त्रीपुरुषोदयचटिते पूर्व षण्ढं क्षपयति स्त्री अस्ति । षण्ढस्योदये पूर्व स्त्रीक्षपितं षण्ढ मस्तीति ॥ ३८८ ॥
388. (This is so, because the soul) ascending (to destructive ladder), with operation of female or male (inclination), first destroys the common (inclination), (then there) is the existence of female (sex in the two places); (and the soul rising with) operation of common (sex inclination), first destroys the female (sex), (therefore there) is existence of common (sex in the aforesaid two places).
Commentary. Thus there are thirty six places and thirty eight divisions in advanced thought-activity stage of destructive ladder and there are 24 places and 24 divisions in this stage of subsidential ladder. 62 divisions in all are thus possible in the 9th stage. The common or feminine inclination is destroyed in the 4th or 5th place of each row just as the soul rises in the destructive ladder with male or female inclination or with common inclination. It is with reference to the second and fourth row, where Tirthankara sub-class does not . exist that we have the two extra divisions.
अणियट्टिचरिमठाणा चत्तारिवि एकहीण सुहमस्स। ते इगिदोषिणविहीणं खीणस्सवि होति ठाणाणि ॥ ३८६ ॥ अनिवृत्तिचरमस्थानानि चत्वार्यपि एकहीनं सूक्ष्मस्य । तानि एकद्विविहीनं क्षीणस्यापि भवन्ति स्थानानि ॥ ३८६ ॥
389. The last place (of each of the four rows) of the advanced thought-activity (stage should be taken) in (the 10th stage of)slightest(delusion),after deducting one (deceit from each). (Thus we have 4 places of 102, 101, 98, and 97 with 4 divisions there). The places of (the 12th stage) of destructive (delusion) are the same after deducting .one (greed up to last but one instant; and four places again after deducting therefrom) two (i. e., sleep and drowsiness). (Thus we have eight places in the 12th stage having 101, 100, 97, 96, 99, 98, 95 and 94. The divisions are eight).

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary.
In all the four stages of destructive ladder, and the two stages of omniscience, there is only current human age, and no age-Karma is bound; because the soul will be liberated from the same body. Therefore there can be only one division in each place having reference to non-bondage of age-Karma.
ते चोदसपरिहीणा जोगिस्स जोगिचरिमगेवि पुणो । बावत्तरिमडसद्धिं दुसु दुस हीसु दुगदुगा भंगा ॥ ३३० ॥ तानि चतुर्दशपरिहीनानि योगिन अयोगिचरमकेपि पुनः । द्वासप्ततिरष्टषष्टिः द्वयोर्द्वयोः हीनयोः द्विकद्विकौ भङ्गाः ॥ ३६० ॥
390. The (last four places of the 12th stage) after deducting(from each) fourteen (sub-classes, viz. five knowledge, and four conation-obscuring and five obstructive are taken) in (each of the 13th stage) of vibratory (omniscient ) and (the 14th stage) of non-vibratory (omniscient) till the last (but the two instants ). ( Thus we have 4 places having 85, 84, 81 and 80 sub-classes with 4 divisions for thirteenth and fourteenth stages, till the last but two instants). (In the last but one instant of the 14th stage, the first) two places will (each) be reduced by seventy-two, (and the other) two, (places) by sixty-eight (viz., 72 minus four assimilative). ( Thus there are four places of 13, 12, 13, 12. As two of the four places contain the same number of sub-classes, only two places should be counted) . ( At the end of the 14th stage, there are only two places of 13 and 12), each with two divisions, (because some have operation of pain-bearing and others of pleasure-bearing feeling Karma in each. Thus there are two places with four divisions).

391. There is no existence of (four) error-feeding (passions) in subsidential ladder, and those (in the 9th stage) of destructive ( ladder) first destroy eight (partial vow-preventing and total vow-preventing passions) and then destroy the (other) sixteen (sub-classes). This has been said by some (saints).
253
Commentary.
According to the view in the above Gatha four of bondage and four of non-bondage places will be deducted from the 24 mentioned above. The subsidentials will then have only 16 places instead of 24.
अयि गुिणहाणे मायारहिदं च ठाणमिच्छति । ठाणा भंग पमाणा केई एवं परूवेंति ॥ ३६२॥ अनिवृत्ति गुणस्थाने मायारहितं च स्थानमिच्छन्ति । स्थानानि भङ्गप्रमाणानि केचिदेवं प्ररूपयन्ति ॥ ३६२ ॥
392. Some describe (four places) by absence of deceit (also) in the advanced thought-activity stage. Some des - cribe the number of places and divisions (in the stages) as (follows).
अट्ठारह चउ अहं मिच्छतिये उवरि चाल चउठाये ।

(There are) eighteen, four, and eight places in the three wrong-belief (downfall and mixed stages respectively; and) after this for four stages (i. e., in the 4th 5th, 6th and 7th, each has ) forty (places ). In the three (stages), of subsidential (ladder, and) in (11th stage of) subsided delusion each has sixteen places; (and from the 8th stage of destructive ladder till the 14th there are four, forty, four, eight, four and six places respectively). पकारं छक्कदि वीस सयं दाल दुसु तालं । वीसडतिरणं वीसं सोलट्ठ य चारि श्रद्वेव ॥ ३६४ ॥

394. (There are) fifty, eleven, square of six (viz., 36), one hundred and twenty. forty eight, forty in each of two, .. twenty thirty-eight plus 20, i.e. 58), twenty, sixteen, eight, four, and eight (divisions respectively in fourteen stages).
Commentary. The difference between what has been said here and described before is as follows:
(1) In downfall stage, 12 places have been said before, here there is one less, as a soul with second subsidential rigat-belief having a bondage of celestial age coming down to downfall stage will not die here.
(2) In the eighth stage, 24 places have been described before in subsidential ladder. Only 16 have been mentioned here, by deducting 8 places having reference to existence of four error-f passions in bondage, and non-bondage, each. There are four places in the destructive ladder. Thus 20 have been mentioned here.
(3) In the 9th stage only 16 instead of the 24 mentioned before have been taken for subsidential ladder and after adding the 36 mentioned above and the four mentioned here in connection with absence of deceit, there are altogether 56 places and 53 divisions.
(4) In the 10th stage, only 16 instead of 24 as above for subsidential and 4 for destructive; 20 places in all, have been mentioned.
(5) In the 11th stage, only 16 instead of 24 have been mentioned.
एवं सत्तहाणं सवित्थरं वरिणयं मए सम्मं । जो पढइ सुणइ भावइ सो पावइ णिव्वुदि सोक्खं ॥३६५॥ एवं सत्त्वस्थान सविस्तरं वर्णितं मया सम्यक् । यः पठति शृणोति भावयति स प्राप्नोति निवृतिं सौख्यम् ॥३६॥
395. Thus existence places in detail have been properly described by me. He who reads, hears and meditates attains the happiness of Liberation.

398. After having heard all the scriptures in company of the Great Teacher Indranandi, the existence places have been described by the enlightened Teacher Kanakanandi.
जह चक्रेण य चक्की छक्खंडं साहियं अविग्घेण ।
तह मइचकेण मया छक्खंडं साहियं सम्मं ॥ ३६७ ॥ यथा चक्रेण च चक्रिणा षट्खण्डं साधितमविघ्नेन । तथा मतिचक्रेण मया षट्खण्डं साधितं सम्यक् ॥ ३६७ ॥
397. As a Chakravarti (monarch) conquers the six parts (of the Bharata Kshetra ) with (his) Chakra ( superhuman weapon) without any hindrance, so the six-fold (treatise) has been properly mastered by me with the Chakra of intelligence.

Commentary.
Here the author Shri Nemichandra refers to the six-fold treatise, given in Dhavala, Java Dhavala and Mahá Dhavala, the great scriptures in Prakrit and Sanskrit with 72,000, 60,000 and 40,000 Shlokas, respectively, still in manuscript at Múḍbidree (South Canara), on which this Gommatasára is based.
