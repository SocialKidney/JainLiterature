Something about This Publication o
We have already published 45 Aagams in Four languages Prakrut, Sanskrut (Satik), Hindi and Gujarati. Now a day for new generation & abroad living people, English translation has become a necessity. So we have planned to translate or compile Jain-Aagam in English. We gave priority to Nandi Sootra because it's known as wellbeing & auspicious sootra. The Theme of Nandi is knowledge; Nandi-sootra mainly describes five types of "F1A-(Jnanas)".
After that we have finished Niraayavalika panchak [Upang Sootra-19 to 23] and vipakshrut [Angsootra- 11] All these six Aagamas are related with Stories.
Now we are going to translate a Prakirnak-Sootra Named VEERSTAVA, in which Sootrakaar-Maharshi has narrated glorifications of jineshwar Mahaveer by 26- praising words. We didn't find any type of commentaries regarding this Aagam. So we have just given a brief detail of these glorified words.
Prakirnak-Sootra:-- In ancient times all the Aagams were divided in to two categories, Angpravishtha and Angbaahya. Angpravistha includes 12 Aagams & All the other Aagams were included in to Aangbaahya. After 13 centuary these Aagams were devided in the different style. Now a days as per 'Shwetamber" belief they are presented in six parts- Ang, Upang, Prakirnak, Chhed, Mool and Chulika. The mentioned Prakirnak "VEERSTAVA" is known as 10th prakirnak, in alternative of "MARANSAMAADHI" Prakirnak.
Here, we have compiled Translation done by Colonel D.S. Baya, which is originally edited in to Hindi by Dr. Subhash Kothari, We have two motives for publishing this book.[1] To provide Aagam literature in English & [2] It should be given in Microsoft Word format so people can do Cut, Paste & Editing by themselves also.
At present this Book is published as a Net-Publication with the help of the  organization of America. In future we may publish it as a Book also. We are also planning to put more Aagams in English before you.
We also invite learned persons to translate more & more 'authentic Jain literature in English for kids and youths, so the ignorant people of regional languages can also read or learn our "Shashtra & Granth".
We are very much thankful to Shree Pravinbhai, Sudeshbhai, Sangeetaben, Late Mr. Krupal Shah and all other known-unknown persons who helped us for this project directly or indirectly.
