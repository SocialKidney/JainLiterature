आचार्य समन्तभद्र द्वारा रचित रत्नकरण्डकश्रावकाचार एक अत्यन्त महत्त्वपूर्ण ग्रन्थ है। इसकी अनेकानेक विशेषताएँ हैं।
सल्लेखना या समाधिमरण का वैज्ञानिक विवेचन भी इस ग्रन्थ की एक महत्त्वपूर्ण विशेषता है। इस ग्रन्थ में सल्लेखना पर एक स्वतंत्र अधिकार ही लिखा गया है, जिसमें सल्लेखना के स्वरूप, विधि एवं महत्त्व पर विशद प्रकाश डाला गया है। इस अधिकार का हमें विशेष रूप से पहला श्लोक बड़ी ही सावधानी से समझना चाहिए। इसमें स्पष्ट लिखा है कि गणधर देवों ने सल्लेखना धारण करने का उचित समय तब कहा है जब उपसर्ग, दुर्भिक्ष, जरा, रोग आदि किसी भी कारण से कोई निष्प्रतिकार ऐसी स्थिति उत्पन्न हो जाए जिसका प्रतिकार, उपचार व्यवस्था न हो सके और मृत्यु अवश्यंभावी बन गई हो।
इसका अभिप्राय है कि जब तक मृत्यु अवश्यंभावी न हो, आए हुए संकट का प्रतिकार (निवारण) संभव हो, तब तक यम सल्लेखना नहीं लेनी चाहिए। शरीर भी इसका संकेत देता रहता है। यदि शरीर अभी एक चम्मच भी पानी ग्रहण कर रहा हो तो समस्त अन्न-जल का त्याग करने वाली यम सल्लेखना नहीं लेनी चाहिए। नियम सल्लेखना लेकर आत्मा-परमात्मा का ध्यान अवश्य करते रहना चाहिए। यम सल्लेखना के लिए इस प्रकार की नियम सल्लेखना का अभ्यास बहुत उपयोगी होता है।

PREFACE
The Glory of Acũrya Samantabhadra
Ācārya Samantabhadra was a great Digambara ascetic endowed A with exceptional knowledge of the Jaina doctrine. He preached and propagated, far and wide, core principles of the doctrine by visiting many places in India. His literary and philosophical talents are not open to dispute; many inscriptions and works by subsequent Jaina Acāryas have extolled his virtues as well as his works in superlative terms. A case in point is the assertion by Ācārya Jinasena in Adipurāṇal:
नमः समन्तभद्राय महते कविवेधसे । 4&104 FAYHT: 040184: 1143 11
I bow to Ācārya Samantrabhadra, the ultimate creator (Brahmā) among all poets, whose words are like a stroke of lightning which tears apart mountains of misconceptions. कवीनां गमकानां च वादिनां वाग्मिनामपि । 421: 414-7745TL HET ESTHvíld 11 44 11
Acārya Samantrabhadra's glory reigned supreme among all poets, scholars, disputants, and preachers; he was like a jewel on their heads.
Four exceptional qualities of Ācārya Samantabhadra have been mentioned: 1) poetic skill (kavitva) which made his compositions excellent in terms of profoundness of content and grandiosity of expression; 2) intellectual authority (gamakatva) because of which he was able to explore and expound deep meanings of profound religious texts; 3) debating skill (vāditva) which made him capable of reasoning out the most difficult philosophical disputes; and 4) charming

Preface
eloquence (vāgmitva) that engendered admiration for his truthfulness and straightforwardness even in the minds of his adversaries.
Ācārya Narendrasena in Siddhāntasārasamgraha2, a widely read Sanskrit text dealing with the seven substances (tattvas), avers that only the most fortunate human beings get access to the words of Acũrya Samantabhadra:
श्रीमत्समन्तभद्रस्य देवस्यापि वचोऽनघम् । YIfUHI Gaf4 26-11 are aer yat: 11 11 11 Just as the attainment of human birth is difficult, it is extremely rare to get access to the incontrovertible words of the Most Learned Ācārya Samantrabhadra. सुदुर्लभमपि प्राप्तं तत्कर्मप्रशमादिह । 7 THAT HTETET E 67 à RT: 11 12 11 Only when the inauspicious (aśubha) karmas of a man get to quiescence is he able to come face-to-face with the holy words of Acārya Samantrabhadra. Those who fail to adopt the path of piety even after exposure to his words can only be said to have been overwhelmed by delusion.
Ācārya Samantabhadra has not only been termed a brilliant grammarian, logician and philosopher, he has been recognized as an unmatched disputant, and a great preacher of the Jaina doctrine. Ācārya Subhacandra in Jñānārņavaḥ3 has likened the poetic compositions of Svāmi Samantabhadra to the bright rays of the sun.
Ācārya Jinasena, author of Harivansapurāņa4, has likened the expositions of Ācārya Samantabhadra to the words of Lord Mahāvīra:
जीवसिद्धिविधायीह कृतयुक्त्यनुशासनम् । 29: 44746 pag airpla facand 11 29 11 The words of Ācārya Samantabhadra, the composer of Jīvasiddhi

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
(discourse on the path to liberation) and Yuktyanusāsana (discourse on the merits and demerits of different standpoints), carry the same glory as the words of Lord Mahāvīra.
It is mentioned in Jaina literature5 that Acārya Samantabhadra once introduced himself to the king of Vārāṇasī as:
(x)
आचार्योऽहं कविरहमहं वादिराट् पण्डितोऽहम्,
दैवज्ञोऽहं भिषगहमहं मान्त्रिकस्तान्त्रिकोऽहम् ।
राजन्नस्यां जलधिवलयामेखलायामिलाया
माज्ञासिद्धः किमिति बहुना सिद्धसारस्वतोऽहम् ।।
O king! I am a preceptor (ācārya), a poet (kavi), foremost among the interpreters of the sacred scriptures (vādī), a scholar (pandita), an astrologer (jyotiṣi), a practitioner of medicine (vaidya), a reciter of spells (mantrika), and skilled in mystical incantations (tantrika). Do I need say more? My utterances become inviolable commands (ājñāsiddha), and I have subjugated the goddess of learning Sarasvati (sārasvatasiddha).
The personality of Acarya Samantabhadra was a rare combination of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of Jainism pristine faith, knowledge, and conduct - that are empirically considered essential to the attainment of liberation. He was one of the most impelling proponents of the Jaina doctrine of anekantavada - a philosophical system which maintains that reality has multifarious aspects and that a complete apprehension of it must necessarily take into account all these aspects. Non-appreciation of this doctrine has caused the other philosophical systems fall into the trap of one-sided, incomplete, and unsustainable dogmas that fail to explain the Truth. The words of Acarya Samantabhadra are incontrovertible as these are guarded by the Jaina doctrine of conditional predications (syadvāda) - a system of scientific safeguards that aims at maintaining proper consistency in metaphysical thought.

Preface
Several Jaina holy texts6 have mentioned that Ācārya Samantabhadra was destined to attain the highest and supreme status of a Tīrthankara (a ford-maker for the others to cross the ocean of worldly cycle of births and deaths - samsāra). As a Tīrthankara he will propagate Truth for the welfare of all living beings and will be worshipped by the lords of the devas and the men during the five most auspicious events (pañca kalyāņaka)* that must take place in the life of a Tīrthařkara.
HIS TIME
The time when Ācārya Samantabhadra flourished cannot be ascertained with great precision. Jugalkishore Mukhtar, after due research and detailed analysis as presented in his Preface to Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra7, has arrived at the conclusion that Ācārya Samantabhadra must have lived after Acārya Kundakunda and Ācārya Umāsvāmi but before Ācārya Pūjyapāda. Broadly, he has fixed Ācārya Samantabhadra's time as the second or the third century, Vikram Samvata (VS). As Gregorian Year 2000 CE corresponds to Year 2057 in the VS calendar, Ācārya Samantabhadra's time can be fixed around the second century CE.
HIS WORKS Ācārya Samantabhadra is known to have authored the following profound treatises:
rīmāṁsā or Devāgamastotra Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra Svayambhūstotra Yuktyanuśāsana Stutividyā or Jinaśataka or Jinastutiśataka or Jinaśatakālaňkāra Jivasiddhi Gandhahastimahābhāsya

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
Uncertainty prevails about the existence of the last two treatises.
Āptamīmāmsā, known also as Devagama or Devāgamastotra, is a treatise of 114 verses which discusses in a philosophical-cum-logical manner the Jaina view of Reality, starting with the concept of omniscience and the attributes of the Omniscient. Devotion to a deity without proper assessment and understanding of its praiseworthiness leads to naught in terms of utility. Blind faith based on traditional values and without the use of own power of discrimination leads to superstitions. Superstitions arise from ignorance and keep the worshipper overwhelmed with expectations and fear, just the opposite of the very purpose of adoration. Adoration is laudable only if it renders tranquility and equanimity to the mind of the worshipper. In the opening verse of Aptamimamsa, Acārya Samantabhadra questions the validity of the attributes that are traditionally associated with a praiseworthy deity and goes on to establish, in Verse 6, the logic of accepting the Omniscient as the most trustworthy and praiseworthy Supreme Being:
You only are such an Omniscient, free from all defects, because your words are not in contradiction with either the reason or the scripture. The proof of non-contradiction of your words lies in the fact that your tenets (about liberation etc.) are unopposed to what has been established through the known sources of knowledge.
After having established that it was certainly possible to attain omniscience, and employing the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda), Acārya Samantabhadra faults certain prevailing conceptions that were based on absolutism: existence (bhāvaikānta) and non-existence (abhävaikānta), non-dualism (advaita-ekānta) and separateness (pṛthaktva-ekānta), and permanence (nityatva-ekānta) and momentariness (kṣanika-ekānta). He asserts that the entity (dharmi) and its attribute (dharma) are neither absolutely dependent (āpekṣika) nor absolutely independent (anapekṣika). Only an entity which has general (sāmānya - concerning the substance, dravya) and

Preface
particular (vićeşa - concerning the mode, paryāya) attributes can be the subject of knowledge. Substance without its modification and modification without its substance cannot be the subject of valid knowledge; only their combination can be the subject of knowledge. He goes on to clarify certain other burning issues and misconceptions. He asserts that both fate and human-effort are jointly responsible for desirable and undesirable effects. The desirable and undesirable effects that one begets without premeditation should be understood due primarily to one's fate (daiva). The desirable and undesirable effects that one begets in consequence of premeditation should be understood due primarily to one's human-effort (pauruşa). Further, he asserts that our auspicious (viếudhi) or inauspicious (saīklesa) kinds of dispositions cause the influx of meritorious (punya) or demeritorious (pāpa) karmas. We are told that bondage (bandha) is caused due to ignorance (ajñāna) accompanied by delusion (moha), and bondage is not caused due to ignorance (ajñāna) not accompanied by delusion (moha). Highlighting the indispensability of syāduāda, it is asserted that syādvāda, the doctrine of conditional predications, and kevalajñāna, omniscience, are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while kevalajñāna illumines directly, syādvāda illumines indirectly.
Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra, comprising 150 verses, is a celebrated and perhaps the earliest Digambara work dealing with the excellent path of dharma that every householder (śrāvaka) must follow. All his efforts should be directed towards the acquisition and safekeeping of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya), comprising right faith (samyagdarśana), right knowledge (samyagjñāna) and right conduct (samyakcăritra), which lead to releasing him from worldly sufferings and establishing him in the state of supreme happiness. The treatise expounds an easy-to-understand meaning of ‘right faith': To have belief, as per the Reality, in the sect-founder or deity (āpta or deva), the scripture (āgama or sāstra), and the preceptor (tapobhrt or guru). It specifies criteria to distinguish between the real and the counterfeit

enabling one to eliminate follies attributable to wrong faith. Only the householder who has right faith is established on the path to liberation. On the way, he obtains many ineffable boons; he is not reborn as an infernal being, as a plant or an animal, in neuter and feminine genders, in low caste, as a cripple, with a short lifetime, and in a state of poverty. He is reborn as a heavenly being (deva) endowed with extraordinary splendour and a lifespan of millions of millenniums, or as a human being endowed with vigour, lustre, learning, strength, glory and renown, growth and advancement, success, grandeur, high caste, and the ability to put in best of effort. In short, right faith is the treasure chest of whatever is propitious and worthy; wrong faith of whatever is inauspicious and contemptible. After laying the foundation called the right faith, Ācārya Samantabhadra goes on to complete the superstructure known as the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) with the remaining two elements, right knowledge and right conduct. The householder who has attained right faith on the destruction of darkness of delusion is fit to attain right knowledge and right conduct. He gets rid of the conduits of demerit (pāpa) comprising injury (hiņsā), falsehood (anyta), stealing (steya), unchastity (abrahma), and attachment to possessions (parigraha). Further, he observes three subsidiary vows (gunavrata), and four instructional vows (śikṣāvrata). Giving up of the body in a manner that upholds righteousness (dharma) on the occurrence of a calamity, famine, senescence, or disease, from which there is no escape, is called the vow of sallekhanā. Sallekhanā has been termed as the final fruit or culmination of penance (religious austerity) and, therefore, all persons with right faith, the ascetic as well as the householder, look forward to attaining voluntary, passionless death at the appropriate time. The treatise finally describes the eleven stages (pratimā) of the householder's conduct.
Svayambhūstotra is a fine composition, in Sanskrit, dedicated to the adoration of the Twenty-four Tīrthankara, the Most Worshipful Supreme Beings. Through its 143 verses Svayambhūstotra not only

Preface
enriches reader's devotion, knowledge, and conduct but also frees his mind from blind faith and superstition. Svayambhūstotra takes the reader's mind to a higher plane. It proclaims that the adoration of the Tīrthankara is neither for receiving boons nor for getting rid of unpropitious happenings. By making zealous obeisance, and by recapitulating and recounting the supreme qualities, including infinite knowledge and divine splendour, of the Tīrthankara, the worshipper only wishes to clear up his soul of the karmic mire, developing thereby the power to someday tread the path shown by Him. Established firmly in the right faith and rid of ignorance, he experiences ineffable tranquility and equanimity.
Yuktyanusāsana, comprising 64 verses, evaluates in a logical manner the beliefs that lead to the attainment of the state of Supreme Bliss as against those that lead to the continuous wandering in the three worlds.
Stutividyā (Jinaśataka), as the name suggests, is the adoration of the Supreme Beings (Tīrthankara). Acārya Samantabhadra has skillfully used highly ornamental language in this work; for instance, the first half of the line of a verse becomes its second half by using the same letters in reverse order*. Notwithstanding the floridity of language, each of the 116 verses of the treatise carries profound meaning; when assimilated properly it leads to the destruction of inimical karmas.
THE STORY OF HIS DISEASE There is a story that finds mention in several Jaina texts about the

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
hardship that Ācārya Samantabhadra had to endure while he was an ascetic. Although there are variations in some elements of the story, the essential gist is as follows:
Svāmi Samantabhadra, in his early stage of asceticism, was attacked with a disease known as bhasmaka which refers, in Ayurveda, to the condition of insatiable hunger or appetite. The stomach has digestive power or "fire” (jațharāgni) that drives all digestion and when it becomes very strong, food digests very quickly and produces hunger and desire for more food. As food gets digested very quickly, the throat remains dry and a burning sensation prevails. According to Ayurveda, air (vāta), bile (pitta) and phlegm (kapha) are essential elements in human body and a distortion in their balance gives rise to health problems. When kapha becomes weak and vāta and pitta become strong, any food eaten gets reduced to ashes (bhasma) in no time. The complications include jaundice, anemia, yellow skin, diarrhoea, urine anomalies, colic, unconsciousness, hemorrhage, hyperacidity and burning pain. The body progressively gets emaciated and weak. The only way to cure the disease is to eat rich and stodgy food in profuse quantity.
It is impossible for a Jaina (Digambara) saint to eat more than once a day or in excess of his customary intake which is less than the fill. Not deviating in the least from such restrictions, Svāmi Samantabhadra tried to endure the affliction through strong resolve. Finding the disease intractable, he ultimately thought of embracing passionless death by resorting to the vow of sallekhanā, as allowed in Jainism. Svāmi Samantabhadra approached his Preceptor to get his approval for the proposed vow of sallekhanā. The Preceptor, an accomplished visionary, foresaw that Svāmi Samantabhadra had many more years still left in his life, and that he was destined to be a great exponent of Jainism. He, therefore, forbade Svāmi Samantabhadra from undertaking the vow of sallekhanā and asked him to free himself from the symbols and restrictions of Jaina sainthood till the time his disease got cured.

Preface
Svāmi Samantabhadra made obeisance to his Preceptor and, with a heavy heart, took leave of him. Discarding nakedness and smearing his body with ash, he adopted the exterior of a Hindu saint. He started taking food that would cure him of his disease. He reached the town of Kāńcī, ruled by Sivakoti, a staunch follower of Lord Siva. Śivakoți had built a Siva temple in Kāncī where large amount of food was being offered daily to the deity (Sivalinga). Saint Samantabhadra told the king that he had the power to make the deity consume food being offered. The king accepted the offer. Closing the doors of the temple, Saint Samantabhadra ate the heap of food offering. When the doors were opened, everyone was highly impressed with the so-called divine feat of the saint. This continued for a few days.
As the disease of Saint Samantabhadra got mitigated with the passage of time, he was no longer able to eat all food being offered to Lord Siva. The king became suspicious of the purported divine power of the saint and ordered his actions to be watched, keeping the doors of the temple open. Saint Samantabhadra grasped the gravity of the situation and took it as an external calamity (upasagra) befalling him. Vowing not to take any food until the end of the calamity and discarding all attachment to his body, he started the adoration of the Twenty-four Tīrthankara.
As Saint Samantabhadra reached the adoration of the eighth Tīrthankara, Lord Candraprabha, and as he gazed at the idol of the reigning deity (Sivalinga), due to some divine intervention, it burst, revealing a beautiful and magnificent image of Lord Candraprabha, to the wonder and astonishment of all present. Saint Samantabhadra finished the adoration of the remaining sixteen Tirthankara. This miracle led King Sivakoți and his younger brother Sivāyana fall at his
After completing the adoration of the Twenty-four Tirthankara, Saint Samantabhadra gave his blessings to the two brothers. This story portrays the environment in which the composition of t] sacred text Svayambhūstotra took place.

himself into the order of holy Jaina asceticism. King Sivakoți and his brother Sivāyana, highly impressed with the Jaina doctrine and the power of true adoration, left their worldly pursuits and became Ācārya Samantabhadra's disciples.
I make obeisance humble at the worshipful feet of Ācārya Samantabhadra who had unmatched intellect to discern the right from the wrong and illumined, through profound compositions, the right path that leads to Supreme Bliss.
Ācārya Vidyananda - Established Firmly in Own Nature
Fifty-three years ago, in 1963, Ācārya Vidyānanda (b. 1925) took to the arduous path of Digambara asceticism (muni). “I do not belong to others nor do others belong to me; there is nothing that is mine here." Thus determined and conquering his senses he took to the excellent form in which he was born (renouncing all clothes, naked). A featherwhisk (picchi) - the implement of compassion, a water-pot (kamandalu) - the implement of purity, and the Scripture (śāstra) – the implement of knowledge, became his only material companions. His pious figure, turned golden by the fire of austerities (tapas) and rid of all encumbrances, external and internal, personifies and propagates the teachings of Lord Jina.
Attachment and aversion are the soul's own psychical modes brought about by nescience, which, in turn, is due to the soul's association with the karmic matter. Psychical modes are the sole province of the soul and are not present in any physical matter. Karmic bondage causes dispositions like attachment, and such dispositions cause karmic bondage. Knowing the true nature of the soul and the karmic matter, Acārya Vidyānanda is engaged constantly in the practice of ridding his soul from the bondage of karmic shackles. He reckons that the soul is pure consciousness and all other dispositions

Preface
are alien to it; only the various forms of karmas have kept it confined to and whirling in the mire of the world. As all karmas associated with the soul are annihilated, there is no cause for it to wander further in worldly existence. Due to our wrong beliefs, we give undue and misplaced importance to our so-called possessions, animate and inanimate, of the present life. These possessions include our body, relations like husband or wife, sons, daughters, friends and peers, and things that we acquire with great effort, like land, business and wealth. Due to ignorance and consequent delusion, we engender in our souls emotions of attachment and aversion. Attachment causes us to seek association of desirable objects, and aversion dissociation of undesirable ones. When desirable objects such as the son, the wife or the wealth are lost, we are grieved. Contact of undesirable objects such as foul or hostile environment causes us pain. On deprivation of desirable objects, we think repeatedly of regaining them and on association of undesirable objects of getting rid of them. When there is pain caused by disease such as gout and rheumatism, we think continually about the means to subdue it, and be cured. Engrossing oneself in pleasures not attained is another kind of sorrowful thought activity. We also spoil our tranquility by causing injury to others, speaking lies, stealing, and thoughts of safeguarding of wealth and other possessions. All the above-mentioned thought-activities are evil or inauspicious, cause sorrow, and extend transmigration.
Turning his soul inwards and avoiding all outward concerns, Ācārya Vidyānanda has established himself firmly in own nature. Engaged incessantly in Self-realization, he has no time or inclination to interact with the external environment. External objects generally remain unnoticed by him, as he pays no attention to these. His interaction with the people is minimal and without passions. For the few people he has to interact with occasionally, he engenders no lasting emotions of attachment or aversion.
A Yogi of few words, he chooses words that are sweet, positive and helpful. As soon as his interaction with the outside world is over, he

presents himself again to the service of the pure Self. I repeatedly salute Acārya Vidyānanda, the light to guide me on the path that leads to true happiness, here and hereafter, by prostrating in front of him with great devotion. I meditate on his virtues in order to wash away from my soul impurities like attachment, aversion and delusion, and to reach the stage of spiritual excellence.

मंगलाचरण नमः श्रीवर्द्धमानाय निर्धूतकलिलात्मने । सालोकानां त्रिलोकानां यद्विद्या दर्पणायते ॥ १ ॥
सामान्यार्थ - जिनकी आत्मा ने कर्मरूप कलंक को नष्ट कर दिया है अर्थात् जो वीतराग हैं अथवा जिनकी आत्मा ने हितोपदेश द्वारा अन्य जीवों को कर्मरूप कलंक से रहित किया है अर्थात् जो हितोपदेशी हैं और जिनका केवलज्ञान अलोक सहित तीनों लोकों के विषय में दर्पण के समान आचरण करता है अर्थात् जो सर्वज्ञ हैं, उन अन्तिम तीर्थंकर श्री वर्द्धमानस्वामी को अथवा अनन्तचतुष्टयरूप लक्ष्मी से वृद्धि को प्राप्त चौबीस तीर्थंकरों को मैं नमस्कार करता हूँ।
INVOCATION
I bow to Lord Vardhamāna who has rid his soul of all karmic dirt and whose teachings reflect, as it were in a mirror, the three worlds (universe) and the beyond (non-universe). The word 'Srīvardhamāna’in the verse is also interpreted as the noble souls of the twenty-four Tīrthankara who have attained the supreme status marked by the treasure of four infinitudes (ananta catustaya). Thereafter, through their divine discourses, have caused the removal of karmic dirt from other souls.

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Lord Vardhamana, the World Teacher
Lord Vardhamana (known also as Lord Vira or Lord Mahāvīra) is the last of the twenty-four Tirthankara. A Tirthankara (a fordmaker for the others to cross the ocean of worldly cycle of births and deaths - samsara) propagates Truth for the welfare of all living beings. In every half cycle of cosmic age, the aeon of regeneration (utsarpiņi) or of degeneration (avasarpiņi), twenty-four Tirthankara are born in this part of the universe (called the Bharata kṣetra of Jambūdvīpa). Lord Vardhamāna graced this earth more than two and a half millenniums ago. He had the grandeur of right knowledge as his eyes and had cast the divine light of his discourses to destroy the darkness of ignorance, just as the rays of the moon destroy the darkness of the night.
The self-enlightened (svayambhū) saviour of all living beings, destroys the four inimical varieties of karmas (ghatiyā karmas) - deluding (mohaniya), knowledge-obscuring (jñānāvarṇīya), perception-obscuring (darśanavarṇīya), and obstructive (antaraya) through pure concentration and attains the allembracing, supreme and standalone knowledge known as omniscience (kevalajñāna). As the soul attains omniscience, the other four kinds of knowledge - sensory knowledge (matijñāna), scriptural knowledge (śrutajñāna), clairvoyance (avadhijñāna), and telepathy (manaḥparyayajñāna) – which know the object of knowledge partially and in succession become redundant and their role vanishes. Lord Vardhamana, thus became the 'World Teacher' or 'Arhat' or 'Apta' or 'Jina' - the true guide to put us on the right path and worthy to be venerated and worshipped by the lords of the world.
-
A Tirthankara is worshipped by the lords of the devas and the men during the five most auspicious events (pañca kalyāṇaka) that

Verse 1
must take place in His life: 1. garbha kalyāņaka: when the soul of the Tīrthankara
enters the Mother's womb. 2. janma kalyāṇaka: on the birth of the Tīrthankara. 3. dīkņā kalyāṇaka (or tapa-kalyāņaka): when the
Tīrthařkara renounces all worldly possessions and
becomes an ascetic. 4. jñāna kalyāņaka: when the Tīrthankara attains
omniscience (kevalajñāna). 5. mokşa-kalyāņaka (or nirvāṇa-kalyāņaka): when the
Tīrthankara finally attains liberation (mokṣa or nirvāņa)
and becomes a Siddha. The auspicious body (paramaudārika śarīra) of the World Teacher or Lord Jina acquires most splendid attributes, free from eighteen imperfections. He is possessed of forty-six distinctive and divine attributes. Peace and plenty must prevail wherever He goes. Naturally hostile animals become friends in His presence, and flowers and fruits bloom out of season. The divine attributes and splendours of the Arhat are described thus in the Scripture:
The Arhat is free from these eighteen imperfections: 1. janma-(re)birth; 2. żarā -old-age; 3. trşā – thirst; 4. kşudhā – hunger; 5. vismaya - astonishment; 6. arati – displeasure; 7. kheda – regret; 8. roga-sickness;
9. visāda or śoka - grief; 10. mada – pride;

11. moha- delusion; 12. bhaya - fear; 13. nidrā – sleep; 14. cintā – anxiety; 15. sveda - perspiration; 16. rāga-attachment; 17. dveșa – aversion; and 18. maraņa - death.
Forty-six divine attributes of the Arhat comprise four infinitudes (ananta catusțaya), thirty-four miraculous happenings (atiśaya), and eight splendours (prātihārya).
The four infinitudes (ananta catuṣtaya) are: 1. ananta jñāna - infinite knowledge; 2. ananta darśana – infinite perception; 3. ananta sukha-infinite bliss; and 4. ananta vīrya – infinite energy.
Of the thirty-four miraculous happenings (atiśaya), ten appear naturally at the time of birth, ten on attainment of infinite knowledge (kevalajñāna), and the remaining fourteen are fashioned by the celestial devas.
The eight splendours (prātihārya) are: 1. aśoka vặkșa – the Ashoka tree; 2. simhāsana - bejeweled throne; 3. chatra – three-tier canopy; 4. bhāmaņdala – halo of unmatched luminance; 5. divya dhvani – divine voice of the Lord without lip
movement; 6. puspa-varşā – shower of fragrant flowers; 7. cāmara - waving of sixty-four majestic flywhisks; and

Verse 1
8. dundubhi – dulcet sound of kettle-drums and other
musical instruments. For the Lord's divine discourse the devas erect a heavenly Pavilion (samavasaraña) befitting His glory, and there the World Teacher sits, facing the East, a few inches above the huge golden lotus placed on a throne of heavenly gems. The Lord appears to be looking in all the four directions. His voice is without the movements of the glottis or lips, and is, therefore, termed anakşarī (without letters). The Lord's divine voice, as a result of one of the eight splendours (prātihārya), is heard and enjoyed by all present in their respective tongue (ardhamāgadhī bhāṣā). The World Teacher is the sun that blossoms the soul-lotus of the worldly beings. His divine discourse is the rain of nectar-water that washes away the dirt of ignorance from all souls. He is the wish-fulfilling tree (kalpavíkşa) for all those aspiring for liberation.
When the life-determining (āyuḥ) karma of the World Teacher is within one muhūrta (48 minutes), He embraces the highest order of pure concentration and annihilates the four non-destructive (aghātiyā) karmas – feeling producing (vedanīya), life-determining (āyuḥ), name-determining (nāma), and status-determining (gotra) - achieving the ultimate goal that a soul may aspire to reach, i.e., liberation (nirvāna)*. Liberation signifies that there is nothing left to strive for or look forward to. His soul is purged of all karmic impurities and becomes pristine like pure gold, free from dirt and alloys. He crosses the worldly ocean of transmigration. His soul darts up to the summit of the universe to remain there for eternity as a Siddha'with eight supreme qualities: 1. kṣāyika-samyaktva - infinite faith or belief in the tattvas
or essential principles of Reality. It is manifested on the

destruction of the faith-deluding (darśana mohanīya)
karma. 2. kevalajñāna – infinite knowledge, manifested on the
destruction of the knowledge-obscuring (jñānāvarṇīya) karma. kevaladarśana – infinite perception, manifested on the destruction of the perception-obscuring (darśanāvarṇīya)
karma. 4. anantavīrya – literally, infinite power; it is the absence of
fatigue in having knowledge of infinite substances. It is manifested on the destruction of the obstructive
(antarāya) karma. 5. sūkṣmatva – literally, fineness; it means that the liberated
soul is beyond sense-perception and its knowledge of the substances is direct, without the use of the senses and the mind. It is manifested on the destruction of the life
determining (āyuḥ) karma. 6. avagāhan - inter-penetrability; it means that the
liberated jīva does not hinder the existence of other such jīvas in the same space. It is manifested on the
destruction of the name-determining (nāma) karma. 7. agurulaghutva - literally, neither heavy nor light. Due to
this quality of agurulaghutva, the jīva continues to manifest through its form, complete and perfect. This supreme quality is manifested on the destruction of the status-determining (gotra) karma. avyābādha - it is undisturbed, infinite bliss, manifested on the destruction of the feeling-producing (vedanīya) karma.
The universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka) Space (ākāśa) is a non-soul substance (dravya) which is infinite,

eternal and without form (non-material, colourless, arūpī), and without activity (niṣkriya). It is one self-subsisting, indivisible whole; it is without parts and, as such, one single continuum. By negation of form or colour, the accompanying attributes of taste, smell and touch also are denied. Its function is to find room for all things.
Space has infinite space-points and it pervades both the universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka). Now what is universe? The space wherein the substances such as the medium of motion (dharma) and the medium of rest (adharma) exist is called the universe-space (lokākāśa). The three worlds and the Siddha silă are part of the universe*:
The Lower World: It comprises seven earths (having abodes of infernal beings), one below the other.
The Middle (Transverse) World: It comprises innumerable concentric islands-continents, extending one beyond the other in transverse position up to the ocean of Svayambhūramaṇa. Humans reside in the two and a half continents commencing from Jambudvipa up to the Manuṣottara mountain chain which runs in the middle of Puskaradvīpa, and in the two oceans Lavanoda and Kaloda.
The Upper World: Mount Meru of Jambudvipa is embedded in the earth to a depth of 1000 yojana and is 99,000 yojana high. Below it is the Lower World. That which extends transversely within this range (namely the height of Mount Meru) is the Middle World. Above it is the Upper World. There are sixteen heavens or kalpa, on eight storeys, which are the habitations of devas from Saudharma

to Acyuta. Above these are the higher celestial regions - vimānas of Graiveyaka, Anudiśa, and Anuttara. Above these is the holy Siddha silā, which is the abode of the Pure Souls dissociated forever from corporeal body and, having reached the topmost part of the universe, remain there in eternal bliss. The following description of the Siddha sila is given in the Scripture*:
At the top of the three worlds, is the eighth earth called Īşatprāgbhāra, which is one rajju wide, seven rajju long, and eight yojana high. In the middle of this earth is the Siddha kşetra (Siddha silā) in the form of a canopy (chatra), white like silver and with diameter equal to that of the human region*. It is eight yojana thick in the middle and decreases towards the margins like that of a bowl kept upright. In the upper layer of rarefied air (tanuvātavalaya) of this Siddha kşetra reside the liberated Pure Souls, Siddhas, endowed with eight supreme qualities. The whole of the region below this abode of the Pure Souls is the region of transmigration, known as samsāra, which is to be crossed with the aid of the Supreme Teacher.
Beyond the universe-space (lokākāśa) is the infinite nonuniverse space (alokākāśa) - see Fig. 1 on the next page.

देशयामि समीचीनं धर्मं कर्मनिबर्हणम् । संसारदुःखतः सत्त्वान् यो धरत्युत्तमे सुखे ॥२॥
सामान्यार्थ - मैं कर्मों का विनाश करने वाले उस समीचीन (श्रेष्ठ) धर्म को कहता हूँ जो जीवों को संसार के दु:खों से निकालकर स्वर्ग-मोक्ष आदि के उत्तम सुख में स्थित करता है - पहुँचा देता है।
I shall preach the karma-destroying, excellent course of conduct (dharma) that releases the living beings from worldly sufferings and establishes them in the state of supreme happiness.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The universe is eternal without beginning and end. In this universe the living beings have been enduring misery, in the beginningless cycle of births and deaths. Life is as uncertain as the bubbles that float on water. And riches which beget worldly happiness are evanescent like the clouds and the lightning. The body too is transitory by nature, full of suffering and pain, worthless and unclean.
The objects of pleasure of the senses too are transient like the bubbles. Money has failed to procure happiness whenever it has been put to test. There are many millions of people of money who are unhappy. Can it be status, family, children, fame and the like which are known to have afforded pleasure in the past? Surely not, for what they provide us with is ephemeral and adulterated with suffering as their parting is certain. It can be shown with respect to every worldly object that it cannot be happiness itself. There is no way of escape for the person caught in the meshes of birth, old age, death, disease and sorrow. The wealth acquired with great effort

Verse 2
does not accompany the self to the next birth. The friends who have shared the joys and sorrows of an individual cannot save him at his death. No one, relations or others, can take away an individual's manifold sufferings such as disease, old age and death. Happiness cannot be found in any object that we zealously seek.
The highest aspiration of man can only be to attain Divinity for his soul which gives rise to unalloyed bliss and happiness, and freedom from pain and suffering. The man with such an aspiration does not identify himself with thoughts of worldly existence and endeavours to march on the path indicated by the Omniscient Lord.
Supreme happiness Ācārya Nemicandra's Trilokasāra depicts the extreme happiness appertaining to the lords of the men and the devas but holds it as insignificant as compared to the supreme happiness enjoyed by the Siddha parameşthi:
चक्किकुरुफणिसुरेंदेसहमिंदे जं सुहं तिकालभवं । तत्तो अणंतगुणिदं सिद्धाणं खणसुहं होदि ॥ ५६० ॥ The happiness appertaining to the king of kings (cakravarti), the resident of the regions of enjoyment (bhogabhūmi), the lord of the lower celestials, the lord of the heavenly kalpa, and the lord of the heavens beyond the kalpa, is successively infinitely more. The supreme happiness or bliss that appertains to the Siddha parameşthī, however, can only be described as: “Just one instant of bliss that the Siddha parameșthi enjoys is infinitely more than the combined happiness that all the above mentioned worldly jīvas enjoy during the course of their past, present and future lives.”
........................

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
The above statement, though made metaphorically, is sufficient to suggest that the supreme happiness of the Siddha parameșthi is indescribable; it is beyond the senses, selfdependent, and devoid of fluctuations or impediments whatsoever. The happiness of the worldly jīvas, on the other hand, is sense-perceived, dependent on outside objects, and characterized by unease or anxiety. As the tongue of the man suffering from acid reflux is not able to savour the most delectable food, similarly, the soul which is soiled with karmic dirt is not able to feel or depict the supreme, unbounded happiness that appertains to the liberated soul.
Jain, Vijay K. (2014), "Ācārya Pūjyapāda's Istopadeśa – The Golden Discourse”, p. 19.
Ācārya Samantabhadra asserts that he is now going to preach that karma-destroying holy Doctrine which illumines the path leading to liberation. He declares that several kinds of worldly prosperity and distinctions wait on the way to embrace the worthy explorer.

The expounder of the Doctrine, Lord Jina, has preached that the excellent path of dharma (that leads to liberation, the state of supreme happiness) consists in right faith (samyagdarśana), right knowledge (samyagjñāna) and right conduct (samyakcāritra). The opposite path - wrong faith, wrong knowledge and wrong conduct – leads to wandering in the world (samsāra).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
As liberation is beyond the experience of those who have not attained omniscience, only an Omniscient is able to explain the meaning of liberation and the path leading to it. On the strength of the Doctrine expounded by Lord Jina, learned preceptors (ācāryas) have explained through profound compositions that, empirically, right faith, right knowledge and right conduct, together, must be understood to constitute the path to liberation.

सामान्यार्थ – परमार्थभूत - वास्तविक अथवा सच्चे अर्थ में - आप्त (देव), आगम (शास्त्र) और तपोभृत् (गुरु) का तीन मूढ़ताओं से रहित, आठ अंगों से सहित और आठ प्रकार के मदों से रहित श्रद्धान करना सम्यग्दर्शन कहलाता है।
To have belief, as per the Reality, in the sect-founder or deity (apta or deva), the scripture (agama or sastra), and the preceptor (tapobhṛt or guru) is right faith. This right faith must be rid of three kinds of follies (mūḍhatā), endowed with eight limbs (aṣṭānga) of right faith, and free from eight kinds of pride (mada).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Acārya Umāsvāmi, in Tattvārthasūtra, has defined right faith as:
तत्त्वार्थश्रद्धानं सम्यग्दर्शनम् ॥ १-२ ॥
Belief in substances ascertained as these are is right faith.
Since 'Ratnakaraṇḍaka-śrāvakācāra' is written primarily for the householder, in the present verse Acārya Samantabhadra, while maintaining the gist of the above definition, provides the reader with a simpler and more functional definition of right faith.
He asserts that right faith entails belief in three essentials: 1) the sect-founder (apta), 2) the scripture (agama), and 3) the preceptor (guru). But as there are many sect-founders, scriptures and preceptors advocating doctrines that have mutual contradictions and, moreover, each claiming to be genuine, how should one discern between the real and the counterfeit?

answer is provided in verses 5 to 10.
Elaborating on the attributes of right faith, in verses 11 to 18 the Ācārya declares that it must be strengthened by eight limbs (astānga):
1) freedom from doubt (niḥśañkita), 2) freedom from worldly desire (niķkāñksita), 3) freedom from revulsion (nirvicikitsā), 4) freedom from superstitions (amūdhadysți), 5) charitable forbearance and concealment of defects in
others (upagūhana), 6) ensuring steadfastness of right faith and conduct so as not
to swerve from the path to liberation (sthitikaraṇa), 7) propagation of the true path (prabhāvanā), 8) joy and affection towards the right path and its followers
(vātsalya). In verses 22 to 24 the three kinds of follies (mūờhatā) that a householder with right faith must assiduously guard against are mentioned:
1) folly relating to worldly customs (lokamūdhatā), 2) folly relating to deities (devamūdhatā), 3) folly relating to preachers (gurumūdhatā).
The Ācārya also asserts that a person with right faith must be free from eight kinds of pride (mada) - verse 25:
1) pride of knowledge (jñāna mada), 2) pride of veneration (pūjā mada), 3) pride of lineage (kula mada), 4) pride of caste (jāti mada), 5) pride of strength (bala mada), 6) pride of accomplishments (rddhi mada), 7) pride of austerities (tapa mada), 8) pride of beauty (śarīra mada).

That alone is true scripture which is the word of the Omniscient (Apta), inviolable, not opposed to the two kinds of valid knowledge – direct (pratyakşa) and indirect (parokşa) – reveals the true nature of Reality, universally helpful to living beings, and potent enough to destroy all forms of falsehood.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Jain, Champat Rai provides the following explanation to this verse:
The achārya gives here the six principal characteristics of the Jaina Scripture. The word of the Tīrthankara is never in conflict with valid knowledge, however acquired; it is never couched in mystic or mythological language, but reveals the nature of things as these exist in nature. For this reason the Jaina Siddhānta has nothing in common with dogmatic theology or mysticism, and is a purely scientific system of rational thought, capable of raising the human soul from the lowest depths of sin and despair and of installing it in the coveted Supreme Seat. The next great characteristic given by the āchārya is the quality of being helpful to all living beings, without exception. Dayā (mercy) and ahimsā (non-injuring) being the fundamental tenets of the Holy Siddhānta, Jainism

Verse 9
can never be ranked with those other creeds whose teaching inculcates, directly or indirectly, the taking of life for sacrifice or food. Thus, at every stage of its activity, Jainism always tends to protect and advance the interests of all kinds of living beings.
The last great characteristic of the Holy Scripture is that it is by itself capable of destroying falsehood. This is only natural, for it is a peculiarity of the scientific method which, being commendable to the most exacting and critical intellect, cannot but destroy all forms of error, doubt and ignorance, the three constituents of falsehood. It will be seen that Jainism proceeds by describing the nature of existing substances, dealing fully, in so far as is necessary for the purposes of religion, with the
lities or attributes which arise from their interaction in the course of evolution. It has nothing in common with dogmatism - "thou shalt do this,” and “thou shalt not do that,” etc., - nor with mystic mythology which says one thing and means quite another.
Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnda-śrāvakāchāra (or The Householder's Dharma)”, p. 4-6.
Ācārya Kundakunda in Pravacanasāra states that the scriptures are the true sources of direct and indirect knowledge: जिणसत्थादो अढे पच्चक्खादीहिं बुज्झदो णियमा ।
carefa Halaget et frei Hufergoo II -ce II He who assimilates the reality of substances through the Jaina scriptures, which contain valid knowledge (pramāņa), direct and other, certainly exhausts the heap of delusion and, therefore, the scriptures should be studied regularly.

Jaina Doctrine lays great emphasis on the purity of the soul rather than of the body. A Jaina saint aspires for the purity of his soul at the expense of the purity of his body. It is better to have a pure soul in a naturally impure body than an impure soul in an impure body but embellished with ornaments and sprayed with

deodorants. The inherent impurity of the body has thus been explained in the Scripture:
Acarya Samantabhadra's Svayambhustotra:
अजङ्गमं जङ्गमनेययन्त्रं यथा तथा जीवधृतं शरीरम् ।
बीभत्सु पूर्ति क्षयि तापकं च स्नेहो वृथात्रेति हितं त्वमाख्यः ॥
(७-२-३२)
As an inanimate equipment (a vehicle, for example) requires an animate being (a man) for its operation, so does the body, that the soul adopts as its encasement, require the soul for its functioning. The body is repugnant, foul-smelling, perishable, and a source of anxiety and, therefore, it is futile to have attachment towards it. O Lord Suparśvanatha, this is your benign precept.
30
Jain, Vijay K. (2015), "Acarya Samantabhadra's Svayambhustotra", p. 45.
Acārya Pujyapāda puts this aspect of the Jaina Doctrine plainly and forcefully in Istopadeśa:
यज्जीवस्योपकाराय तद्देहस्यापकारकम् ।
यद्देहस्योपकाराय तज्जीवस्यापकारकम् ॥ १९ ॥
Actions that are intended for the enrichment of the soul discard the welfare of the body, and the actions intended for the welfare of the body undermine soul-enrichment.
The same has been explained further:
The soul and the body are two distinct entities; the soul is a spiritual substance with consciousness as its primary attribute and the body is an inanimate object comprising physical matter. All our actions in the direction of enriching the soul would, as a

corollary, undermine the well-being of the body. Fasting and meditation are helpful aids to purify the soul but ignore the immediate needs of the body. Renunciation and austerities help the soul by saving it from harmful desires but deprive the body of the objects of its guard and embellishment. An ascetic striving after emancipation endures, without regret or remorse, bodily hardships and afflictions. He unreservedly endures the torments of extreme hunger, parching thirst, biting cold, and oppressive heat of the sun. Afflictions caused by insect-bites, roaming bare-foot on thorny roads, sitting in a particular posture for a long time, lying down on uneven and hard ground, and even serious disease, do not swerve him from the path. He embraces blameless nakedness like that of the child and is always free from the excitement of passions and agitations of the senses. Engaged continually in cleansing the soul from the mire of karmic impurities, he has no desire left to take bath and cleanse his body.
-
Having learnt the truth about bondage and emancipation, the saint is indifferent to the pleasures of the senses. He has no thought or desire for the well-being of the body and does not adorn it. For him the body is just an aid for acquiring the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of merit – right faith, right knowledge and right conduct and safeguarding them. He accepts pure, properly prepared food only once in a day, that too less than his fill, in order to keep his body intact, just as lubrication is indispensable to the running of the wheel. Although his physical frame reduces to a mere assemblage of skin, bones, and arteries, it becomes auspicious, adorable and worshipful. Due to severe austerities, he may have even developed extraordinary powers of cure but being devoid of passions, attachment and aversion, he does not use these powers to cure himself. No wonder, with the passage of time, the purity of his soul increases

manifold as his karmic body is purged of many kinds of harmful karmic matter. Our gross body must undergo changes due to the substance of time (kāla). Gradual, imperceptible changes take place in it incessantly, every instant. If gradual, imperceptible changes do not take place there can be no perceptible change either. We do not develop wrinkles or grey hair all of a sudden. When we perceive major transformations or changes in our body, which truly are results of minute changes taking place every instant, we term these changes as due to ‘aging'. The substance of time, which itself is without activity, is the auxiliary cause of the minute changes taking place in all substances. Conventionally, however, we talk of time as the past, the present and the future, or years, days and hours. Changes, minute as well as perceptible, must take place in our body and this process cannot be subverted. The body must undergo transformations due to the substance of time. And on the completion of the age-karn the soul must depart from the body to its new abode. Our efforts to nourish the body at the expense of the soul, therefore, are short-sighted and are bound to result into suffering.
Jain, Vijay K. (2014), “Acārya Pūjyapāda's Istopadeśa – The Golden Discourse”, p. 58-60.
Jain, Champat Rai’s explanation of this verse is apt and forthright:
Non-Jainas generally express disgust at the sight of Jaina ascetics whose rules of conduct do not allow them to attend to the embellishment of their physical person. This verse points out the proper mental attitude for a true believer - he should respect the virtues of the saint, and love him for his self-control, but should not feel disgust with the impure or unclean state of his outward self, i.e., body. Conceived and developed in the filthiest part of the body of its female parent, full of urine,

Verse 13
faeces, saliva and many other similar impurities, how can the body, asks the āchārya, be regarded as clean? Let him who would laugh at the dirty condition of the body of the Jaina saint remember that, in its true nature, his own body is but a basket of stinking unsightly filth covered over with leathern parchment. There is yet an important distinction between his body and that of the saint which consists in the fact that, while his own carcass is filled, to the full, with the refuse resulting from unrestrained sense-indulgence, the saint's contains less filth, both quantitatively and qualitatively, owing to the control which he puts on his senses. The difference between their bodies is then reduced to this that the saint's is actually the purer of the two, though the other appears to be more attractive outwardly. And, so far as the purity of the soul is concerned, the man who scorns the saint is nowhere as compared with him whom he likes to scorn, since the very fact of ridiculing a true saint is an indication of gross ignorance and sin. The dirty, untidy appearance of a muni (ascetic) is a necessary step in the path of progress, and is unavoidable at a certain stage. As a matter of fact, the attainment of nirvāṇa is consistent only with a complete absorption in one's own ātman (soul), and necessitates the withdrawal of attention from the physical body and the outside world, so that the Jaina householder, who is expected to be a pattern of cleanliness, is enjoined to gradually train himself to neglect his fleshy 'prison', the body of matter, and to study the well-being of his soul. The ascetic, who has renounced the world and who wishes to reach the goal in the shortest space of time, naturally lays all the stress he can on spiritual meditation, and can ill afford to waste his time on studying such useless and progress-obstructing matters as the attractiveness of his person. Neither is he a loser in the long run, for the destruction of his ghātia karmas at once raises him

to the status of divinity, when those very beings who used to ridicule him fall down at his feet. It will be now evident that those who affect disgust at the sight of a Jaina monk are never likely to attain nirvāṇa, for neglect of the body is an absolutely unavoidable necessity for the pilgrim's progress, and he who has nothing but loathing and disgust for the kind of life which those who are striving to reach the goal lead can never be induced to set his foot on the Path. For the same reason those who object to the nude appearance of the Jaina saint also debar themselves from nirvāņa.

In these two verses Ācārya Samantabhadra has given the names of great personages whose stories, of unflinching adherence to the respective limbs of right faith, are worth recollecting. These stories find mention in various purāņas, constituent parts of rich Jaina literature.

यदि पापनिरोधोऽन्यसम्पदा किं प्रयोजनम् । अथ पापास्रवोऽस्त्यन्यसम्पदा किं प्रयोजनम् ॥ २७ ॥
सामान्यार्थ – यदि पाप को रोकने वाला रत्नत्रय-धर्म है तो अन्य सम्पत्ति से क्या प्रयोजन है; यदि पाप का आस्रव है तो अन्य सम्पत्ति से क्या प्रयोजन है?
What shall the man profit from the affluence of the world if he owns the wealth of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) that cause the stoppage of evil activity (pāpa); what shall the man profit from the affluence of the world if the influx (āsrava) of evil activity (pāpa) persists?
EXPLANATORY NOTE
To the man endowed with the treasure of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya), the riches of the world appear insignificant. The Three Jewels (ratnatraya) keep the bondage of evil karmas (pāpa) at bay and, therefore, what he has in store for future is nothing but bliss and happiness. On the other hand, the man owning the riches of the world but without the treasure of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya) is bound to amass evil karmas (pāpa) that must eventually land him into the most unfavourable and demanding conditions.

In some commentaries, garima - the ability to make one's body extremely heavy - is mentioned, in place of kāmarūpitva.
Acārya Pujyapāda asserts in Sarvärthasiddhi:
Persons with right faith, till they finally attain liberation, are destined to superior states of existence thereby getting reborn in auspicious environments only. It is said in the Scripture that persons with right faith will be reborn among the fourth order of devas - heavenly (vaimanika) devas - and not among the three lower orders, namely the residential (bhavanavāsī), the peripatetic (vyantara), and the stellar (jyotiska) devas. Those persons who are characterized by right belief and practice restraint with attachment, and restraint-cum-non-restraint, will also be reborn in the higher heavens of Saudharma kalpa and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings.

Section 2
Right Knowledge द्वितीय परिच्छेद
अन्यूनमनतिरिक्तं यथातथ्यं विना च विपरीतात् । निःसन्देहं वेद यदाहुस्तज्ज्ञानमागमिनः ॥ ४२ ॥
सामान्यार्थ - जो ज्ञान वस्तु के स्वरूप को न्यूनता रहित, अधिकता रहित, ज्यों-का-त्यों, विपरीतता रहित और सन्देह रहित जानता है उसे आगम के ज्ञाता पुरुष सम्यग्ज्ञान कहते हैं।
That by which the objects of knowledge are known without disregard of any of their present attributes (i.e., without denying the existence of an attribute that may not be under consideration at the moment), without over-emphasizing an attribute (i.e., without resorting to the absolutist point of view), as they are (i.e, as per the Reality), without contradiction (i.e., not against their true nature), and without doubt, is called by the knowers of the Scripture as right knowledge.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Belief in substances, souls and non-souls, as these actually are, is right faith. The Omniscient Lord has called right knowledge (samyagjñāna) as the effect and right faith (samyagdarśana) as the cause. Therefore, it is appropriate to venerate and acquire right

knowledge after the acquisition of right faith. Having acquired right faith, detailed cognition of substances, without fallacies of doubt (samsaya), perversity (vimoha or viparyaya), and indefiniteness (vibhrama or anadhyavasāya), is right knowledge.
Doubt (samsaya) means swaying of the mind without being able to assert the true nature of a thing. After acquiring the belief that bondage of virtuous karmas leads to birth in the heavens, entertaining skepticism about its validity is an instance of doubt. The cognition of an object as something which is contrary to its true nature is perversity (vimoha). For example, if we perceive nacre to be silver, we have knowledge vitiated by perversity. Indefiniteness (vibhrama) is vacillation about the real nature of a thing due to the shrouding of the intellect. For example, when we touch something while moving, we may be conscious that we have touched something but are unable to say, with any certainty, what it was, our knowledge is enshrouded in indefiniteness.
The attribute 'right' is intended to ward off uncertainty, doubt and error in knowledge. Right knowledge provides the foundation that is necessary for the conduct to be 'right'. Right faith needs to be reinforced by right knowledge derived from study, meditation and listening to the discourses of true saints.
Acārya Amitagati, in Yogasāra Prābhịta, has emphasized the importance of proper discrimination between the right and the wrong while acquiring knowledge:
ज्ञानस्य ज्ञानमज्ञानमज्ञानस्य प्रयच्छति । आराधना कृता यस्माद् विद्यमानं प्रदीयते ॥ ६-३४ ॥ Adoration of (right) knowledge results in the gain of (right) knowledge and adoration of wrong knowledge results in the gain of wrong knowledge, for only that can be given which one possesses.

Ācārya Nemicandra's Dravyasamgraha:
जीवादीसद्दहणं सम्मत्तं रूवमप्पणो तं तु । दुरभिणिवेसविमुक्कं णाणं सम्मं खु होदि सदि जम्हि ॥ ४१ ॥ Belief in substances, souls and non-souls, as these actually are, is right faith. Right faith is an inherent attribute of the soul. Having achieved right faith, knowledge of these substances, without fallacies of doubt (samśaya), error or perversity (uimoha or viparyaya), and uncertainty or indefiniteness (vibhrama oranadhyavasāya), is right knowledge.

Having attained right faith (samyagdarśana) as described above, for the advancement of the Self on spiritual path, one should exert oneself wholeheartedly for the acquisition of right knowledge (samyagjñāna) through proper understanding of the tenets of valid knowledge contained in the Scripture.
कर्तव्योऽध्यवसायः सदनेकान्तात्मकेषु तत्त्वेषु । संशयविपर्ययानध्यवसायविविक्तमात्मरूपं तत् ॥ ३५ ॥
The nature of reality (substances) must be ascertained with the help of the Jaina doctrine of manifold points of view (anekāntavāda) and the knowledge thus obtained, free from doubt, misapprehension, and delusion, is really the nature of the soul.

Acarya Samantabhadra'sAptamimalisa:
तत्त्वज्ञानं प्रमाणं ते युगपत्सर्वभासनम् । क्रमभावि च यज्ज्ञानं स्याद्वादनयसंस्कृतम् ॥ १०१ ॥
O Lord ! As per your teaching, that by which substances (souls and non-souls) are rightly known, or knowledge alone, is pramāņa (lit. the method of knowledge). Pramāņa is of two kinds: first, direct (pratyakşa) - omniscience (kevalajñāna) – which knows the whole range of objects of knowledge simultaneously, without gradation (akramabhāvī), and second, indirect (parokşa), which knows the objects of knowledge partially and in succession (kramabhāvī). Knowledge in succession features the doctrine of conditional predications - syādvāda, and ascertainment, without contradiction, of one particular state or mode of the object, called naya. स्याद्वादकेवलज्ञाने सर्वतत्त्वप्रकाशने । भेदः साक्षादसाक्षाच्च ह्यवस्त्वन्यतमं भवेत् ॥ १०५ ॥
Syādvāda, the doctrine of conditional predications, and kevalajñāna, omniscience, are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while kevalajñāna illumines directly, syādvāda illumines indirectly. Anything which is not illuminated or expressed by the two is not a substance of reality and hence a non-substance (avastu).

सामान्य सम्यक् श्रुतज्ञान परमार्थ विषय का कथन करने वाले एक पुरुषाश्रित कथा और तिरसठ शलाका पुरुषों सम्बन्धी कथा - रूप, पुण्यवर्धक तथा बोधि (रत्नत्रय की प्राप्ति) और समाधि ( धर्म्य और शुक्ल ध्यान की प्राप्ति) के निधान, प्रथमानुयोग को जानता है।
Right (scriptural) knowledge has (as its first constituent) the prathamanuyoga, comprising spiritual stories, called carita, of epochal individuals, and of the sixty-three great personages (salākā puruṣa), called purana, which is a treasure chest for enhancement of merit and purity of meditation.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The prathamanuyoga is an essential reading for the beginner and is particularly helpful in the acquisition of right faith. Some Scriptures that are part of the prathamanuyoga are:
Jambusvamicarita;

लोकालोकविभक्तेर्युगपरिवृत्तेश्चतुर्गतीनां च ।
आदर्शमिव तथामतिरवैति करणानुयोगं च ॥ ४४ ॥
Verse 44
सामान्यार्थ - (प्रथमानुयोग की तरह) मनन - रूप श्रुतज्ञान, लोक और अलोक के विभाग, युगों के परिवर्तन और चारों गतियों के (स्वरूप के) लिए दर्पण के समान, करणानुयोग को भी जानता है।
Right (scriptural) knowledge also has, as its constituent, the karaṇānuyoga, which knows and reflects, like a mirror, the three worlds (universe) and the beyond (non-universe), the worldly time-cycle, and the four stages of soul-existence.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The karaṇānuyoga reflects, as these are, the nature of the universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka), the worldly time-cycle in the regions of Bharata and Airāvata, and the four states of soulexistence infernal beings (nāraka), human beings (manusya), plants and animals (tiryañca), and celestial beings (deva).
The nature of the universe (loka) and the non-universe (aloka) has already been briefly discussed (pages 8 to 11 ante).
Jaina cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time (kalpakāla) in two parts or half-cycles (kāla) - ascending (utsarpiņi) and descending (avasarpiņi) each consisting of 10 x 1 crore x 1 crore addhasāgaropama (10 kotikoti sāgaropama). Thus, one cycle of time (kalpakāla) gets over in 20 kotikotī sāgaropama. During the ascending period (utsarpiņi) of the half-cycle (kāla), in the regions of Bharata and Airavata, there is the all-round increase in age, strength, stature and happiness of the living beings, while during the descending period (avasarpini) of the half-cycle, there is the all-round deterioration. Just as the moon continues its never-ending journey of waxing and waning
-

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
luminance, there is incessant and eternal revolution of the worldly cycle of time in these regions.
Each half-cycle is further divided into six periods of time. The periods in the descending (avasarpiņī) half-cycle are termed as:
1) suşamā-suşamā, of 4 kotikotī sāgaropama duration; 2) suşamā, of 3 kotikotī sāgaropama duration; 3) suşamā-duşamā, of 2 kotikotī sāgaropama duration; 4) duşamā-suşamā, of 1 kotikotī sāgaropama minus 42000 years
duration; 5) duşamā, of 21000 years duration; and 6) duşamā-duşamā, of 21000 years duration.
The ascending (utsarpiņī) half-cycle has the same periods of time but in reverse order. In this half-cycle there is the all-round, progressive increase in age, strength, stature and happiness of the living beings.
We are presently living in the fifth period (duşamā) of the descending (avasarpiņī) half-cycle. This period started after 3 years and 872 months of the liberation (nirvāṇa) of the 24th Tīrthankara Lord Mahāvīra.
The complete cycle (kalpakāla) of 20 kotikotī sāgaropama duration is represented in Fig.-2 on the next page.
A transmigrating soul can be in any of the four states of existence, technically called caturgati. These four states of existence are the infernal state, the subhuman state of animals and plants, the human state, and the celestial state. All transmigrating souls remain embodied according to their individual spiritual status. It has been said in the Scripture:
The soul indeed has taken in (enjoyed) successively all the molecules of matter in the entire universe and has cast them off. And the soul has been revolving many times over in the cycles of matter.

There is no point in the entire space of the universe which has not been the seat of birth of the soul. In this way, the soul has wandered in the entire universe space many times over. The transmigrating soul has been born and dead many times, in the ascending as well as in the descending aeons. Owing to its association with wrong belief, the soul has wandered, with different lifetimes, in all the states of existence, from the infernal regions up to the upper Graiveyaka heavens. Owing to its association with wrong belief, the soul is plunged in all the stages of the four types of bondage – nature, duration, intensity, and space - and wanders in the cycle of thoughtactivity.
Adapted from: Jain, S.A. (1960), “Reality”, p. 57-60.
It is owing to the influence of the associated karmic matter that the soul wanders about in the samsāra. Its natural rhythm of freedom is consequently lost and it undergoes all kinds of changes of form and state in the course of transmigration. Although characterized by pure knowledge and perception, it wanders about, over and over, without a break, in places inhabitable and uninhabitable. The karaṇānuyoga includes description of various kinds of karmas, their bondage and fruition, and stages of spiritual development (guṇasthāna).
Some Scriptures that are part of the karaṇānuyoga are: Trilokasāra; Tiloyapaņņattī; Gommațasāra - Jivakāņda; Gommațasāra - Karmakāņda; and Karmapraksti.

The lamp that is the dravyānuyoga spreads the light of right (scriptural) knowledge by illuminating the Reality of substances - soul (jiva) and non-soul (ajiva), merit (punya) and demerit (papa), bondage (bandha) and liberation (mokṣa), including influx (āsrava), stoppage (samvara), and gradual dissociation (nirjarā).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The dravyānuyoga illumines the Reality which is expressed through the seven tattva or the nine padartha. The soul (jiva) is characterized by consciousness. The non-soul (ajīva) is nonconscious. The inflow of karmic matter into the soul is influx (asrava). Virtuous activity is the cause of merit (punya) and wicked activity is the cause of demerit (pāpa). The mutual intermingling of the soul and the karmic matter is bondage (bandha). The obstruction to the inflow (asrava) of karmic matter into the soul is stoppage (samvara). The separation or falling off of karmic matter from the soul is dissociation (nirjară). The complete annihilation of all karmic matter bound with the soul is liberation (mokṣa).
Some Scriptures that are part of the dravyanuyoga are:

सामान्यार्थ - राग-द्वेष की निवृत्ति होने से हिंसादि पापों से निवृत्ति स्वयमेव हो जाती है क्योंकि जिसे किसी प्रयोजनरूप फल की प्राप्ति अभिलषित नहीं है ऐसा कौन पुरुष राजाओं की सेवा करता है? अर्थात् कोई नहीं।
With the destruction of attachment (rāga) and aversion (dveșa) there is self-annihilation of the causes of demerit (pāpa), like injury (himsā); without the desire for a reward, who would ever be found serving the kings?
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The state of desirelessness, i.e., to be without attachment and aversion in respect of desirable and undesirable objects, is the surest way to shun demerit. Ācārya Amộtacandra’s Puruşārthasiddhyupāya:
अप्रादुर्भावः खलु रागादीनां भवत्यहिंसेति । तेषामेवोत्पत्तिर्हिसेति जिनागमस्य संक्षेपः ॥ ४४ ॥ From the transcendental point of view (niścaya naya), nonmanifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury (ahimsā), and manifestation of such passions is injury (himsā). This is the essence of the Jaina Scripture.
Jain, Vijay K. (2012), “Shri Amritachandra Suri's Puruşārthasiddhyupāya”, p. 35.

For a person endowed with right knowledge, getting rid of the conduits of demerit (pāpa) comprising injury (himsā), falsehood (anrta), stealing (steya), unchastity (abrahma), and attachment to possessions (parigraha), is right conduct (samyakcāritra).

The ten vitalities1 (life-principles) are the five senses and so on.
1 The vitalities or life-principles are ten, namely the five senses, energy,
respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech and the mind. The onesensed lives possess four vitalities, the two-sensed six, the three-sensed seven, the four-sensed eight, the irrational five-sensed nine and the rational five-sensed all the ten.

Verse 53
The severance of the vitalities that are present (all the ten vitalities are not present in all living beings) is called injury. It is wicked as it causes pain and suffering to living beings. The qualifying phrase 'arising from passionate activity' is intended to indicate that mere severance of the vitalities is not wicked. “Even with the severance of life one is not stained with the sin of injury.” Again it has been said thus in the scriptures: “When a monk goes on foot with carefulness, sometimes small insects get crushed under his feet and die. Still there is not the slightest bondage of sin in his case. From the spiritual standpoint, infatuation is called attachment.” Now, has it not been admitted that mere passionate attitude even without the severance of vitalities constitutes violence? “He who acts with negligence commits injury whether death is caused to organisms or not. And he who proceeds with proper care does not contract bondage of karma by mere injury.” Yes, it is true. But there is no inconsistency in this. Even in the case of the person with negligence there is severance of life-principles at least in thought. It has been said thus in the scriptures. "He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial."

existent; 2) a statement that affirms the existence of an object that is not existent; 3) a statement that pronounces the existence of an object as another object; and 4) that speech which is condemnable (garhita), sinful (sāvadya), and unpleasant (apriya). Condemnable (garhita) speech comprises statements which may be spiteful and contemptuous, harsh, nonsensical, useless gossip, and also those contrary to the Scripture. Sinful (sāvadya) speech comprises statements which may be prompting others to engage in piercing, splitting, beating, ploughing, trading, or stealing, as such activities lead to the destruction of life. Unpleasant (apriya) speech comprises statements which may cause in others discomfiture, fear, regret, enmity, grief, hostility, or anguish.
Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's Purusārthasiddhyupāya”, p. 61-65.
Jain, Champat Rai provides the following explanation:
The ascetic's vow of truthfulness, it may be stated here, is of unbending rigidity; but as the present work is only concerned with the layman's duties in life, it does not describe the nature of the more austere vows. The use of the word 'gross' in connection with this vrata enables the householder to avoid its breach by relating stories, writing works of fiction, diplomacy and the like. The reason why truth with a tendency to cause affliction, is to be avoided needs no explanation. There are many occasions when speaking out truth causes unmerited suffering to others, and clearly silence would be golden in all such cases.

The Most Excellent saints call abstinence from the consumption of wine (madya), flesh (māńsa) and honey (madhu), together with the observance of five small vows (aņuvrata), as the eight fundamental virtues (mūlaguņa) of the householder.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Acārya Amrtacandra's Purusārthasiddhyupāya:
मद्यं मांसं क्षौद्रं पञ्चोदुम्बरफलानि यत्नेन । हिंसाव्युपरतिकामैर्मोक्तव्यानि प्रथममेव ॥ ६१ ॥ Those who wish to renounce himsā must, first of all, make effort to give up the consumption of wine, flesh, honey, and the five udumbara fruits (the five udumbara trees are Gular, Anjeera, Banyan, Peepal, and Pakar, all belonging to the fig class). मद्यं मोहयति मनो मोहितचित्तस्तु विस्मरति धर्मम् । विस्मृतधर्मा जीवो हिंसामविशङ्कमाचरति ॥ ६२ ॥ Wine deludes the mind and a deluded person tends to forget piety; the person who forgets piety commits himsā without hesitation. रसजानां च बहूनां जीवानां योनिरिष्यते मद्यम् । मद्यं भजतां तेषां हिंसा संजायतेऽवश्यम् ॥ ६३ ॥ Wine is the birthplace of many creatures that owe their

अभिमानभयजुगुप्साहास्यारतिशोककामकोपाद्याः । हिंसायाः पर्यायाः सर्वेऽपि च शरकसन्निहिताः ॥ ६४ ॥ Pride, fear, disgust, laughter, disliking, grief, sex-passion, and anger etc., are bywords for himsā; and all these go together with wine. न विना प्राणविघातान्मांसस्योत्पत्तिरिष्यते यस्मात् । मांसं भजतस्तस्मात् प्रसरत्यनिवारिता हिंसा ॥ ६५ ॥ Since non-vegetarian food cannot be produced without causing destruction to life, therefore, one who eats flesh necessarily commits himsā. यदपि किल भवति मांसं स्वयमेव मृतस्य महिषवृषभादेः । तत्रापि भवति हिंसा तदाश्रितनिगोतनिर्मथनात् ॥ ६६ ॥ Eating flesh of animals like buffalo and ox, which have died of themselves, also involves himsā due to the destruction of numerous subtle, unevolved, spontaneously-born living beings (nigoda.jivas) contingent on it. आमास्वपि पक्वास्वपि विपच्यमानासु मांसपेशीषु । सातत्येनोत्पादस्तज्जातीनां निगोतानाम् ॥ ६७ ॥ Subtle, unevolved, spontaneously-born living beings (nigoda jīvas) of the same genus originate constantly in pieces of flesh, whether raw, cooked, or being cooked. आमां वा पक्वां वा खादति यः स्पृशति वा पिशितपेशीम् । स निहन्ति सततनिचितं पिण्डं बहुजीवकोटीनाम् ॥ ६८ ॥ One who eats raw or cooked pieces of flesh, or touches them,

The senseless person who consumes honey is responsible for grave himsā. स्वयमेव विगलितं यो गृह्णीयाद्वा छलेन मधु गोलात् । तत्रापि भवति हिंसा तदाश्रयप्राणिनां घातात् ॥ ७० ॥ The person who consumes honey which drops down from the honeycomb on its own, or that obtained through some trick, is also responsible for himsā as, in both cases, destruction of subtle, unevolved, spontaneously-born living beings (nigoda jīvas), generated in honey, is caused. मधु मद्यं नवनीतं पिशितं च महाविकृतयस्ताः । वल्भ्यन्ते न वतिना तद्वर्णा जन्तवस्तत्र ॥ ७१ ॥ Honey, wine, butter, and flesh, these four substances provide media for growth of microbes and are, therefore, not suitable for consumption by a votary. These substances inhabit subtle, unevolved, spontaneously-born living beings (nigoda jīvas) of the same genus.

The limits are set with reference to well-known oceans, rivers, forests, mountains, villages, and marks of yojana* (a unit of length measurement), in the ten directions**.
* Some basic units of length measurement are as under:
24 utsedhāngula = 1 hātha 4 hātha
= 1 dhanusa (also known as danda or nādī) 2000 dhanusa = 1 kosa 4 kosa
= 1 yojana (conventional) While referring to continents, oceans and cosmic distances, Jaina cosmology employs the measure of mahāyojana (therein termed as yojana only) which equals 500 conventional yojana. Thus, when the Scripture refers to the diameter of Jambūdvīpa as 1 lakh yojana, it means 50000000 conventional yojana or 200000000 kosa.
**The eight directions of the compass - north, south, east, west,

Because of cessation of even subtle sins in the regions outside the limits set in the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to direction (digurata), the men observing this vow virtually observe the great vows (mahāvrata) outside their set limits.

even sinning in thought in respect of those places which one cannot reach. Hence, it is said that the observance of this vrata enables the layman's vows to approach the five mahāvratas of asceticism, in point of merit, beyond the limits fixed for his movements. In other words, the digurata places a layman on an equality with an ascetic in respect of the regions of space lying beyond the boundaries determined by him for his physical and mental activity.

Since the malignant (pratyākhyāna) class of conduct-deluding passions become extremely quiescent, to the extent that even their existence seems doubtful, the votary (the one observing the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to direction - digurata) is said to be virtually observing the great vows (mahāvrata) outside his set limits.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Karmas bound with the soul have the tendency to interfere with its natural functioning. Due to the influence of the karmas, the soul gets into a state of weakness and then acts in a manner inimical to its natural tendencies. The affinity between the soul and the karmic matter may be explained by the fact that the former is the knower and enjoyer of the latter. The soul is the enjoyer, and the matter, the object of enjoyment; hence the relation between them is that of the subject and the object. The interaction between the soul and the matter can take place only when the former is actuated by a desire for the enjoyment of sense objects, and, conversely, matter can affect the soul only when the soul is rendered vulnerable by its passions. The man under the influence of karmas cannot resist temptations and falls prey to four types of passions - anger, pride,

Verse 71
deceitfulness, and greed. As a consequence of the rise of passions in the soul, physical matter gets bonded with it, transforming itself into karmic matter, which then becomes known as the karmas of various kinds.
The four types of passions, mentioned above, are subdivided into four classes each according to their potency: 1. anantānubandhi – most malignant: that which leads to
endless cycle of worldly existence owing to wrong faith. 2. apratyākhyāna – highly malignant: that which arrests
even partial abstinence of the householder. 3. pratyākhyāna – malignant: that which enables the
householder's vows to be observed but stands in the way
of the more rigorous vows of the ascetic. 4. samjualana - gleaming: that which disturbs perfect
conduct. It gleams along with self-restraint or even in its presence self-restraint shines. It only debars the soul from
pure self-concentration. The potency of the four classes of passions has been likened to a line drawn on stone, on earth, on dust, and on water, respectively.
Jain, Vijay K. (2014), “Ācārya Pūjyapāda's Iştopadeśa – The Golden Discourse”, p. 87-88.
Jain, Champat Rai elucidates:
Anger, pride, deceit and greed are the four principal kinds of passions (kaşāyas). They are dealt with under four different heads in the Jaina Siddhānta, according to the degree of their intensity. The intensest, called the anantānubandhī, is the worst kind and prevents the acquisition of Right Faith itself; the intenser type, known as the apratyākhyāna, obstructs Right Conduct altogether and hinders even the observance of the minor vows of the householder; the intense, designated the

pratyākhyāna, enables the householder's vows to be observed, but debars one from the mahāvratas of asceticism and the higher forms of meditation; and the mild one sañjvalana only stands in the way of pure Self-contemplation (sukla dhyāna). The destruction or subsidence of the first type leads to the acquisition of Right Faith; of the second, to the adoption of the householder's vows; of the third, to the observance of mahāvratas; and of the fourth, to śukla dhyāna, which is the cause of omniscience and nirvāņa. This verse refers to the subsidence of the pratyākhyāna type which reduces the intensity of passions to the samjualana degree. These, as the āchārya points out, are of such a mild type that often it is difficult to say whether they exist or not

Abstaining from the commitment of five kinds of sins (injury, falsehood, stealing, unchastity, and attachment) by way of doing these by oneself, causing these to be done, and approval when done by others, through the three kinds of activity (of body, speech, and thought), constitutes the great vows (mahāvrata) of celebrated ascetics.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Fourteen stages of spiritual development (guṇasthāna)
The Three Jewels (ratnatraya) of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, together, constitute the path to liberation. Belief in the nine substances as these are is right faith. Knowledge of these substances without doubt, delusion or misapprehension is right knowledge. Being free from delusion and passions is right conduct. Omniscience is attained on the destruction of the deluding, the knowledge-obscuring, the perception-obscuring and the obstructive karmas. As long as the deluding karmas are very powerful, spiritual progress is very slow, if not impossible. How are the deluding karmas destroyed? The potential soul becomes a right believer and with growing purity of thought activity, starts its journey of spiritual progress.

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
From the empirical point of view, souls are divided into fourteen classes or spiritual stages (guṇasthāna).
Ācārya Pūjyapāda's Sarvārthasiddhi delineates the fourteen spiritual stages (guņasthāna) as under:
1. mithyādrsţi – deluded 2. sāsādanasamyagdssti – downfall 3. samyagmithyādrsţi – mixed right and wrong belief 4. asamyatasamyagdęsti – vowless right belief 5. samyatāsamyata - partial vows 6. pramattasamyata – imperfect vows 7. apramattasamyata – perfect vows 8. apūrvakaraṇa – new thought-activity 9. anivịttibādara-sāmparāya – advanced thought-activity 10. sūkşmasāmparāya - slightest delusion 11. upaśānta-kaṣāya – subsided delusion 12. kşīņa-kasāya – destroyed delusion 13. sayogakevalī – Omniscient with vibration 14. ayogakevalī – non-vibratory Omniscient
It is clear that real spiritual progress starts only after the acquisition of right faith. The sixth stage (guņasthāna), called pramattasamyata, is the first step in the life of a Jain monk (muni) as he embraces the great vows (mahāvrata). In this stage, the great vows are tinged with gleaming passions (samjualana kaşāya) which though do not hinder self-restraint but prevent the acquisition of perfect conduct (yathākhyāta cāritra).

EXPLANATORY NOTE
Acārya Pujyapada's Sarvārthasiddhi:
That, which leads to sin without any advantage, is purposeless sin. Desisting from such activity is to be free from purposeless sin. Purposeless sin is of five kinds, namely evil thought, preaching of sin, negligent activity, giving of hurtful things, and listening to undesirable stories. Wishing how others
may suffer from victory, defeat, punishment, bondage, mutilation, confiscation of all possessions and so on, is evil thought. Preaching sin is using words which incite others to cause sufferings to animals, to pursue commerce and activities causing injury to living beings and so on. Intoxicated activity is cutting trees, digging the earth, sprinkling water and so on, without any purpose. Giving hurtful things such as poison, thorns, weapons, fire, rope, whip, stick and so on is the fourth kind. The fifth kind is listening to or teaching of stories which provoke injury, lust, etc.

infinite jivas, therefore, all such vegetables must not be consumed.
Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's Purusārthasiddhyupāya", p. 105.
Jain, Champat Rai gives the following explanation:
The green roots and vegetables mentioned are forbidden on the ground that each of them is the abode of more souls than one; and butter is objectionable on account of its becoming the incubator of a certain kind of germs on a large scale within a very short time of its preparation. Jainism allows butter to be used by its followers only within an hour or so of its churning, though ghee (clarified butter) may be eaten at any time before it becomes unwholesome. The reason for this is to be found in the fact that butter becomes sterilized in the process of clarification and therefore unsuitable as a breeding ground for germs.

यदनिष्टं तव्रतयेद्यच्चानुपसेव्यमेतदपि जह्यात् । अभिसन्धिकृता विरतिर्विषयाद्योग्याव्रतं भवति ॥८६॥
सामान्यार्थ - जो वस्तु अनिष्ट-अहितकर हो उसको छोड़ें और जो सेवन करने के योग्य न हो वह भी छोड़ें, क्योंकि योग्य विषय से अभिप्रायपूर्वक की हुई निवृत्ति व्रत होती है।
Vow should be taken not to consume victuals which although not forbidden but are unsuitable for consumption (particular to each individual), and those which are not worth the consumption; only intentional abstention from an object of sense-indulgence is called a vow (vrata).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Eatables which although may not have been forbidden but are unsuitable for any reason, like being deleterious to health, need to be given up by a votary. Things, like cow-urine and milk of shecamel, which are considered unsuitable for consumption in refined cultures should also be left out from the individual's list of consumables, under a vow. Such a resolve to renounce even those things which one does not consume normally will augment the householder's small vow of ahimsā, the foundation of all vows.

नियमो यमश्च विहितौ द्वेधा भोगोपभोगसंहारात् । नियमः परिमितकालो यावज्जीवं यमो ध्रियते ॥ ८७ ॥
सामान्यार्थ - भोग और उपभोग के परिमाण का आश्रयकर नियम और यम दो प्रकार से व्यवस्थापित हैं (अथवा प्रतिपादित हैं ) । उनमें जो काल के परिमाण से सहित है वह नियम है ओर जो जीवन पर्यन्त के लिये धारण किया जाता है वह यम कहलाता है।
Restrictions on the use of consumable (bhoga) and noncomnsumbale (upabhoga) objects of sense-indulgence are set in two ways: when a time limit is specified, the restriction is called a niyama, and when there is no time limit (i.e., the restriction is for life), it is called ayama.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Consumables (bhoga) and non-consumables (upabhoga) which are forbidden in the Scripture must be renounced for life (yama). Objects of sense-indulgence which are not forbidden should be renounced either for life or for a specified period of time (niyama), depending on own strength and situation.

सामान्यार्थ - विषय - रूपी विष से उपेक्षा नहीं होना अर्थात् उसमें आदर रखना, भोगे हुए विषयों का बार-बार स्मरण करना, वर्तमान विषयों में अधिक लम्पटता रखना, आगामी विषयों की अधिक तृष्णा रखना, और वर्तमान विषयों का अत्यन्त आसक्ति से अनुभव करना (केवल वेदना के प्रतिकार की भावना से नहीं), ये पाँच भोगोपभोगपरिमाणव्रत के अतिचार कहे जाते हैं।
Not having a sense of withdrawal (or indifference) for the venom of sensual pleasures, thinking over and over again of sensual pleasures enjoyed in the past, excessive preoccupation with on hand sensual pleasures, intense craving for sensual pleasures, and enjoying sensual pleasures obsessively, are the five transgressions of the vow of limiting consumable and nonconsumable possessions (bhogopabhogaparimaṇavrata).

Restricting further, on a day-to-day basis or for a limited period, the field of activity only to certain regions out of the earlier fixed directions (under the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to direction - digurata), is called the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to region (deśāvakāśikavrata).

और बाहर - सम्पूर्ण रूप से (मन, वचन, काय और कृत, कारित, अनुमोदना से) पाँचों पापों का किसी निश्चित समय तक त्याग करने को सामयिक नाम का शिक्षाव्रत कहते हैं। The Most Learned ascetics have expounded that refraining completely (by way of doing by oneself, causing to be done, and approval when done by others, through the three kinds of activity - of body, speech, and thought) from commission of the five demerits (pāpa), at all places (within as well as outside the limits set under the vow of abstaining from activity with regard to region - deśāvakāśikavrata) for a fixed time period, is called the vow of periodic concentration (sāmayika, also sāmāyika), a limb of instructional vows-śikṣāvrata.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Ācārya Pūjyapāda’s Sarvārthasiddhi:
The preposition ‘sam’means one state of being. For instance, ghee becomes one with the thing mixed. Similarly oil also. To become one is samaya. That, which has oneness as its object, is sāmāyikam. One attains the great vows when one practises sāmāyika (concentration) at a particular place and time, since one is free from minute and gross injury and so on. It is argued that it would be perfect restraint and discipline (samyama). But it is untenable, as there is the presence of karmas or passions which arrest complete restraint. In that case these should not be called great vows. No. These are called great vows figuratively...

The sāmayika vrata is intended to be observed three times a day if possible; otherwise at least once daily. Its object is to enable the layman to abstain from all kinds of sins during the period of time fixed for its observance. The usual duration of the samayika vow is an antara muhūrta (a period of time not exceeding 48 minutes). During this period, which the layman spends in adoration and meditation, he vows to refrain from the commission of the five kinds of sin - hiņsā, falsehood, theft, unchastity and love of material possessions – with his mind, speech and body, in any of the three ways (krta, kārita, and anumodanā), both within and without the limits determined by him in connection with the deśāvakāśika vow.

Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra
In performing sāmayika the devotee stands facing north or east and bows to the pañca parameșthi. He then sits down and recites the namokāra mantra a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in: i) pratikramana, recounting the sins committed and
repenting for them, ii) pratyākhyāna, resolving to avoid particular sins in future, iii) sāmayika karma, renunciation of personal attachments,
and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body
and thing alike, iv) stuti, praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras, v) vandanā, devotion to a particular Tīrthankara, and vi) kāyotsarga, withdrawal of attention from the body
(physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the
contemplation of the spiritual Self. As regards place, the sāmayika may be performed anywhere - a temple, private residence, forest and the like – but the place should not be a thoroughfare, nor one that is open to disturbance. A place with evil repute or unholy associations is also to be avoided. The posture for sāmayika may be either - i) padma āsana, the sitting posture, with interlocked legs
(the right one placed on the left thigh and the left on the right), the hands placed in the lap with the palms facing upwards (the right one being on the top), and with
attention fixed on the foremost point of the nose; ii) kharga āsana, the standing posture, with feet at a
distance of about two inches from each other, the hands resting naturally by the sides, but not so as to touch the body; and attention fixed on the point of the nose as in the padma āsana; or

Verse 97
iii) ardha-padma āsana, the semi-padma posture, which
differs from the padma in respect of the position of the
left leg, which is placed under the right thigh. The sāmayika may be performed in a reclining or even a lying down posture if one is unable, from illness or some other cause of a like nature, to sit up. The above postures are recommended, because they are the most conducive to bodily steadiness and firmness. They may appear hard to adopt at first, but they will be found to be surprisingly easy after a little practice.

मूर्धरुहमुष्टिवासोबन्धं पर्य्यङ्कबन्धनं चापि । स्थानमुपवेशनं वा समयं जानन्ति समयज्ञाः ॥९८ ॥
सामान्यार्थ - आगम के ज्ञाता पुरुष केश, मुष्टि और वस्त्र के बन्ध के काल को और पद्मासन के काल को अथवा कायोत्सर्गासन (खड़े होने) के काल को और सामान्य आसन (बैठने) के काल को सामयिक के योग्य समय कहते हैं।
Learned sages have pronounced that the time for which the knot of hair on the top of the head is tied, the fist is closed, the knot on the piece of cloth is tied, or for which the padmāsana, the kāyotsargāsana, or the normal posture can be maintained, is the appropriate duration for observing the vow of periodic concentration (sāmayika).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
The verse can also be interpreted as referring to proper method for observing the vow of periodic concentration (sāmayika). The householder, as he gets ready for the sāmayika, should tie the knot of his hair on the top of the head, fingers clenched in the palm, and clothes properly set, so as not to cause any disturbance. The posture should be such that one can remain comfortable for the period of the sāmayika; the padmāsana, the kāyotsargāsana, or the normal posture with legs crossed are most suitable.
Jain, Champat Rai gives the following explanation:
The idea of tying a knot in one's choți (a tuft of hair on the top of the head worn by Hindus and Jainas) and the like, is not that the knot in itself is of any value or importance in the process, but that it implies a mental determination to continue

meditation so long as it remains untied. The knot is merely intended to serve the purpose of the uplifted hand of a constable, and is a signal for the stoppage of all kinds of mental 'traffic' which might interfere with steadiness and continuity of holy meditation.

The householder should strengthen, with a cheerful mind, his vow of periodic concentration (samayika) by choosing for it a venue which is without disturbance - like an uninhabited place, a forest, a house or a religious dwelling, a temple, or a mountainous cave.

Since the householder, when engrossed in the observance of the vow of periodic concentration (sāmayika), is free from all worldly occupations and attachments (external and internal), he at that time is like a digambara (sky-clad, nude) ascetic on whom someone has thrown, to cause him distress, a piece of cloth.

The householder established in the vow of periodic concentration (sāmayika) should meditate thus on the nature of worldly existence: helplessness – “I am utterly helpless; relatives, friends, and wealth cannot help me in the midst of
misery;" inauspiciousness (impurity) – “My body is the receptacle of impurities and the seat of unclean things;" transitoriness – “The body as well as the objects of the senses are transient like bubbles;" world is full of suffering – “He who wanders in the endless cycle of births and deaths undergoes millions of afflictions;” and all worldly objects are other than the Self – "All worldly objects are distinct from the pure Self." He reckons that the state of liberation (mokşa) has altogether opposite characteristics.

Ācārya Pūjyapāda’s Sarvārthasiddhi:
The word proşadha' refers to the holy days in the lunar month. Abstaining from the pleasures of the five senses such as sounds and dwelling in the self in deep concentration is fasting. It means giving up the four kinds of food. Proșadhe upavāsa is proşadhopavāsa, that is fasting on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar cycle. The fasting householder discards bodily adornments such as bath, perfume, garlands, and ornaments,
prosadha: the eighth and the fourteenth days of a fortnight, the bright
half and the dark half of the lunar month. - The five senses turn away from their pleasure of touch etc. and repose
in the self in deep concentration during fasting.

Four things are offered to the guest-food, implements, medicine and shelter. Pure food must be offered by the householder with a pure heart to the ascetic on the path to emancipation, who is earnest in practising restraint and discipline. Implements such as books which promote right faith and so on must be presented to him. Wholesome and proper medicine must be given to him.

The first āhāra of Lord Mahāvīra after His renunciation (dīkņā);
After spending 30 years as youth (kumārakāla), Lord Mahāvīra, reflecting on His past incarnations, decided to tread the path that leads to the end of the cycle of births and deaths. He contemplated on the twelve conceptions (bāraha bhāvanā) – transitoriness (anitya), helplessness (aśaraņa), transmigration (samsāra), loneliness (aikatva), distinctness (anyatva), impurity (aśuci), influx (āsrava), stoppage (samvara), dissociation (nirjarā), the universe (loka), rarity of enlightenment (bodhidurlabha), and Truth proclaimed by religion (dharma). The Lord renounced all worldly pursuits and decided to adopt the supremely worthy Jaina asceticism in order to tread the path to liberation. Laukāntika devas from Brahmaloka came down to
ship Him. The Lord had, by birth, the first three kinds of knowledge, sensory (mati), scriptural (śruta) and clairvoyance (avadhi) and now He had acquired the fourth kind of knowledge – telepathy (manaḥparyaya). The Lord took to the observance of great vows (mahāvrata) along with other attributes of asceticism and decided not to break His fast before the end of three days.
Although the Lord had been enjoying inner happiness all the time, after three days of Holy Meditation, the former Prince set out, barefoot, with no vestige of cloth on His body and unmindful of the pangs of hunger, towards the town of Kūlagrāma, ruled by king Kūla, to seek some kind of nourishment (āhāra) for His body so that it could withstand further rigours of austerity. King Kūla's happiness had no bounds when he suddenly saw such a divine, celebrated and accomplished recipient (pātra) in his compound and

rushed to welcome the Lord. He made obeisance to the Lord by circumambulating thrice and then bowed to Him by touching the ground with five parts of his body. He offered to the World Teacher an eminent, high seat. He washed with extreme devotion the Lotus Feet of the Lord and applied the water that had become sacred after coming in contact with the Lotus Feet of the Lord to his forehead and other parts of body. He worshipped the Lord with great devotion and with pure and pious eight substances. With utmost humility and purity of heart he bowed and pleaded the Lord to accept his offering. His affectionate devotion to the Lord had made his heart pure. By articulating the glory of the Lord, he made his speech pure. By performing the aforesaid bodily activities, he attained the purity of his body. He pronounced with sincerity the purity of food. This way, with nine kinds of devotion (navadhā bhakti), King Kūla gave the supreme gift of pure food to the greatest of all saints. The devas witnessed the event with extreme delight and in approval of the noble act of offering food to the Most Worthy Recipient, rained down choice gems, flowers, and fragrant water in the royal compound. They made cheering sound of "Victory! Victory!" and beat the heavenly drums.

Left: This typical posture - the thumb and fingers of right hand joined together and touching the shoulder - of a Jaina muni indicates that he is now ready for partake of food. Right: As the householder sees him, he welcomes him with utmost joy, chanting, "O Lord! I bow to you, I bow to you, I bow to you; here, here, here; stop, stop, stop."
As the muni stops, he is welcomed by the gesture of circumambulating him thrice.

Just as water, for sure, washes away blood, it is certain that giving of food (āhāra) to homeless (free from all external and internal attachments) saints (called atithi, as they arrive without prior notice) washes away the heap of karmas that the laities amass routinely in performance of household chores.

A frog, intoxicated with joy and with just a petal of a flower had shown to worthy (bhavya) souls, in the town of Rājagriha, the glory of worshipping the Lotus Feet of Lord Jina.
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Jain, Champat Rai gives the gist of the story:
The reference is to the jīva of a frog who obtained deva-birth in the heaven-worlds by devotion to the last Tīrthankara, Bhagwan Mahāvīra. This particular soul happened to be a miser in its previous incarnation when its evil karmas caused it to be re-born as a frog in the town of Rājagriha (Patna District). When the Holy Tīrthařkara visited that place, the frog recovered the memory of his past life owing to the fruition of good karmas, and coming to know the joyous tidings of the arrival of the Holy Tīrthankara, proceeded, full of devotion and love, to offer obeisance to the Lord. He was, however, crushed on the way under the foot of one of the elephants of the royal procession, which was also proceeding towards the same goal. Having died under the most auspicious circumstances, he was re-born in one of the heavens, and immediately descended to the earth to worship the source of his great good luck.

Embracing Voluntary, Passionless Death

passions emaciated by abandoning their sources gradually at the approach of death. The householder observes sallekhanā at the end of his life. "Joşitā' means observing it with pleasure. Hence sevitā, though clear in meaning, is not used. If there be no willingness, sallekhanā cannot be forced on one. If there is liking for it one does it oneself. It is argued that it is suicide, since there is voluntary severance of life etc. No, it is not suicide, as there is no passion. Injury consists in the destruction of life actuated by passion. Without attachment etc., there is no passion in this undertaking. A person, who kills himself by means of poison, weapon etc., swayed by attachment, aversion or infatuation, commits suicide. But he who practices holy death is free from desire, anger and delusion. Hence it is not suicide. “It has been taught by Lord Jina that the absence of attachment and the other passions is non-injury and that the rise of feelings of attachment and the other passions is injury.” For instance, a merchant collects commodities for sale and stores them. He does not welcome the destruction of his storehouse. The destruction of the storehouse is against his wishes. And, when some danger threatens the storehouse, he tries to safeguard it. But if he cannot avert the danger, he tries to save the commodities at least from ruin. Similarly, a householder is engaged in acquiring the commodity of vows and supplementary vows. And he does not desire the ruin of the receptacle of these virtues, namely the body. But when serious danger threatens the body, he tries to avert it in a righteous manner without violating his vows. In case it is not possible to avert danger to the body, he tries to safeguard his vows at least. How can such a procedure be called suicide?

The householder should court voluntary death (sallekhanā) at the end of his life, always thinking fervently that only this (sallekhana) will enable him to carry with him his wealth of piety.
मरणान्तेऽवश्यमहं विधिना सल्लेखनां करिष्यामि । इतिभावनापरिणतोऽनागतमपि पालयेदिदं शीलम् ॥ १७६ ॥
"I shall certainly, at the approach of death, observe sallekhanā in the proper manner.” Meditating persistently in this manner, the observance of the vow of sallekhanā starts much before the approach of death.

When death is imminent, the vow of sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderizing the body and the passions. Since the person observing sallekhana is devoid of all passions like attachment, it is not suicide.

In the observance of sallekhana, since passions, the instrumental cause of himsă, are subdued, sallekhanā is said to be leading to ahimsā.
Jain, Vijay K. (2012), "Shri Amritachandra Suri's Puruṣārthasiddhyupaya", p. 114-116. Sallekhana as expounded in Dharmamṛta (Sāgāra) – 13th century CE composition:
न धर्मसाधनमिति स्थास्नु नाश्यं वपुर्बुधैः ।
न च केनापि नो रक्ष्यमिति शोच्यं विनश्वरम् ॥ ८-५ ॥
Restraint is the instrument of dharma; a knowledgeable man, therefore, never injures his body that is steadily established in dharma. When destined for obliteration, no one – a shaman (yogi), a celestial being, or a demon - can rescue the body; there is no point in grieving for it.
कायः स्वस्थोऽनुवर्त्यः स्यात् प्रतिकार्यश्च रोगितः ।
उपकारं विपर्यस्यंस्त्याज्यः सद्भिः खलो यथा ॥ ८-६ ॥
When the body is healthy, noble men should try to maintain it through suitable nourishment and activity. When disease supervenes, appropriate medicines should be administered to cure it. If the body, ignoring the services rendered (for its maintenance and curing), acts in opposition and is no longer a means to the pursuit of dharma or the disease gets totally intractable, it needs to be shed as if a rogue.

fasting etc. so as to conserve the wealth of virtues (dharma) accrued in the present life. Without this, all that has been accrued goes waste. क्रमेण पक्त्वा फलवत् स्वयमेव पतिष्यति । देहे प्रीत्या महासत्त्वः कुर्यात्सल्लेखनाविधिम् ॥८-१२ ॥ As a fruit falls off the tree by itself on ripening, in the same way, when the body, due to passage of time and without any extraneous reasons, reaches the stage of dissolution, the wise householder should placidly embrace sallekhanā in the prescribed manner. धर्माय व्याधिदुर्भिक्षजरादौ निष्प्रतिक्रिये। त्यक्तुं वपुः स्वपाकेन तच्च्युतौ चाशनं त्यजेत् ॥८-२१॥ When confronted with unavoidable causes of death - like intractable disease, famine, dilapidation and calamity - then, with a view to carry the wealth of dharma earned in this life to the next, food should be abandoned while discarding the body. The same should be done on the approach of death due to expiration of life-span.
Pandit Kailashchandra Shastri (Ed.) (1978), "Panditapravara Āsādhara Viracita Dharmāmrta (Sāgāra)", p. 311-318. (English translation by the author in consultation with Jain, Jaipat Singh, 415 Oncrest Terrace, Cliffside Park, NJ 07010,
United States of America) Jain, Champat Rai elucidates thus:
Sallekkanā-death must be distinguished from suicide. It is undertaken only when the body is no longer capable of serving its owner as an instrument of dharma and when the inevitability of death is a matter of undisputed certainty. In such cases, when life may be said to confess judgment to the claim of death, the adoption of the sallekhanā attitude is

calculated to directly strengthen the soul and to prevent its future re-birth in any but the very best surroundings. Those who adopt the sallehhană vow immediately become self-reliant, self-composed and self-centred; they cease to be agitated by personal considerations and suffering, and rise above the cravings and longings of the world. The effect of the terribly resolute attitude of mind implied in this vow on the departing soul is simply wonderful, and immediately raises its rhythm, lifting it out of the slough of despond and negativity. The man who wanders or tosses about hither and thither, weeping and crying, in the closing moments of life, and spends the little time at his disposal in making vain endeavours to avoid the unavoidable, is nowhere compared with him who, realising the hopelessness of the endeavour to save his life, earnestly applies himself to control his destiny. The result is that, while the latter attains to deva-birth in the highest heavens, the former only finds himself in painful and unenviable circumstances and surroundings.
Jain, Champat Rai (1917), "Ratnakarnḍa-śravakachāra (or The Householder's Dharma)",

Sallekhana is not a custom (pratha or societal practice) The origination of a prathā or societal practice can be traced to expediency of time and space as ascertained by people according to their beliefs, and understanding. A prathā lacks universal appeal and acceptance and also sanction from established, time-tested sources of knowledge like the agama. It is practised only in reference to particular space and time. In India, one such societal practice, called the satī-prathā, was observed for a period of time; a widow would immolate herself on her husband's pyre, or would commit suicide in some other fashion shortly after her husband's death.

Verse 122
Sallekhanā, unlike a custom, is a pious vow, like non-injury and non-stealing, which every individual, young and old, male and female, looks forward to observing when the appropriate time comes. Even a young individual can say with pride and determination that he or she looks forward to observing sallekhanā at the time of death. And the elderly wishes and prays that at the time of death he or she should have the opportunity to observe the vow of sallekhanā. Could a married woman ever wish and pray to have the opportunity to observe the practice of satī? Sallekhanā is a reasoned, scientific way of facing death, an inescapable truth of life, and is applicable to and implementable by the whole of humanity.
Acārya Pūjyapāda’s Samādhisataka:
नष्टे वस्त्रे यथाऽत्मानं न नष्टं मन्यते तथा । नष्टे स्वदेहेऽप्यात्मानं न नष्टं मन्यते बुधः ॥ ६५ ॥ As one does not believe himself to have been destroyed when his clothes are destroyed, similarly the awakened man does not consider himself to be dead when his body dies away.
While the ignorant man is terrorized at the approach of death which entails separation of his soul from its perishable tenement, the knowledgeable man embraces death with equanimity knowing well that his animate soul is entirely distinct from its inanimate encasement. Devotees, men and women, of Lord Jina, in the prime of their lives, and with all comforts and riches of the world on hand, recite hymns like the one given below* that reflect their most cherished dream:
तेरी छत्रच्छाया भगवन् ! मेरे शिर पर हो । मेरा अन्तिम मरण समाधि, तेरे दर पर हो ॥
* “Samādhi Bhakti” composed by Ācārya 108 Vibhavasāgar Munirāja

O Lord ! May Your protective shadow be always on my head and may I attain a pious and passionless death (samādhi maraṇa) at Your doorstep.
Such an exalted place is accorded to sallekhanā in Jaina religious tradition! Sallekhanā surely must be embraced, as a vow, at the time of death. But death has its own strange ways of making appearance and, therefore, the idea of attaining a pious and passionless death must fill the mind, through and through, of a householder (śrāvaka) from an early stage of his spiritual development if he wishes to unfailingly impart ineffable worth to his present life.
Sallekhanā – the logical way to complete the journey of life All worldly souls (samsārī jīvas) are embodied according to their individual spiritual status, and are subject to the cycle of births and deaths. The body, associated with each soul, is subject to growth, old age, decay and death. Death entails that the soul must quit the existing body to acquire a fresh body consistent with and determined by the record of the karmic conditions, of which the soul itself is a repository. One of the most contentious issues in metaphysics is the relationship between the soul and the body. The Jaina metaphysics holds that the two are entirely different entities but live together for a certain period of time and then depart.
From the point of view of the modes in bondage, owing to the influence of karmas, the soul is corporeal in the embodied state. From the point of view of its pure nature, the soul is incorporeal. Though the soul is one with the body in the embodied state, it is different from the body because of its distinctive characteristics. The corporeal nature of the soul is predicated in the nonabsolutistic or relativistic sense only. From one point of view the soul is incorporeal, but from another point of view it is corporeal. A person is deluded when he identifies an animate object, soul (jīva),
198

Verse 122
as inanimate, and an inanimate object, non-soul (ajīva), as animate. A deluded person breeds attachment to the body which is intimately bound to him, and with persons or objects like friends, clothes, houses, riches and geographical territories, which are not so bound to him. He desires their possession, ownership and company, and their separation brings about grief to him. He spends his whole life in acquiring and then protecting them, and their inevitable separation causes unbearable misery to him. He lives under the fear of death.
All human beings who have not met with an untimely death pass through eight experiential stages in life – birth, infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth, adulthood, old age, and death. We are mostly dependent on others till we reach the stage of youth. In these formative years, most decisions pertaining to our upbringing are taken by others. As we reach adulthood, we become aware of our inherent likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses, and start pondering over matters like our objectives and goals in life. We take decisions on our career, family, and social life. By the time we reach the stage of advanced adulthood we have enough experience to look back to and vision to look forward to. We are mature enough to understand the meaning of life, its pleasures and pains. We are able to observe the ups and downs in the lives of people around us. More importantly, we are able to reflect on whether there is something we must do regarding the direction of our life, or live life just as it comes.
In our worldly life we seek pleasure and try to avoid pain and suffering. No sooner do we make headway in acquiring and then using an object of pleasure than a feeling of its inadequacy creeps into our mind. We want something superior in terms of both, the quality and the quantum of pleasure. We become slaves of pleasure. Typically, we over-indulge at night, get a terrible hangover the next morning, but crave for the same thing again at the fall of the night.

We get overpowered by the senses and become addicted to pleasures. As the harmful effects of this addiction on our mind and body surface in due course of time, realization dawns that perhaps we have moved too far ahead in the wrong direction. We get disheartened to see that pleasures are short-lived and are followed, sooner or later, by pain and suffering. Despondency sets in; we wish to do something about it but it is too late by then. Stark reality that we must leave behind, voluntarily, all material possessions strikes in our face. There is no escape from this plain truth; if we do not volunteer to do it ourselves, death will perform the act for us, ruthlessly. The idea of separation from our prized possessions leaves us in great pain and misery. Enjoyment of a few pleasures in the past is no solace to a grieving soul. Realization of this basic truth early in life can save us from much hardship and agony later on.
Wise men start looking at the realities of life and ways to cope with these as soon as the realization dawns that they have just one or two score years of the present life left. They clearly apprehend that the worldly existence is full of misery; disease, old age, separation from kith and kin, accident, natural disaster, failure, and death are but some of the realities of life that one has to run into. They take corrective actions to make the best use of the remaining years. While they commiserate with people living in conditions of poverty, deprivation, impa not allow despondency to set within themselves. They are not particularly attracted towards the pleasures that worldly objects have to offer. They realize that pain and suffering are inextricably linked to the worldly life and are attributed to our karmas.
Our virtuous karmas in the past have provided us with whatever good and enjoyable we have in this life and we must now make efforts to engage ourselves only in actions that will provide us with joyous feelings in the remaining years of this life, and the next.

Verse 122
When a man turns his consciousness exclusively to the Ideal of the pure soul, he is saved from indulging in activities that result in perennial entrapment in the world. Knowing the body as unconscious, mortal, and a product of karmas, one who does not undertake activities pertaining to the body performs the essentials of detachment from the body. The soul has the intrinsic attribute of darting upward and the body, being physical matter, is an instrument of pulling the soul downward. The body, being a direct outcome of karmas, is absolutely worth dissociation and detachment for anyone who is treading the path to liberation. Only with such discrimination between the soul and the body can one develop interest and inclination towards the soul and disinterest and disinclination towards anything that is antithetical to the soul.
The way to make human birth meaningful is through renunciation of worldly pleasures, and taking recourse to meditation, austerities, propagation of true faith, and finally attaining a pious and passionless death (samadhi marana) by relinquishing the body through the method of sallekhanā the gateway to the path to liberation.

vows partially but the ascetic to a very large extent. We know that our activities of the body, mind, and speech, when actuated by passion, result into bondage of karmas to our soul. Virtuous activity is the cause of merit (punya) and wicked activity is the cause of demerit (pāpa). Bondage of karmas that cause merit provides us with pleasant feeling, propitious life-span, auspicious rebirth, and high status. Although our ultimate goal is to attain liberation for our soul, but many a time we are not able to give up our desires completely. Still we restrain ourselves from undesirable activities by observing vows. In other words, we follow restraint with attachment. Such restraint is among the causes of influx of karmas leading to the celestial birth. Right belief is also the cause of influx of lifekarma leading to the celestial birth. The ultimate destination of all bhavya souls (having potential to attain liberation) is the supreme and everlasting state of knowledge, faith, bliss and power. Who in his senses would opt for this short life as a human being to be withered away in just acquiring, and then indulging in, the objects of sense-pleasures? The man well-versed in the Scripture is aware that the goal of liberation may be far away in time. Life as a human being, though short, provides a great opportunity to mould the future course of the soul for an exceedingly long period of time. As an instance, the minimum life-span in the heaven of Saudharma kalpa is a little over one palyopama and the maximum lifetime is little over two sāgaropama. The term palyopama is defined in detail in the Jaina scriptures; suffice it to say here that from the worldly standards it is an exceedingly long period of time. And a sāgaropama is 1015 times a palyopama! Life-spans in the hells too are very long; the maximum duration of life in the seven infernal regions is one, three, seven, ten, seventeen, twentytwo, and thirty-three sāgaropama, respectively.

1 The reader's attention is drawn to the distinction between the two stages represented by the 'Arhat' and the 'Siddha'. The attainment of omniscience is described in the first sutra of this chapter, and the attainment of complete liberation in the second. Omniscience is attained on the destruction of the deluding, the knowledge-obscuring, the perception-obscuring and the obstructive karmas, in the order mentioned in the first sutra. As long as the deluding karmas are very powerful, spiritual progress is very slow if not impossible. In that condition the self is almost a slave to the karmic forces at work and is

tossed to and fro in the ocean of transmigration. The secret of spiritual progress lies in the ascendancy acquired with great difficulty and effort by the self over the deluding karmas. Only then does the self become the master of evil and begin to succeed in overcoming evil. It is no doubt a tough fight between the self and evil, and there may be ups and downs in this long and arduous struggle. But the undaunted and unconquerable soul carries on the battle incessantly, gradually establishes ascendancy over the forces of evil, ultimately roots out evil with the help of pure concentration and becomes the Victor. This epic story of the struggles of the soul with the forces of evil may be read with absorbing interest in the several masterpieces of Jaina literature in Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada and other Indian languages. These fourthe deluding, knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring and obstructive karmas - are called destructive (ghāti) karmas, as these four main types of karmas interfere with the four infinitudes described in the fourth sutra, which are the essential characteristics of the soul. The other four main types are called non-destructive (aghāti) karmas, as these do not harm these four infinitudes. The self attaining omniscience becomes an Arhat, and the self attaining complete release a Siddha. There may be a longer or a shorter interval between the attainment of these two stages. That depends upon the lifetime still remaining on the manifestation of omniscience. And this may vary from soul to soul. Till the time of complete release, the Arhat is associated with the body. When the other four types of karmas are entirely destroyed, the released pure soul (Siddha) goes up to the summit of the universe and dwells there in eternal bliss.

Jain, Champat Rai writes:
This verse describes the effects of adopting the vows, sallekhan, and others, from the point of view of material prosperity, and shows that those who practise self-control, in the true sense of the word, rise to the most enviable positions in the world and become heir to unexcelled good fortune.

The householder who is purified by right faith, is unattached to the world, the body and the sensual pleasures, has taken refuge at the Holy Feet of the five Supreme Beings (pañca paramesthi), and is endowed with the eight fundamental virtues (mūlaguņa), is called the darśanika śrāvaka (first stage).

The householder who is free from stings (salya), and observes the five small vows-anuvrata, together with the seven silavrata (comprising three subsidiary vows gunavrata, and four instructional vows - sikṣāvrata) is called by the Most Excellent Votaries the vratika śrāvaka (second stage).

Acārya Pujyapada's Sarvarthasiddhi:
That which injures is a thorn or sting. Any sharp thing which causes pain to the body is a sting. Just as the sting causes pain to sentient beings, the emotional excitement arising from karmas, which causes bodily and mental pain, is figuratively called a sting. This is of three kinds, the sting of deceit, the sting of desire for enjoyment or pleasure, and the sting of perverse attitude (wrong faith). Māyā is deceit. Nidānam is desire for worldly pleasure and splendour. Mithya darśanam is wrong faith. He who is free from these three kinds of stings is called a

votary (urati). Now it is contended thus. 'A person is free from stings in the absence of stings, and one who observes vows is called a votary. But a person free from stings is not fit to be called a votary. For instance, a man who has a staff cannot be said to carry an umbrella.' The reply is this. The votary is one who is characterized by both the attributes, namely observing vows and being free from stings. So by merely practising vows, one cannot be called a votary, unless one is free from stings. What is meant is that, in the absence of stings, one who observes vows is a votary. For instance, a person is said to be rich in cows when he has plenty of milk and ghee. He cannot be said to be rich in cows in the absence of milk and ghee, even if he has several cows. So also, even if a person observes vows, he cannot be called a votary if he is not free from stings.

The householder who, standing in the kāyotsarga (nonattachment with the body), does three āvarta (turning round the joined palms clockwise) and one salutation each in the four directions, is rid of all external and internal attachments, performs two reverences in the sitting position (in the beginning and at the end of the sāmayika), maintains the purity of the three activities (of the mind, the speech and the body), and thus makes obeisance in the three times (morning, noon, and evening) of the day, is called the sāmayika śrāvaka (third stage).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Jain, Champat Rai explains:
Briefly put, the sāmayika śravaka is he who performs sāmayika three times a day. This consists in performing āvarta (joining the palms of both hands and moving them from right to left) three times in each direction, salutation to the Tīrthankaras, adoration of one or more of the twenty-four Arhantas (Gods), and the like.

Just as there is stronger attachment in the eating of a morsel of flesh than in the eating of a morsel of grain, in the same way, certainly, there is more attachment in eating at night than in eating during the daytime. अर्कालोकेन विना भुञानः परिहरेत् कथं हिंसाम् ।

The householder who casts off attachment (or infatuation) to the ten kinds of external possessions and with a deep sense of renunciation remains engrossed and contented in the true nature of his soul, is called the parigrahavirata śrāvaka (ninth stage).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
As infatuation caused by attachment to possessions (parigraha), internal and external, gets vanquished, and as the mind becomes steady through constant practice, one becomes capable of meditating on the pure soul.
Ten kinds of external possessions and fourteen kinds of internal possessions are said to be the causes of infatuation. The external possessions are (1) land, (2) houses, (3) gold, (4) silver, (5) cattle, (6) grain, (7) maid-servants, (8) male-servants, (9) clothes, and (10) utensils.
The fourteen internal possessions are (1) wrong belief, (2) malesex passion, (3) female-sex passion, (4) neuter-sex passion, (5) joking, (6) zest, (7) boredom, (8) grief, (9) fear, (10) disgust, (11) anger, (12) pride, (13) deceitfulness, and (14) greed.
These possessions cause the loss of equilibrium of the mind.

The man void of such possessions can concentrate his mind on the pure soul and attain excellent meditation.
Meditation which is directed towards the pure Self is the means of self-realization. Ignorance that stupefies the faculties of perception and will must be got rid of. There should be neither attachment nor hatred towards the objects of the environment. There should be unruffled peace in thought, speech and body. Meditation attended by such circumstances manifests like the fire that destroys the rubbish heap of the karmas.

(78-8-888) O Lord Jina! Desisting from injury to living beings is known in this world as the Supreme Holiness. This Supreme Holiness cannot be found in hermitages which advocate even the slightest of activity (ārambha) that causes pain and suffering to the living beings. Therefore, with extreme benevolence, to attain the purity of non-injury, you had relinquished both the internal as well as the external attachments, including the degrading clothes and other add-ons to the body.

The householder who, leaving his home, goes to the spiritual preacher in the forest, adopts vows, lives on food obtained through religious solicitation, observes austerities, and accepts only a loincloth, is to be known as the uddistavirata śrāvaka (eleventh stage).
EXPLANATORY NOTE
Jain, Champat Rai has this explanation which throws adequate light on the verse:
The highest point of a householder's conduct is reached in the eleventh pratimā which takes him to the door of asceticism. This pratimā, called the uddişța (that which has been ordered or mentioned beforehand) tyāga (renouncing) is indicative of the mental determination of the aspiringjīva to avoid accepting anything in the shape of food by special invitation or appointment. It comprises two kinds of householders: (1) kşullaka and (2) ellaka. The kşullaka wears a langoțī* and a sheet of cloth, three cubits long and of a single width, but the ellaka rejects the wrapper and keeps only the langoțī. They both keep a bowl, for carrying water, and a whisk of the softest

peacock feathers for removing insects from their person, books and the like, without injuring them. As regards begging, for food, a kşullaka, if he belong to any of the three higher castes should eat only what he gets from one household, but he may visit five houses, one after another if he happen to be aśūdra. In no case should he call at another house after getting sufficient food for the day, but should sit down and eat his repast at the place where the quantity of his daily rations is completed. While calling for food, he should not penetrate beyond the court-yard, hall or vestibule, nor ask or beckon for food, but should only wish the inmates dharma lābha (may you obtain spiritual merit) and recite the ņamokāra mantra. If he be not observed or welcomed with due respect, he should immediately depart from that place and proceed to another. In no case should he call at that house a second time that day. The ellaka also observes these rules, but he eats what is obtained from one kitchen alone. Both the kşullaka and the ellaka eat only once a day, and go out in search of food between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning.

चरिया पमादबहुला कालुस्सं लोलदा य विसयेसु । परपरितावपवादो पावस्स य आसवं कुणदि ॥ १३९ ॥ Inordinate taste for worldly things, impure emotions, hankering for and indulging in sensual pleasures, causing anguish to fellow beings, and slandering them openly or covertly; these constitute the spring of evil. सण्णाओ य तिलेस्सा इंदियवसदा य अत्तरुद्दाणि* । णाणं च दुप्पउत्तं मोहो पावप्पदा होंति ॥ १४० ॥

The different animal instincts, the different soul-soiling emotions, the tempting senses, suffering and wrath, undesirable thoughts and corruption of the faculties of perception and will; these constitute the spring of evil.
Verse 148
Chakravarti Nayanar, A., "Acarya Kundakunda's Pañcāstikāya-Sāra", p. 112-115.
Acārya Samantabhadra's Āptamīmāṁsā:
विशुद्धिसंक्लेशाङ्गं चेत् स्वपरस्थं सुखासुखम् । पुण्यपापास्त्रवौ युक्तौ न चेद्व्यर्थस्तवार्हतः ॥ ९५ ॥
When pleasure and pain in oneself and in others are due to the limbs (anga) of the auspicious kind of disposition (viśuddhi)1, these are causes of the influx of meritorious karmas (punya). When pleasure and pain in oneself and in others are due to the limbs of the inauspicious kind of disposition (samklesa)2, these are causes of the influx of demeritorious karmas (pāpa). O Lord! In your view, if pleasure and pain in oneself and in others are not due to the auspicious or inauspicious kinds of dispositions then there cannot be influx of meritorious or demeritorious karmas; these do not yield any fruit.
Jain, Vijay K. (2016), "Acarya Samantabhadra's Aptamīmāmsā", p. 148.
1 auspicious kind of disposition (viśuddhi) - due to virtuous (dharmya) and pure (śukla) kinds of concentration. There are three limbs (anga) of the auspicious kind of disposition - its cause (kārana), its effect (karya), and its own-nature (svabhāva).
2 inauspicious kind of disposition (saṁklesa) - due to sorrowful (ārta) and cruel (raudra) kinds of concentration. This also has three limbs - its cause (kāraṇa), its effect (karya), and its own-nature (svabhava).

May Lakşmi of right faith, the beholder of the Lotus Feet of Lord Jina, herself the land of happiness, make me happy as a sensual woman satisfies a lascivious man, protect me as a noble mother protects her child, and purify me as a girl adorned with the ornament of virtue purifies her family.
Thus ends the seventh part called Eleven Stages (pratimā) of the Householder's Conduct
of the Ratnakarandaka-śrāvakācāra, composed by Acārya Samantabhadra Svāmi.

Tattvārthsūtra is invaluable for understanding life, and pursuit of happiness. The hardships and afflictions that we have to endure are of our own making. Our deeds, driven by passions, lead to sufferings and reproach in this world and the next. Virtuous activity alone, which is the cause of merit (punya), leads to joyous feeling, auspicious life, charming and lustrous physique, and high status. Our ultimate goal is the attainment of the divine attributes, in fullness and perfection, of our souls. We can reach the goal only through the threefold path of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct (ratnatraya).

As Achārya Vidyanand writes in the Foreword of Samayasāra, it is the ultimate conscious reality. The enlightened soul has infinite glory. It has the innate ability to demolish karmas, both auspicious as well as inauspicious, which constitute the cycle of births and deaths, and are obstacles in the path to liberation. Samayasāra is an essential reading for anyone who wishes to lead a purposeful and contented life. It provides irrefutable and lasting solutions to all our problems, concerning worldly ways as well as spiritual curiosities and misgivings.

Shri Amritchandra Suri's Purusārthasiddhyupāya is a matchless Jaina text that deals with the conduct required of the householder (śrāvaka). In no other text that deals with the conduct required of the householder we see the same treatment of complex issues such as the transcendental and the empirical points of view, cause and effect relationships, and injury and non-injury, maintaining throughout the spiritual slant. The basic tenet of Jainism - noninjury or Ahimsā - has been explained in detail in the book.

Dravyasamgraha is one of the finest classical Jaina texts, composed by His Holiness Acarya Nemichandra (c. 10th century CE). It deals primarily with the Realities (tattvas) that contribute to world process. The conduct required for attaining the ultimate goal of liberation follows from the knowledge of these Realities. Both, the transcendental and the empirical points of view, have been considered while explaining the nature of substances, souls and non-souls. It will be of much use to scholars worldwide interested in pursuing the study of Jaina epistemology.

His Holiness Ācārya Pūjyapāda, who graced this earth around 5th century CE, had crafted some valuable gems of Jaina doctrine, including Sarvathasiddhi and Iṣṭopadeśa. Concise but deep in import, Istopadesa unambiguously establishes the glory of the Self. It is an essential reading for the ascetic. The householder too who ventures to study it stands to benefit much as the work establishes the futility of worldly objects and pursuits, and strengthens right faith, the basis for all that is good and virtuous.

Acārya Samantabhadra's Svayambhustotra (2nd century CE) is a fine composition in Sanskrit dedicated to the adoration of the Twenty-four Tīrthankara, the Most Worshipful Supreme Beings. Through its 143 verses Svayambhūstotra not only enriches reader's devotion, knowledge, and conduct but also frees his mind from blind faith and superstitions. Rid of ignorance and established firmly in right faith, he experiences ineffable tranquility and equanimity. The book has two useful Appendices. Appendix-1 attempts to familiarize the reader with the divisions of empirical time that are used extensively in Jaina cosmology. Appendix-2 provides a glimpse of life stories, adapted from authentic Jaina texts, of the Twenty-four Tīrthankara.

Aptamīmāmsā by Ācārya Samantabhadra (2nd century CE) starts with a discussion, in a philosophical-cum-logical manner, on the Jaina concept of omniscience and the attributes of the Omniscient. The Ācārya questions the validity of the attributes that are traditionally associated with a praiseworthy deity and goes on to establish the logic of accepting the Omniscient as the most trustworthy and praiseworthy Supreme Being. Employing the doctrine of conditional predications (syāduāda) – the logical expression of reality in light of the foundational principle of nonabsolutism (anekāntavāda) - he faults certain conceptions based on absolutism. He finally elucidates correct perspectives on issues including fate and human-effort, and bondage of meritorious (punya) or demeritorious (pāpa) karmas.

________________ धर्मानुरागी श्री विजय कुमार जी जैन, देहरादून, ने रत्नकरण्डकश्रावकाचार का अंग्रेजी संस्करण तैयार करके जिनवाणी की महती सेवा की है। उन्हें मेरा मंगल आशीर्वाद है। मई 2016, नई दिल्ली आचार्य 108 श्री विद्यानन्द मुनि Ratnakarandaka-sravakacara, comprising 150 verses, is a celebrated and perhaps the earliest Digambara work dealing with the excellent path of dharma that must be followed by the householder (sravaka). All efforts should be directed towards the acquisition and safekeeping of the Three Jewels (ratnatraya), comprising right faith (samyagdarsana), right knowledge (samyagjnana) and right conduct (samyakcaritra), that lead to releasing him from worldly sufferings and establishing him in the state of supreme happiness.
