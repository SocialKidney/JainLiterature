PUBLISHER'S NOTE. It is with a heavy heart, and a palsied pen that I have laboured to write these few lines.
"The Sacred Books of the Jainas” reminds me of the passing away of my very dear friend Kumar Devendra Prasada Jaina, who founded the above “Series " and published in 1917, its first volume,“ Dravya Samgraha”, a monumental work on Jaina Philosophy by Acharya Shri Nemichandra Siddhant Chakravarti, translated and edited by Mr. Sarat Chandra Ghoshal, M. A., B. L., Saraswati, Kavya-Tirtha, Vidya Bhushan, Bharati, with a learned Introduction covering 48 pages, and exhaustive commentaries. The original text consists of 58 verses only, but their translation, and commentaries cover 123 pages of Royal Size. Dear departed Devendra was a born publisher. The publication of the highest authoritative works of Jaina Acharyas for the glory of Jainism and for the benefit of Humanity was the one aim and ambition of his life, for which he sacrificed his worldly prosperity, his College career, and even his life.
With his boundless enthusiasm, single-minded devotion, and selfless exertions, he succeeded in securing the co-operation of scholars of exceptionally high attainments, like Professor A. Chakravarti of the Presidency College, Madras, and Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., (Oxon.) Bar-at-law, Judge, High Court, Indore.
Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., M.R.A.S., then Chief Justice of Indore. translated and edited the Tattwarthadhigama Sutra, which he has very appropriately called the Jaina Bible, and followed up by under-taking the translation with commentaries of Gommatsara, the Encyclopaedia of Jain Philosophy. This work was begun by him in the Chaturmása, the rainy season, of 1927, when Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasadaji stayed with him, and helped him. The printing was commenced in the rainy weather of 1926, when Brahmachariji decided to stay at Ajitashram and supervise the work.

The whole text of this work, and of Part 1 of Karma Kanda had been printed off in March 1927. The stock of feather-weight paper which was being used for the work was completely exhausted before the Index, etc. and title pages could be printed. The mills also had no more such paper left in stock. An order was placed with them to manufacture such paper afresh, and thus an unexpected delay has been occasioned in the publication of Gommatasára.
This sudden breakdown was an extremely unfortunate circumstance. The intense poignancy of this mishap was felt on the sudden receipt of a wire from Indore announcing the death of Mr. J. L. Jaini. Alas, this great master of Jaina Philosophy could not live to see the greatest monumental work of his life in the shape of a bound volume. It saddens my heart so much, when the discussions he had with me in May last, as to the manner and quality of the binding come to my mind.
This is my first venture as a publisher; and the responsibility has been forced upon me by the miserable decree of Fate which has taken away from us the Founder-Publisher of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, and the incomparable author of two of the most authentic, ancient, and standard works of Jaina Philosophy.
The defects, for which I am responsible, are too many to escape notice. I have no justification to plead in self-defence. I confess my short-comings, and throw myself on the indulgence of the benevolent readers of this volume.
The depth and vastness of the knowledge displayed here-in, and the thorough and exhaustive analysis of the endless varieties of mental vibrations is amazing and fascinating indeed.
Gommatsara will, I hope, be found to be a real treat by the scholar, the seeker after truth, the Jnáni and the Dhyáni, and will, for the Right Believer, prove a practical guide to the path of Liberation.

PREFACE.
My "Outlines of Jainism" was published by the Cambridge Uni. versity Press for the Jaina Literature Society, London, in 1916, in advance of a series designed to consist principally, but not exclusively, of translations from authoritative texts. The aim was to put the whole Jaina Canon in brief on one bookshelf. In pursuance of this idea, which I brought back with me from Oxford and London in 1910 and 1913, the Jaina sacred texts began to be translated. My friend, the late Kumár Devendra Prasáda was in constant consultation with me. With his most enthusiastic and inimitable love for the work, he published some Jaina works and then started the Sacred Books of the Jaina Series, with the splendid First Volume of Dravya Sangraha, edited by Mr. S. C. Ghosal in 1916. My Tattvártha Sútra followed as the Second Volume in 1920, The learned Prof. A. Chakravarti gave us the Third Volume as Panchásti Káya at the end of the same year. Purushártha Siddhyupaya, with translation and Commentaries was prepared by my learned brother Pandit Ajit Prasada, of Ajitashram Lucknow; and the Indian Press of Allahabad had printed about half the book when the Kumár suddenly died.
On the 14th December 1920 Kumar Devendra Prasáda wrote to me, saying "Volume V be your Gommațasára.” I take this as a testamentary wish of a beloved soul and therefore publish this translation as Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas. Volume Fourth, Purushártha Siddyupaya is also in Press.

This translation of Gommațasára Jivakanda was made in the rainy season of 1917 at Indore. In 1918, I fell most seriously-ill with influenza and double pneumonia, and only in 1919 it became for the manuscript to begin to be published at the instance of the late lamented Kumar Devendra Prasáda of Arráh, in the Jaina Gazette. Madras. After 79 gáthás had been published, it was decided not to publish it in this periodical fashion, but to print it as a book at once. On 17th April 1921, to the great loss of the cause of publication of Jaina Literature, the young, energetic and talented Kumár died. The work of publication was postponed.
In 1922, I wanted to undertake to publish it myself but I found that the late Kumár had mislaid or lost Gáthás 79 to 250. My health and many official duties forbade a re-translation of the Gáthás myself; therefore under my supervision, I had the work done by kind and obliging friends. Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachári Sital Prasáda did it in 1923 with the help of the brilliant Scholar and Sanskrit Professor Hírá Láll Jain, M.A., LL. B.. of the Government College, Amráotí. The gap in the Ms. being thus filled, it was once more complete. The Devendra Printing Press at Madras was being started by Mr. C. S. Mallináth, the enthusiastic Editor of the Jaina Gazette, and he wanted to publish the Ms. My learned brother Professor A. Chakravartí, M. A., I. E. S. of the Presidency College, Madras, kindly undertook to help Brahmacháríjí if he went to Madras to supervise the publication. This was in 1924. I was ill again from June 1924 to February 1925. On my recovery I took up the question once more. But owing to Antaráya (obstructive) Karma, a serious attack of diabetic Coma prostrated me on almost a death-bed from December 1925. On my return home from Hospital in May 1926 I made up my mind to publish this and my other unpublished Manuscripts, anyhow.
Brahmacháríjí readily, promptly and almost eagerly came up with his generous help of time and trouble. My learned and revered brother Pandit Ajit Prasáda, M. A., LL. B., late Government Pleader of Lucknow, agreed to collaborate. The famous Newal Kishore Press, Lucknow undertook the publication. Thus being equipped with men and munition for this warfare against deadly ignorance and superstition, I bade Brahmachariji Godspeed to Lucknow in July 1926.
When the book was in Press, Brahmachariji got the last Gathás 79 to 250 also from Arrah in August 1926, after such trouble in replacing them in 1922 !

﻿________________

I have given this longish history of the delay in publication to bring out a few points :
(1). All important Manuscripts must be kept most carefully. The risk of loss by moths or in transit etc., must be avoided.
(2). If possible, more than one copy of the Manuscript should be typed, to guard against any irreplaceable loss of it.
(3). The Manuscript as soon as it is ready may be given even to some Jaina periodical to be published. It is easier to reprint it in book form later, when many mistakes can be avoided and corrections made.
(4). True lovers of Jainism, learned men and rich men, should co-operate and organise the public service of the community in such a manner that the invaluable work of the preservation and propagation of Jaina Sacred Books in all important languages may be accelerated.
As to the great authority and veneration of Shri Gommațasára, it is enough to say that if Tattvártha Sútra is the Jaina Bible, the Gommatasára is a brief expansion of a part of that Bible, giving the Path to Perfection or Liberation.
The Path is clear and conclusive. If followed, it leads to the Goal, Liberation,
The Goal cannot be attained without following it.
The Soul-Classes, Quests and Stages, given in this book, may be verified by anyone easily with the necessary time, trouble, inclination and sympathetic realisation of the Word of the Omniscient, any day, in any condition of life, in any part of the World.
To follow the Path, it is not necessary to be born a Jaina or to profess or embrace Jainism. Call yourself by whatever name you like, live your life as you have lived it hitherto, but if it is in accord with Jainism, if it conforms to the type and measure of faith, knowledge and conduct leading to the Goal, the soul may be sure that he or she is a Liberable being and on the Path to Truth, and Freedom from the miseries and limitations of embodied existence.
-You build yourself. The Soul is the sole architect of its life and condition, here and hereafter. As such, believers in Jainism and those who come to consider and weigh Jainism in their search after Truth will find this translation a valuable guide.

The mistakes in the matter and manner of the book are proofs of my incapacity to grasp and reflect even one distant broken ray of the great Sun of Omniscience, from which direct descent is rightly claimed by the book and its contents. In all humility, I beg to be pardoned for this; and the indulgent learned, I am sure, will forgive an ignorant and humble admirer of theirs for his inevitable shortcomings. Indeed all my Jaina writings are really a poorlyequipped student's First Notes. I am not a Samskrit or Prakrit Scholar. Then my excursions into Jainism have been few and occasional. But they have been always most honest, concentrated and with a soul eager and fully devoted to know the Truth of Jainism.
My aim has been not to justify or defend or even to explain Jainism; but simply to record its whole tradition in its entire purity.
In conclusion, I must thank Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahma : chárí Sital Prasáda and Pandit Ajit Prasáda, M. A., LL.B. for their unrepayable obligation upon me, in seeing the book through the Press at the cost of so much time and trouble.

INTRODUCTION,
The Name and Origin of the Book
Gommațasára.
The probable reasons for the name Gommațasára having been assigned to this authoritative work on Jain Philosophy may be summed up as below.
In the Karma Kanda Gatha 965, the author says that this treatise is based on the discourses of Shri Vardhamána, the 24th and the last Jain Tirthankara of the present era in Bharata Kshetra, and the teachings are also well established by the rules of logic, Pramana and Naya. The author has called Shri Vardhamana or Mahávíra by the name of Gommaţadeva.
The word Gommata is probably derived from “ go" speech, and "mata" or "matha" abode, meaning "the Abode of Speech," the Lord from whom flows the letterless voice, the wonderful music. Divya-Dhvani. Sára means the essence, the condensed purport. The word Gommațasára would thus mean the “ Essence of the Discourses of Lord Mahavíra".
Again, we learn from the Samskrit commentary, that the treatise is a compilation of the answers given by the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravartí, to the questions put to him by Rájá Chámunda Raya, asking him to enumerate the sub-classes of bodymaking Karma, and to explain their existence, bondage, non-bondage, and cessation of bondage, with regard to the spiritual stages of

souls in various conditions of life from the fine completely undevelopable vegetable bodied soul, to the fully developed rational fivesensed beings. The answers are based on the ancient manuscripts, Dhayala, Jaya Dhavala and Mahá Dhavala, still preserved in needle pricked characters on palm-leaves in the Jain temple at Müdbidri, South Canara, India. The major part of Gommațasára is based on Dhavala, which was composed by Achárya Bhútabali about 7th century after Lord Mahávíra.
Chámund Raya was also called Rájá Gommata most probably on account of his great devotion to Shri Gommața Deva or Lord Mahávíra. As a complement to the Great questioner, the compilation has been called Gommațasára after his name.
Chámunda Raya. Chámunda Raya was a brave general and a great minister of the Jain King Rájá. Rájamalla who reigned from 974 to 984 A. C. (after Christ), and belonged to the Ganga dynasty.*
The ancestors of this Jaina dynasty ruled at Ayodhya, and were descended from the ancient Ikshwáku family, founded by Rishabhadeva, the first Tírthankara. Once it so happened, that Vijaya Mahá Devi, wife of Rája Bharata, a descendant of the family, while pregnant, went to take a bath in the Ganges. A son was born to her there, and was on account of this circumstance, named Ganga Datta. He became a renowned King and the Dynasty was called Ganga-Vansha after his name. In this dynasty Mahárája Vishnu Gopa flourished at Ahichchatrápore (near Bareily, U. P.) He had two sons from his wife Prithvi-mati, named Bhagadatta and Shri Datta. Bhága Datta went to the Kalinga country(near Orrissa),ruled there and established the Kalinga Ganga dynasty. Shri Datta continued to rule at Ahichchatra. Rájá Padma Nábha was a descendent of his. He had two sons named Ráma and Lakshman. In consequence of some dispute with Raja Mahipal of Ujjain (Malva), he had to leave Ahichchatra for Deccan with his sons, whose names he changed to Didiga and Madhava. They wert to Perur in District Codappa in the Madras Presidency and offered respects to the learned and spiritually advanced Acharya Sinha Nandi, who bestowed spiritual blessings on them. They established their power near Mysore in the second century after Christ. The 21st King in descent from Madhava who commenced to rule in 103 A.C. was Rájá Malla II.
Chámunda Ráya belonged to the clan of Brahma Khsatriya. He won many battles and received many titles, like Samara-Dhurandhara

"the leader in battle," Vira Mártanda, "the sun among the brave," Rana Raja Sinha, “a great Lion in battle," Vairí Kula Kála Danda “The sceptre of death for the hosts of enemies," Bhuja Mártanda "The sun among the powerful-armed." Samara Parshurama, "Parashurama in battle," Satya Yudhisthira, “Yudhisthira in speaking truth.” He was great scholar also. He wrote a commentary* on Gommațasára, in the Canarese language in presence of the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti. He also composed Chámunda Ráva Purana in Canarese and Charitra sára, a treatise on the practices of ascetics in Samskrit.
Appreciative mention of Rájá Chámunda Ráya has been made by the author in Karma Kánda Gáthá 966 to 972. Raja Chámunda Raya took vows of a layman from the Great Saint Ajitasena, who was a disciple of the order of Acharya Aryasena, as stated in Gatha 734 of Jíva Kánda. Rájá Chámunda Ráya constructed a beautiful Jaina. Temple now called Chámunda Ráyá Basti at Chandragiri in front of Vindhvagiri at Shravana Belgula, district Hasan, Mysore, containing a beautiful image of Shri Nemi Náth to whom our author has offered obeisance on several occasions in Gommațasára.
He constructed in 983 A. C. the great and wonderful image of Shri Bahubali, called Gommața Swami, Gommateshvara, "the Lord of Gommata" after his name.
Bahubali was one of the sons of the first Tirthankara Rishabha Deva and ruled at Podnápore. He had a contest with his eldest brother Bharata and defeated him. But he felt so distressed on this account that he renounced all temporal power and adopted an ascetic life. He practised the severest austerities. He stood unmoved for a whole year, in the standing posture, in meditation, so deep and concentrated that creepers spread and entwined themselves round his legs and arms. He was the first who obtained omniscience in this Avasarpiní cycle in Bharata Kshetra even before Lord Rishabha. His unsurpassed severe austerities have been very often extolled in Jaina Shastras. The wonderrul image at Vindhyagiri represents this exemplary attitude of meditation..
The grandeur of the Image, as also its serene-looking and peace-inspiring presence, are well-known to all Jainas and nonJainas who have had the good fortune of visiting it. When I visited the sacred place in 1910, I met some English men and women missionaries, who out of respect for the Holy Image took off their shoes and visited it in their bare feet. They also held the opinion
*Keshava Varni has based his Commentary on Gommatasara on this work.

which I have given above. The Image is about 57 feet high and still every limb and minor limb thereof is in exquisite proportion. It is impossible to convey its glory and artistic excellence by words. Any one who has the chance of seeing it personally will easily agree with the hitherto general opinion.
*
This gives an answer to some critics also who call the Jainas Idolatrous. The Jainas do not worship the stone, silver, gold or diamond of which the Images are made. They worship the qualities of Total Renunciation of the World, the Acquisition of undisturbable Harmony with the Infinite, and the Identity of the Liberated Soul with Peace everlasting, which these Images represent. Shakespeare with traduction :
Also to quote
"Ah me! how sweet is Jina itself possessed, When but Jina's shadows are so rich in joy!" (Romeo and Juliet),
Where I substitute "Jina " for "Love". It is clear how irresistible and experientially axiomatic must have been the Peace and Guidance given by the Arhats and Omniscients, when their mere Images are so potent of Grace, peace and inspiration.
So much for the origin of the name Gommaṭasára.
A noticeable feature about Gommațasára is that the Author has always followed the earliest known beacon-lights of Jainism, after Lord Mahavira's Moksha. The most known of these lights is Bhadrabáhu(the 5th shruta-Kevali, 162 A.V., after Vardhamána). He was the preceptor of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta, who became a saint and was called Prabhá Chandra and who renounced the body at Kața vapra Hill, Chandragiri, Shravanabelgula, just in front of the feet of the great Báhubali.
Shri Nemi Chandra also follows the tradition of Shri KundaKundácharya, who flourished in the first century B. C., V. S. 49 (vide Introduction to Panchástikaya S. B. J. Vol. III). As an authority on the learned Jain scriptures, he is next to Shri Gautama Ganadhara, the chief of all saints, who directly received the Discourses of Lord Mahavíra, delivered from his unquivering lips in letterless voice and who expounded the principles of the Jaina religion. Shri Kunda-Kundáchárya has composed among others, the wonderful works on Jaina Metaphysics called Samayasára, Niyamasára, Panchástikáya Samayasára and Pravachana Sára. He also followed the tradition of Umá Swámí, who occupied the pontifical seat, after Shri Kunda Kundá-charya, and gave to the world the Jain Bible, Tatvártha Sútra.

The Author.
The age and the date, etc., of the author Shri Nemichandra Siddhánta Chakravartí need not be repeated here, as they are dealt with at length by the learned Professor S. C. Ghosal, M. A., LL. B., in the first volume of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, entitled Dravya Samgraha. He flourished about 1000 A. D.
Siddhánta Chakravartí.
The saintly author is called the Siddhánta Chakravarti, or the Emperor of Jaina Scriptures.
According to Jaina Geography, a Karma Bhúmí (or region where human beings depend for their livelihood upon work, such as agriculture, etc.,) has six parts: One Arya Khanda or the part peopled by noble, religious and meritorious good people, and 5 Mlechchha Khandas, peopled by the rest of the inhabitants of the Karma Bhúmí. The extreme Northern and Southern Countries, Airávata and Bharata respectively and 32 countries of Videha in the middle of Jambú Dvípa are such Karma Bhúmis. A Chakravarti is the king of the Capital of Arya Khanda of Bharata or Airávata. He advances, and conquers all his neighbours, and by his prowess and piety brings all the 5 Mlechchha Khandas also under him and becomes the sole Emperor of all the six parts of Bharata Kshetra.
Similarly the Jaina scriptures are only an infinite expressed part of the inexpressible all-grasping omniscience, which comprehends all the attributes and all modifications of all substances in all ages, past, present and future, from beginningless time to endless Eternity. A very small account of these Scriptures is given in Jíva Kánda Gáthas 348, etc., seqq.
Sri Nemichandra was the Siddhánta Chakravartí, because he had conquered all the realms of the known knowledge of the Sacred Books. He was called the Emperor because he had like a Chakravarti conquering the six parts of Bharata mastered the famous authoritative works Dhavala, etc., composed by Bhútabali and Pushpadanta, the disciples of Arahatbali some 7 century after Lord Mahávíra which consists of 6 parts called "Jiva Sthána," "Kshudraka Bandha," "Bandha Swámí," "Vedaná khanda," "Varganá-Khanda and "Mahábandha." Gáthá 397 of Karma Kanda may be quoted here. जह चक्केण य चक्की छक्खंड साहियं श्रविग्घेण । AC ALAỀU AU g+ds' atfgå azå || 380 |||
Just as a Chakravartí monarch conquers six parts of the country by his Chakra weapon, so I have mastered the six parts of Dhavala, etc., by my weapon of intellect.

His title is justified by his well-known books, Dravya Samgraha translated as volume I of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, "Gommaṭasára, Jíva Kánda and Karma Kánda, Labdhisára, Kshapanására and the wonderful Trilokasára, a book on Jaina Cosmology, without a study of which it is impossible to understand Jainism in its minute details and classifications or its artistic and perfect solidarity.
His works deal mainly with Karnánuyoga, one of the four Vedas or Anuyogas of the Jaina Siddhánta, called Prathamánuyoga, Karnánuyoga, Charanánuyoga, and Dravyánuyoga.
The Four Anuyogas.
1. Prathamánuyoga, History, the Part dealing with the ages and lives of the Great Personages of the World, specially with those of the 63 Great Persons (Shaláká-Purushas), i. e., the 24 Tírthankaras, the 12 Chakravartís, the 9 Nárayanas, 9 Prati-Nárayanas and the 9 Balabhadras..
2. Karnánuyoga, Cosmology, the Part dealing with Space, the Universe, the Non-Universe, the Three worlds, their description, dimensions and denizens and different calculations as regards spiritual stages and soul-quests.
3. Charanánuyoga, Ritual, the part dealing with rules of conduct for laymen and for ascetics.
Of these the former are detailed in the eleven Pratimás or stages of restraint and renunciation of householders; the latter are the stricter and harder rules of greater and fuller restraint and renunciation for ascetics.
4. Dravyánuyoga, Philosophy, the part dealing with the substances. Primarily the substances are two: Soul and Non-soul. But they are enumerated six, as because the non-soul obviously consists of five independent and distinctly individual substances, Matter, Time, Space and the Media of Motion and Rest. Thus, there are six substances: Soul (Jiva), Matter (Pudgala), Time (Kála), Space (Akásha), Motion (Dharma), and Rest (Adharma).
Matter is of many kinds. But the most mighty kind is Karmic matter, which the mundane soul wears and which is the self-wound motor to keep the soul moving in "Samsára."
This connection of Soul and the Non-Soul matter necessitates a consideration of the inflow of Karma into soul, the bondage of soul by Karma, the stoppage of the inflow, the shedding of the bondage, and perfect freedom of the soul from Karma. These 7 are called the Tattvas or principles of Jainism. They are soul (Jíva), Non-Soul

(Ajíva), Ásrava (Inflow), Bandha (Bondage), samvara (stoppage), Nirjará (Shedding), and Moksha (Liberation).
Omniscience, There is another way of glancing at the subject. As the six Khandas of one Karma Bhúmi, huge as they are (the m of our Bharata Kshetra is about 21 lacs of miles with a length of about 5 crores and 81 lacs of miles), are nothing compared with Space or the universe, even so the works and knowledge of Sri Nemichandra, tremendous though they are, are really nothing in comparison with the whole knowledge, possessed by the Kevali Jina, the Omniscient Conqueror of Karmas.
Yet Shri Gommațasára Jiya Kanda is a good introduction to the Great Tattva, Soul (Jíva). “Know Thyself”, has been the precept and practice of all serious searchers after the truth about Soul. Jainism is an uncompromising apotheosis of knowledge. And in a way in Jainism even Omniscience also is experiential, almost empi. rical. The Soul in Omniscient over flow (Kevala Samudgháta) touches the universe.
This Omniscience again is a negation of Noetics. There is no Science or progression in Omniscience. It is just the seeing of the Whole Truth. It is a full and direct manifestation of the Soul. Knowledge is the essence of soul. There is no soul without knowledge. There is no knowledge or knowability without soul. Nonomniscience is merely a result of the soul being obscured by the conation-obscuring, and knowledge-obscuring (Darshanávarniya and Jnánávarniya) Karmas. These being destroyed, Omniscience, the real Natural characteristic of the Soul manifests itself.
There are infinite souls. Each one has infinite attributes and modifications in Space and Time. It is not easy to classify and analyse and describe them. Less than an Omniscient cannot do it. Less than an Omniscient can follow it only by faith and fragmentarily. Our puny measures of Logic, Science and popular Philosophy are as capable of measuring Omniscience, as our yards and inches are of measuring Space.
There are two ways known to us of having a very rough and remote Idea of Omniscience. One is by considering the exte early Jaina Sacred Literature which is mostly lost to-day; and the other and even a better one is by considering the Jaina theory of numbers. Both subjects are of high value, and immense use, and it is best to consider them here.

Early Jaina Sacred Literature. The knowledge of Shruti, Shruta-Jnána, may be of things which are contained in the Angas (Limbs or sacred books of the Jainas) or of things outside the Angas. There are 64 simple letters of the alphabet. Of these 33 are consonants, 27 vowels, and 4 auxiliary (which help in the formation of compound letters). The total number of possible combinations of these 64 simple letters into compounds of 2, 3, 4, or more up to 64 letters is:
24-1-1,84,46,74,40,73,70,95,51,615. These are the letters (simple and compound) of Shruta in its entirety. This number being divided by 16,348,307,888, which is the number of letters in a central foot (madhyama-pada) of the Paramagama, (Sacred Jaina Literature), gives us the number of padas of the Angas as 11, 283, 58, 005. The remainder 80,108,175, gives us the letters of that part of Shruta which is not contained in the Angas. This part is divided into 14 Prakírnakas.
1.-The Twelve Angas, The Angas are twelve, as follows:
1. The Achára-anga comprises a full exposition of the rules of conduct for ascetics. It contains 18,000 Madhyama Padas.
2. The Sútrakrita-anga comprises a detailed exposition of knowledge, humility, etc., of religious rites and difference between the rites of one's own religion and those of the other one-sided views. It contains 36,000 Madhyama Padas.
3. The Sthána-anga comprises an exposition of one or more sthánas, or numerical points of view in considering Jiva (Soul),Pudgala (Matter) and other Dravyas. While the Jiva-dravya, or soul. is from the point of view of consciousness one and the same everywhere; from the point of view of being liberated (siddha) or mundane (samsárin) it is of two kinds. Similarly, the samsárin, or mundane Jíva, that is, the soul not yet perfectly freed from the bondage of karmas, which keep it moving in the cycle of existences is of three kinds, one sensed, immobile (sthávara), not full-sensed (vikalendriya), and in possession of all the organs of the senses, full-sensed (sakalendriya). The liberated souls too, are of many kinds from the point of view of place, time, etc. This anga contains 42,000 M. padas.
4. The Samaváya-anga gives an account of the similarities that arise from the point of view of Dravya (elements of the universe), Kshetra (place), Kála (time), Bháva (character). From the

The third column of the brief statement of 21 kinds of numbers shows that really there are two unknown :-D. and M. Let us see what they are.
D, or Jaghanya Parítá Asamáhyata. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parítá Asamkhyáta. Let there be four pits each of 1 lac Yojanas in diameter, and
1000 Yojanas deep and called : Anavasthá .... (d') Shaláká
... (BI) Pratishaláká
.. (Y ) Mahashaláká
... (X) Fill d' with round rape-seeds; overfill it from its mouth surface
in a regular conical form, the apex of which is one rape seed; as
The number of seeds in the pit is 197912092999)
680000000000000000 000000000000000
|(31 zeroes).
The number in the cone above 179920084545163
63636363636363631
246 figs.
636363636363636-4 (16 thirty sixes). The total seeds are 1997112938 45 1316363636363636363) 46
636363636363636 4 figs.
Say Z For this filling of di, drop one seed in B1
Then take up the seeds from b , and drop one seed on each of the continents and Oceans beginning with Jambúdvípa. Where the last seed is dropped, it would be an Ocean, (disregard the 411 seed, which will not be in the Cone). Now dig a pit of the diameter of this Ocean, of the same depth, in e., 1000 Yojanas, Call it d2: and fill it in with rape seeds like a topping Cone, as di was filled in. Then drop another rape seed in B for the filling of do.
Then take up the seeds from de and drop one each on the Continents and Oceans beginning with the Continent next to the Ocean where the last seed from di was dropped, whereever in a continent or Ocean the last seed of d? is dropped, take the diameter of that as the diameter of the next pit di which is also 1000 Yoianas deep. Fill it up conically liked and d' . For the filling of ds. drop a third rape seed into B'.
Repeat till Bi is filled in the usual top Conical form. The number of seeds in B1 is =Z; and much larger in each of the pits di to da successively, because their diameters are much larger at each step.

For the filling of B: drop a seed in V. Repeat the same process of dropping one seed on each Continent and Ocean, beginning from the one next to where the last seed from the last Z pit was dropped. The next pit L2 +1 will be 1000 Yojanas deep and with a diameter of the Continent or Ocean where the last seed from the L z pit was dropped. Go on till there are Z pits of the L class with ever-increasing diameter. When the last pit i. e., Lz is exhausted, drop one seed in Y.
Now Y' is also conically filled. Then drop the first seed in X. Repeat till X is also filled. Then the number of L pits will be Z. The number of seeds in the last of these Z3 pits is the number D or Jaghanya Paríta Asamkhyáta. In other words, Dno of rape-seeds in the (Z ) th pit, where Z is 46 figures, ante and where each Continent and Ocean in the width of its ring is double of its immediate predecessor, and never more than only one seed is dropped on each. In other words still. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parítá - Asamkhy Take a pit of the diameter of Jambúdvípa i.e., of 1 lac Yojanas and of 1000 Yojanas depth. Fill it with round rape seeds; over fill it from its mouth surface in a regular conical form, the apex of which
is one rape seed; as 1
... 45 fig.
The number of seeds in the pit is
„ „ „ in the cone above is
... 46 fig.
The total seeds are
... 46 fig.
Say Z. Now there are innumerable Continents & Oceans in the Middle World (Madhya Loka). Each Continent is surrounded by a ring of an Ocean, which in its turn is ringed round by a Continent. Also the width of the ring of each Continent & Ocean is double the width of the ring of its iminediately preceding Ocean and Continent.
Now we take the Z seed out of our first pit, and drop one seed, on each of the Continents and Oceans beginning with Jambú Dvípa. Where the last seed is dropped, it would be an Ocean. Now dig a pit of the diameter of this Ocean. Fill it with rape-seeds in the form of a topping Cone as before.
Take the seeds out of it and proceed to drop one each beginning from the Continent next to the Ocean which gave us the Diameter of this 2nd pit. Then wherever you drop the last seed of this 2nd

pit, take the diameter of that Continent or Ocean for a fresh pit, which is to be filled conically as before and the seeds from which are also to be disposed of as before.
Go on doing this for Z times; The number of seeds in the last i. e. (Z ) th pit is-D.
The imaginary dropping of rape-seeds on the Continents and Oceans serves the purpose of showing.
(1) the tremendous extent of the area of the Middle
World ; (2) the real character of the Jaina Mathematical ideal of
an innumerable number, which although innumerable
is still not infinite; and (3) the tremendous, soul-staggering extent of Omniscience. To find G-Jaghanya Yuktá Asamkhyáta. Take D and virlana it, or spread it into its units; i.e., write down as many ones as there are units in D. On the top of each one, place a D (called Deya). Multiply all together. The product is DD. This is equal to G. This is the number of instants (samayas) in an ávalí or wink. In other words G=DO,
M. or Jaghanya Parítá-Ananta. Now we come to the other great unknown M. To find MJaghanya Parítá Ananta.
Take Jaghanya Asamkhyáta, Asamkhyáta,J.,which is-G' _D2 D
Treat it to the third degree of Shaláká-Virlana-Deya, as below. In Shalá ka Virlana-Deya, there are always three dispositions of the number treated. The first is called Shalá ká. The number is kept in this and is reduced by one at each completion of process in the next two dispositions. The second disposition is called Virlana. In this one is placed in as many places as there are units in the number. The third disposition is Deya. It is the number which is given to be placed on the top of every unit in the Virlana. The first Deya is always the number itself.
Let us treat 3 by this method. We place 3 as Shaláká. We place 3 ones under Virlana ; and the Deya is 3.
In the Virlana on the top of each 1 we place 3. We multiply all these threes and get 3x3x3 - 27. This is the next Deya, Now we reduce the Shaláká by one. So at the second step we have 2 as




Page #37

26
Shaláká ; 27 ones as Virlana; and 27 as Deya. The next Deya would be 2727. Now we reduce the Shaláka by another one. So at the third step we have 1 as as Shaláká ; 2727 ones as Virlana, and 2727 as Deya. The next Deya or the result of
27
37
Virlana is
Now we can reduce the Shaláká by
one more
27
7 27
The process is complete. The result
Let us express it symbolically thus: 2710, which means that 27 is to be written four times, once as a base, then as a power of that base, then as a power of that power and so on.
If we take the last result, i.e. 2710, and treat it by the Shalá ká method as we treated the three above, it would be a two-fold treatment, Thus : take 27 and treat it as Shalá ka, virlana, Deya. Virlana 274 and place on the top of each unit of the Virlana process the number272),multiply all these27) together and now reduce one out of the Shaláká number 2711). The product of this multiplication should be considered as the next Virlana and Deva Virlana this virlana into separate units and place on the top of each unit, the Deya thus obtained. Multiply together all these Deya Then reduce one more from our Shaláká 27177. Consider the product of this second multiplication to be the next virlana and Deya ; Virlana it as before and place on the top of each virlana unit this product and multiply all these Deya together and then again subtract one from our Shaláká
7171; proceed serially in the same way considering the ever and ever increasing new and new product of each multiplication as virlana and Deya; and go on virlaning and multiplying together the new ever-increasing product of the multiplication at each step reducing one at a time from 27,1!, until the whole Shaláká 2714 is totally exhausted ; thus we reach the end of the two-fold treatment. The result of this second treatment also being treated in the Shaláká way will give us the third degree Shaláká treatment of 3 i. e.. the huge product of the multiplication at the end of the second Shaláká treatment should be treated and considered as the new and fresh Shaláká virlana and Deya ; and it should be exhausted exactly as above by successive virlana and Deya, placing Deya on each unit and then multiplying all Deya together and then reducing one from this Shaláká on each multiplication of all the Deya. This is

technically called Shaláká-Traya-Nisthapana. The result of treating J like this is a kind of K. To this result add the following six :1. The innumerable spatial units of the substance of motion (Dharma Dravya).
2. The innumerable spatial units of the substance of Rest (Adharma Dravya).
3. The innumerable spatial units of one soul (ek Jíva Dravya). 4. The innumerable spatial units of the Universe-Space (Lokákácha).
5. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of non-host individual souls (Apratisthita Pratyeka).
6. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units, i.e. the number of host individual souls (Sapratisthita Pratyeka). Take the total of these 7 and treat it to Shaláká-Traya-nisṭhapana as above. The result is again a kind of K. To this add the following four :
1. Instants of one Kalpa or a cycle of Avasarpiní and Utsarpiní (the instants of 20 crore x crore ságaras of years).
2. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of thought-activities of the soul which determine the duration of bondage of Karmas (Sthiti-bandha Adhyavasaya Sthána).
3. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of degrees of passion which determine the intensity, or the mild or strong fruition, of bondage of Karmas (Anubhágabandha-Adhyavasaya Sthána).
4. Innumerable innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of the units of soul's vibratory activities (Avibhaga pratichchheda of Yoga).
Take the total of these five and treat it to Shaláká TrayaNisthapana as above. The result is equal to M.
To find U-Utkrista Ananta-Ananta.
Take S. Treat it to Shaláká-Traya-Nisthápana. The result is a kind of T. To this add the following six :
1. Infinite part of all souls, i.e., the number of liberated souls (Siddhas).
2. Infinite above, i. e. the number of common or groupsouled vegetable (sádhárana vanaspati nigoda) souls (i.e. all the mundane souls, except the earth, water, fire, air, and individual or one-souled vegetable, and mobile souls).

3. Infinite x above, i.e. the number of all vegetable souls
(Vanaspati). 4. Infinite x all souls, i. e. the number of atoms of matter
(Pudgala). 5. Infinite x infinite matter-atoms, i.e., number of instants
in Practical Time (Vyavahára Kála). 6. Infinite xinfinite instants in Practical Time, i. e.; the
number of spatial units in the non-universe space (Aloká
kásha). Take the total of these seven and treat it to shalá ká-TrayaNishthapana. The result is a kind of T. To this add the infinitex the infinite which is the number of units (Avibhága Pratichchheda) of the individuality attribute (Aguru-laghu-guna) in the substances of Motion and Rest (Dharma and Adharma Dravya).
Take the total of these two, and treat it to Shaláká-Traya-Nishthápana. The result is a kind of T.
Subtract this from the number of units (Avibhága Pratichchheda) of perfect knowledge (Kevala Jnána); and then add it to the remainder.
Thus the number of units of perfect knowledge is U.
This last subtraction and addition of the same is to show that even this last kind of T, soul-straining though it is, is nothing compared with U, Omniscience, which is the goal and glory of Jainism, being the highest and the most Ideal condition of the Purest possible soul.
Note that the expression “innumerable x innumerable," and "infinitex infinite” is employed above, because the innumerables and the infinites are not the same. By this time it will be clear that there are a huge number of these innumerables and infinites in the Middle kinds, included in E. H. K. and in N. Q. and T.
(See Triloka Sára Gáthás 9 to 52).

The contents of Gommațasára. This book is really a very brief and hasty glance at the Great Theme, a feeble human effort to give a rough idea of the soul-astounding extent of Divine Ominscience. It confines itself to a short account of Spritual Stages and Soul-quests which are the wellknown Jaina ways of the considering the soul.
Jíva Kánda is only the first part of the great work Gommațasára; the second part being the Karma Kánda. The two Parts together are a brief expansion and explanation of the beautiful little Dravya Samgraha, by the same author. Jivamajivam Davvam (tara ze), the living and the non-living substances are the opening words of (Dravya Samgraha). Gommațasára simply deals with these two mighty categories with the living soul in the Jíva Kánda, and with the non-living Karmic matter in the Karma Kánda.
Dravya Samgraha is the merest enumeration of the topics of Jainism with their main divisions and sub-divisions. It consists 58 Gáthás and 5 Parts. Part I. Substances. The Mundane Soul. Gáthás 1 to 14. „ II. The Non-soul ; Matter; Motion ; Rest; Space; and Time.

Impulse (Sanjná): and (14) Soul-quests (Márganá); also (12 kinds of) Conscious Attentiveness (Upayoga); respectively have been described (in) 20 chapters.
NOTE:--In the 20 chapters, the 14 soul-quests alone form 14 chapters, the others take one chapter each. Gáthá 4 tells us how Soul-classes, Developableness, Vitalities, Rationality and Attention are included in the 14 Quests, and therefore the chief considerations in treating of the soul are,
14 Spiritual stages, the degree to which the mundane soul has
advanced in its freedom from wrong-belief, vowless
ness, negligence, passions and vibratory activity; and 14 Soul-quests, the conditions, circumstances, and equip
ments which help us to identify the soul when we are seeking to mark it in the infinity of mundane exis
tences. These 2 are also interconnected. The stages classify the soul briefly; the quests take them up in greater detail (See Gáthá 3).
The stages are named in Gáthás, 9-10; मिन्छो सासण मिस्सो अविरदसम्मो य देसविरदो य । विरदा पमत्त इदरो अपुच अणियहि सुहमो य ॥ ६॥ उबसंत खीणमोहो सजोगकवलिजिणो अजोगी य । चउदस जीवसमासा कमेण सिद्धा य णादव्वा ॥ १०॥
The English translation is :
Delusion (Mithyátvá); Downfall (Sásádana); mixed (Mishra), and vowless right belief (Avirata Samyaktva), Partial-vow (DeshaVirata); imperfect vow (Pramatta-Virata), the other, perfect vow (Apramatta-Virata), New thought activity (Apúrva Karana), Advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana), slightest Delusion (Súkshma Sámparáya), Subsided-delusion (Upashánta Moha), Delusionless (Kshina Moha), Vibratory omniscient conqueror (Sayoga Kevalí Jina), and non-vibratory omniscient (Ayoga-Kevalí), these 14 should be known to be the spiritual stages (Gunasthána), one after another. After the last, the soul becomes liberated (Siddha).
The Quests are given in Gáthá 142:गइइंदियेसु काये जोगे वेदे कसायणाणे य ।
संजमदंसणलेस्सा भवियासम्मत्तसणिणाहारे ॥ १४२ ॥




Page #43
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The English translation is :
The fourteen-soul-quests are:-1 Conditions of existence(Gati), 2 Sense (Indriya). 3 Embodiment (Káya), 4 Vibratory activity (Yoga), 5 Sex-inclination (Veda), 6 Passion (Kasháya), 7 Knowledge (Jnána) 8 Control (Samyama), 9 Conation (Darshana). 10 Thought-paint (Leshyá), 11 Capacity of Liberation (Bhavya), 12 Right-belief (Samyaktva). 13 Rationality (Samjnitva), and 14 Assimilation of matter (Áhára).
The stages and quests, with their many divisions and sub-divisions, and inter-connections (these are specially treated in the two Appendices, Gáthás 677-734), really exhaust the point of view from which souls in the world may be viewed. Our matter-mad, mammonmad world may blind us to Truth. But the sign-posts on the path to it, though deserted and neglected still shine with their eternal splendour and are unerring guides to the soul who understands itself and cares to tread the hard and lonely but sure path to freedom unending and bliss everlasting. Shri Nemichandra has not erected these sign-posts. He is eager and careful to tell us at each step "The Conqueror has said so" "the All-knowing has described it;" etc. The passions and the cease-less vibrations are the primary and essential cause of stages and these and the operation of other Karmas that of quests. The soul who wants to know itself will soon see its thraldom to the Passion of Anger, Pride, Deciet and Greed, and Sleep and Attachment and their innumerable combinations. Here as everywhere else in Jainism, there is no room for unreasoned faith. If anyone claims this and frightens away the earnest inquirers, it is not the fault of Jainism. It is a gross misunderstanding, and misrepresentation of Jainism. It is fouling one's own nest. True Jainism does not want blind faith. It wants knowledge of Universal principle. Nay, More. It wants realisation and application of this knowledge to the tears and smiles of our neighbours, to the dew and sun on the red rose, to the rainbow on the sky, to the roaring torrents of the Niagara, to the fury of the floods and famines in our Motherland, India, and to the solution of the soul-racking problems of Economics and Politics in Europe and America. No corner of the Universe, no condition of life, no modification in our finest tremor of the mind or soul, no change of form in lifeless matter anywhere nothing is hidden from Jainism. Nothing is exempt from the Sovereign Law of Causation, from the unconquerable Rigour of Karma. The Stages and Quests of the soul here below are entirely due to this. The omniscients of old, the saints, with souls which were purer than the purest ideals concievable by men, and stronger

than adamant in their body and more lustrous in the Light of their souls than the sun or many suns,-these saints saw these Eternal Principles of Life and embodied them in their teachings. These teachings are for all souls high or low, in all ages and in all climes. There is no barrier of casts, creed or colour to their investigation and adoption. The greater part of Jaina literature is still unpublished. Therefore its lustre is not shed all over the world. Therefore the whole of humanity is in the iron-grip of war, of trade-jealousy and trade-deciet, of pain and selfishness, of dejection, disappointment and fear.
Popular Aspect of the Philosophy in the Book.
Evidently in Religion and Philosophy there is no greater concept than Soul ; and in the whole world there is no greater phenomenon than life.
This book throws a flood of light on the question of Living beings as we know them and how they may reach their ideal - Nirvana.
Living man as we see him is obviously a combination of two distinct substances ; Living and Non-living. Let us consider these.
At the outset one marvellous thing is noticeable. We do see purely non-living things, as the pen with which I am writing or the paper which you are reading. But pure life is never met with in the world. So the position really is that we have :
(1) Living substance mixed with non-living substance; and
(2) Non-living substance.
There is non-living matter in both. But in one there is life also; in the other, not.
Vitalities. Another important and useful fact is the fact of death,
It is not annihilation of anything, soul or matter. It is only a separation of the outer body from the soul, which is still combined with two material but fine bodies. It is only when soul obtains
ratoin, that it becomes permanently pure and completely rid of all combination with matter. By careful comparison we can find a trace to the characteristic features of life and its differences from lifelessness.
The first thing we notice in one, who was living but is dead now, is that his senses do not act. He cannot touch, taste, smell, see or hear. He has no vitality of the senses. Also he is powerless. He cannot act, speak or think. He has no force, no vitality of body, speech or mind. But many of these things may be absent

also in a living man who is asleep, in a trance or otherwise unconscious. Therefore all over the world we examine the man's respiration. If it is there, we say, “he still lives." If not, we say "he has breathed his last.” So Spencer speaks of Death as "nought but parting of the breath." Faerie Queene, book 7, canto 7, stanza 46. This respiration is a sure sign of life. It is also popular speech to say of a dead man," he has numbered his days"; "his time has come" etc. Without going into the insoluble mysteries of metaphysics, in the above common observations, which may be made anywhere and at any time and by anyone, we have the surest and most self-evident distinction between living and lifeless objects. If we can believe in the testimony of our own immediate observation, confirmed by the fact that the experience of every other thinking being is exactly the same, we must sum up the distinction between living and non-living substances thus. A non-living substance does not have,
(1) The Vitality of the 5 senses ; (2) The Power of body, speech and mind ; (3) Respiration; and
(4) Age.
These four may be called the four (or with their sub-divisions ten) vitalities of living beings.
But it is noticeable that all these four or ten are also a manifestation of one underlying real fact; viz. that of consciousness. In a dead body the sense-organs are there and the eye may be impressed with colour and form as before, but there is no consciousness behind it which in life received, and recorded, and responded to the Ocular stimulus. The four or ten Vitalities are sure signs to dtstinguish the living from the non-living ; but in reality it is consciousness which distinguishes life from lifelessness.
Too much and too careful thought cannot be given to this Consciousness. If we do not understand it, we shall wander from the truth. Let us, therefore, try to gain further insight into this consciousness.
Consciousness. Attention. Knowledge. We often pass through a street without seeing or hearing things which are present before the eye and the ear. A man spoke; but we say, "I am sorry, I did not hear him.” The speech was there: the sound waves impinged on the ear and yet we did not hear. Why ? simply because we were absorbed otherwise. We were not. ie.. our consciousness was not, attentive to it. This Attentiveness

of consciousness is another great distinction between the living and the lifeless. This attentiveness, of course, will be of as many different sorts as there are activities of the senses, mind and the soul, of which we can be conscious. We can be conscious of an object of sight, or of the other four senses ; or of the soul itself directed to a material object or to its own Omniscience. Thus our Attention also may be directed towards an ocular, or non-ocular object, or towards the soul directly knowing a material object or full of its own Omniscience.
Notice also, that of necessity, this Attention is essential to any kind of Knowledge. As a matter of fact, if we subject any piece of our knowledge to deep analysis we can note the following stages.
1. To begin with there is consciousness itself. This is the centre of life. It is life itself. It is the first and unmistakeable characteristic of what is called soul.
2. It must be Attentive to conate an object, i.e., to be inclined towards an object, i.e., to be merely turned towards it.
3. It must conate the object, i.e., it must be aware that some object is present there, without determining anything more about in the least.
4. Then it must attend to know that object in however slight a detail. This is the Attentiveness which must proceed knowledge.
• 5. Then a detail is grasped and knowledge begins, when we know a thing, we are not conscious of these 5 steps. But since our birth we are so much habituated to gain knowledge by means of our senses and mind, that these 5 steps are a sort of reflex or automatic, unconscious action of our busy consciousness. When we walk even for miles, or see with our eyes, or wink or breathe, or our blood courses in the body-we are seldom conscious of any of these things. They are familiar, habituated, and reflex or unconcious actions, and therefore unobserved. But their stages are all the same there. The alternate balancing of the whole body on one foot, th bending forward, then balancing on the other and so on; the closing of the eyelid to protect the eye; the inhalation of air to supply the lungs with oxygen, the exhalation to put forth foul carbonic acid gas, etc., each little action with its minute process and delicate machinery is going on without our attending to it, consciously. Infinitely, more delicate and unobserved are the myriad th our mind, which we call our channel of knowledge Only an Omniscient can see the millions of regular, natural processes by which the smallest particle of knowledge is called into being. Familiarity

has bred indifference amounting to ignorance in us. This psychic factory is within our own bodies.
Take an example :- 1. You are reading these words before your eyes, if you are dead and unconscious you can never read the words although they are before your eyes. There is no consciousness there. To be able to read you must have consciousness
If your thoughts are away, e.g. a siren song from your neighbour fascinates you and you are all ear to it. You cannot read these words, for your consciousness is not Attentive to the words. So attention is needed.
3. When your attention is drawn to the words in the first instance, there is merely a conation of them. You are merely conscious that something, not words, but merely something is there. This is conation (Darshana). This precedes knowledge. But it is most difficult to detect it or to describe it. It is itself an indescribable stage of consciousness touching a knowable object. It is merely a sort of is-ness of something of which your attentive consciousness is aware. It is not knowledge; nor even the beginning of knowledge. It is merely a preliminary, but a necessary prelimi. nary, to knowledge.
4. After this conation by attentive consciousness, the consciousness is directed to know the thing. The first instant witnesses the Attention of the consciousness shifted from conation to knowled This attentiveness is the beginning of knowledge. After this, knowledge begins. These stages are exceedingly difficult to analyse. Very profound, patient and long practised self-analysis is needed to perfectly verify them. But they are there. They may be sensed satisfactorily by any one who gives sober, serious and staid thought to the grasping of them.
From being aware of the mere is-ness of something in the paper before you, you instantly are conscious that there are some sort of letters there. Your mind questions? What kind of letters ?
The next instant answers: letters of the English Alphabet. You impress this on your mind and record and retain it there for future use. This is useful to you on future occasions. You may remember it, you may recognise it by seeing these very words again or by seeing some others similar or dissimilar to them. You may collect together many records like this and build up an induction on the basis of them. From your induction you may deduce inferences.

From all the above knowledge about the words you are reading, you may lead yourself on to a knowledge of something else which is not in the words themselves. So from the mere sense of having seen the words, i. e. from a merely sensitive knowledge about them you may go on to think that they are philosophical symbols and exclaim with Milton:--
"How charming is divine philosophy,
Nor harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose, But musical as is Apollo's lute,
And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets, Where no crude surfeit reigns". Comus 11,476-480.
If you analyse your experience about these words you will easily perceive no less than thirteen distinct stages in it. 1. Consciousness (Chetaná). 2. Attention (Upa-yoga) of this consciousness towards the conating (Darshana) of these words. 3. Conation (Darshana) itself i.e. the awareness that something is there, 4. Attention (Upa-yoga) of consciousness to know (Jnána) and to see. 5. Actual sight, (Avagraha) the preception that there is something like words there. 6. The desire (íhá) to know further the question what letters are these. They seem to be English. It is the process through which mere preception is transmuted into judgment; it is the conception and comparison or pre-judgment or ratiocination. 7. The judgment, (Aváya), The answer; they are English letters. The retention (Dharaná), the fixing of the judgment in the mind. 9. The memory (Smriti) of the words. 10. Their recognition (sanjná). 11. The Induction (chintá) from them. 12. The deduction( Abhinibodha) and 13. The Scriptural knowledge (Shruta) i. e. the extra knowledge of other things derived through the sight of the script of the letters.
It is easy to see that the first four are pre-knowledge stages; and the next eight from 5th to 12th are stages of degrees of sensitive knowledge, and the last is inferential knowledge, which may be termed Scriptural knowledge.
Consciousness may further know things directly without the intermediation of the senses or the mind. The soul itself may visualise matter directly or may visualise the impressions about it in the mind of another. This kind of knowledge is very rare and can be understood only after great profound study and longlived life of controlled discipline and purity. Still more difficult to understand is Omniscience. I shall try to take the reader up to it gradually, provided he is patient and dispassionately in search of Truth, and

not in the hurry to criticise, or dogmatise, to say "What is Truth,'' and then Pilate-like to go away,
8 kinds of knowledge. One thing I may here say, although it is obvious that Sensitive and Scriptural knowledge may go wrong. Even Visual knowledge (direct vision of matter by the soul) may go wrong but direct Mental knowledge of the mind of others and Perfect knowledge or Omniscience cannot go wrong. Thus we may be said to have come to 8 kinds of knowledge; five right and the first three wrong also.
These are the first batch of considerations of the great fact of consciousness in living matter. And we must remember that each kind of conscious activity has its preliminary Attentiveness.
Thus we may sum up. Consciousness is Attentiveness of Conation or of Knowledge, or Conation or Knowledge itself. Conation is for Ocular, (Chakshu), Non-ocular (Achakshu), Visual (Avadhi), or Perfect (kevala) Knowledge.
Knowledge is Sensitive( Mati),Scriptural(Shruta),Visual( Avadhi), Mental(Manah Paryaya) or Perfect (Kevala), also wrong Sensitive (Ku-Mati), wrong Scriptural (Ku-Shruta), and wrong Visual(KuAvadhi)Knowledge.
Let us illustrate again. Consciousness which is the mighty, real characterstic of life is the starting point. You must be alive to read these words. You must be attentive to feel that something is there. You must conate these words. Then again you must be attentive to perceive, then alone you begin to know them, i.e. have perception, conception, judgment, retention, memory, recognition, induction, or deduction from them.
Roughly it may be said that attentiveness for conation or knowledge of any kind is the first instant of conation or knowledge. As the name implies it is the instant in which consciousness attends to conate or know an object. Also obviously conation is a necessary preliminary to knowledge.
Consciousness is the most essential difference between the Living and Non-Living. It deservedly detained us for a moment. But we must attend once more to a distinction between the two mighty categories, the Living and the Non-living Substances.
We have seen that the first distinction is that the Living has and the Non-living does not have the four or ten vitalities of the five senses; the power of mind, speech and body; respiration ; and age. We found the second distinction to be attentiveness of consciousness to four kinds of conation, Ocular, Non-ocular, Visual and Perfect; and to eight kinds of knowledge, Sensitive, Scriptural,

and Visual of the right as well as wrong, Mental and Perfect, of the right (kind only.)
The Soul and the Body. We also saw that although Non-living substance is found in fair abundance around us, living substance always seems to be mixed up with non-living matter in the world. Popular phraseology teaches us to call this non-living sheath of the living consciousness, its “body”. “One body, one soul ” seems to be the general motto of the universe. There are exceptions, but they need not detain us here. Botanical and other Scientific researches have taught us the learning of parasits and their hosts; so one body becomes the lodging of many souls. But to stick to popular parlance, one unified, individual consciousness forms the ego or soul or “I” and it fills one body. The crudest observation shows that this consciousness has the capacity of completely filling the size of its particular body. The elephant has a conscious individual soul ; so has an ant. So we may note as the third distinction between life and lifeless matter that life has the capacity of completely filling its lifeless sheath with consciousness, or in other words, or being coextensive with its body.
Notice also that the same grows fat on high living, or grows thin by disease. Indeed the little new-born baby becomes a big boy, then a bigger powerful man, and then a weak, emaciated old man; yet all through, the same one individual consciousness completely fills the body in its different sizes. The soul is capable of contraction and expansion.
The Soul Arts and Enjoys. Look at the living-non-living mixture from another point of view. We attribute activity and enjoyment to it. We say of a man's act: What a good or bad thing he has done. When a man acts without restraint or rashly and comes to grief, we say: this is the fruit of his folly." If a man is good, and prosperous, we say: "Oh! he does deserve it all and more.” These popular phrases really have a philosophical significance. They attribute responsibility and reward to our consciousness. They imply that this consciousness is an active, responsible agent; is the Doer of all actions; and is the Enjoyer of the fruits of these actions, good or bad.
It is necessary to remember these, lest we should fall into the error of exempting the soul, ego or individual consciousness from all responsibility for his actions, good or bad, and thus at one stroke uproot all ethical distinctions and fullstop to discriminate actions.




Page #51

We must also draw a distinction between the actions and the inner activity, to which these external actions are due. From the practical point of view we must emphasise the external actions, and from the real point of view their causes in the inner activity of our consciousness. But the responsible agent of both these is the individual consciousness itself.
Consciousness is as such purely itself, i.e. quite separate from matter which is unconscious, lifeless. From this pure or real point of view, we may say that all action and enjoyment of the soul is within its own consciousness.
The Soul is Immaterial.
Once more let us compare our categories, the Living and Nonliving. The most obvious form of non-living substance is matter; as iron, dry wood, sapphire, stone wall, key of our lock, our table, chair and innumerable other objects conveniently handy for this investigation to anyone at all times and at all places. That is the chief characterstic of this mass of matter of so many kinds? It is obviously this: It can be known by the senses. It has colour; we can see that coal is black; sapphire is blue; gold is yellow, ruby is red; and snow is white.
Again if we taste various kinds of matter we find that pepper is pungent, that aloes is bitter, that salt is saline, that the juice of an unripe mango is acid, and that sugar is sweet. Again rose essence smells sweet, Sulphur does not smell nice. Also, iron is cold, dry wood is not compared with iron; silk is smooth; sand is rough; cotton is soft; stone is hard; a feather is light and lead is heavy. We can sum up these 5 colours, five tastes, two smells and eight touches as the more obvious characteristics of lifeless matter. None of these twenty is found to characterise Consciousness, or pure life. Of course when life is mixed with non-living matter, it assumes all these distinctions of colour, taste, smell, and touch. Thus embodied consciousness does have colour, taste, etc. Soul is not matter. Byron rightly said that is the matter never mind him what is the mind, no matter. By "mind" we must mean the taking Ego, the soul.
Possibility of Omniscience.
This point is radical and deserves a little more consideration. Above we have seen vitalities, attention, conation, knowledge, doing and enjoying, and co-extension with the body to be the observed characteristics of the living substance. Here we may pause for a moment to consider these characteristics also. They were all

derived from our observation of a dead corpse and a living reader of these words. In the corpse, we simply noted the absence of the living and thus indirectly inferred that what was absent, belonged to and was taken away by the living substance when it left the corpse lifeless. The living reader gave us mostly the psychic stages of conation and knowledge. But in all these we are not able to study or observe pure life. Indeed it must be confessed frankly that there is absolutely no means at present of our studying life or soul directly and fully in its pure condition without any admixture of matter in it. We are in the world. There is no pure soul in this world of ours. All are embodied or mundane souls. In studying them, except in abstract thought, we cannot separate the living soul from its sheath of non-living matter, i. e., the body. But the living embodied soul also can exhibit in the world such a high degree of manifestation of pure life and independence of nonliving matter, that we can form a very near idea, of a pure perfect soul. As we approach that idea we find that vitalities, and responsibility for doing and enjoying shrink more and more; and that conation and knowledge correspondingly increase in purity, extent, depth and fineness. From this it is justifiable to conclude that the ultimate idea of a perfect soul, i.e., the ideal soul will be identical with an individual consciousness which has perfect conation and perfect knowledge with their attendant perfect power and perfect bliss. Also that this stage must mean total separation or liberation from matter. Thus alone from a consideration of the obvious categories, of the living substance and non-living substance, gradually, and after very deep, persistent, patient, difficult, and long study and contemplation we can arrive at a conception of a Pure Soul, the Highest Self, the Ideal, God, or whatever other name you like.
Living substance rises higher and higher towards the condition of matterless living, and ultimately, when perfectly rid of matter, it attains an eternal condition of Pure Light in Self-Absorption and by nature ascends upwards to the top of universe.
There is no turning back, and no further bondage with matter, and no transmigrations. Its modifications there, consist of its own perpetual self-modification. It has perfect conation and perfect knowledge. It is itself. It is liberated. It is Pure Soul.
But excepting this condition of absolute purity, the soul's own pure qualities are effected by those of matter. So we find that attention, conation and knowledge, which are pure consciousness or its modifications, are observed in a mundane or embodied soul, to

exist along with vitalities, and the size of the body, and are responsible for sowing and reaping the fruit of action, which are the characteristics of the living being united with the non-living matter and with touch, taste, smell and colour the pure characterstics of non-living matter.
The whole picturesque and endless variety of life, - physical, mental and emotional life in the universe is the effect and summation of infinite ways in which the Living unites with the Nonliving.
Let us try to consider this glorious wealth of variegated life of souls in the universe. The whole universe is packed full of living creatures. Indeed in such out-of-the-way and unexpected places, does our knowing intelligence light upon life, that some Great Intellects have gone the length of saying that all is Life and there is no lifeless matter at all. This of course is easily refuted by common, everybody, universal observation. In comprehending the almost incomprehensible vastnesses of space and time and their contents let us keep a cool and dispassionate head lest in our admiration of one or other of the several constituents of the universe, we should deny one or more and thus cripple our further and full knowledge of the whole truth of things. Indeed the checking of our premises and first conclusions again and again is absolutely essential if we, imperfect human beings, want to gain right knowledge. The search after Truth is not a child's play: the path to it is more narrow to traverse than the passage of the camel through the eye of the needle in the Bible.
The universe, then, teems with infinite living forms. How to observe, analyse, and classify them, so that we can advance on the path of our tremendous, trackless inquiry?
I propose to take this matter up in three different ways.
1. Souls classes (Jíva Samása). There are obvious differences of body, sense and mind in different classes of souls: The body is primarily the basis of this classification. This in Jainism is technically called soul-classes. (Jíva Samása).
2. Soul-quest (Márganá). It comprises other inner differences in species, sex, passion, knowledge, conation etc., - In soul-quest, the embodied condition of the soul, (i.e.) the mixed living and nonliving condition is primarily the basis.
3. Spiritual Stages (Gunasthana). They concern the purelyinner progress of the soul. In these spiritual stages, the progress of the soul from ignorance and delusion to perfect self-absorption is traced.

1. Jiva Samasa-Soul-classes. From the protoplasm of the germ-cell to a full-blown human being, there is an infinite number of mundane souls or living beings in the universe. The protoplasm so far as is known at present, has no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no nose to smell, no tongue to taste ; it has only the sense of touch. The human being has all the five senses fully developed and distinct, and a mind also which is also a sort of additional and higher sense (a quasi-sense), the organ of which sense is invisible to us. In Jainism, it is an organ which is made up of subtle matter called Manovarganá, or mental matter. Its form is like a lotus with eight petals near the heart. Dr. Robert Bell has long held the theory that the solar plexus is the real centre of mental activity. Professor Troude and eminent war-surgeons dispute the brain as the seat of mental activity. In war time operations, brains were removed without impairing the mental faculties. (The Leader, November 12, 1920, page 7, Col. 3).
Thus we can divide mundane souls into 6 classes :1 With the sense of touch only
fine. , & taste
gross. » » » & smell
& sight ... "
& hearing ,
„ „ „ & mind , Fine-one sensed souls cannot be known by our senses. They can penetrate all matter. They are everywhere in the universe. They are not obstructed by, and they do not obstruct others. They die their own death.
Some of the above 7 kinds are born with the capacity to develop, others die before acquiring the capacity to develop. Each one of the 7 may therefore be developable or non-developable. Thus there may be said to be 14 soul-classes in all.
Here another distinction may be considered. Some mundane souls when attacked or in fear of something or some-one, can voluntarily change their place in space. A man attacked with a sword or by a lion can run away from the lion or his assailant. So a dog, cat, pigeon, butterfly, maggot, or the finest animalculce which we can see, runs away from the vicinity of danger and death. It is merely a paraphrase of the universal instinct of self-preservation.
But it is evident that a blade of grass, a huge oak, or banyan or a stone growing in a quarry cannot run away before the scythe, axe, or spade which threatens to put an end to its life. This capa

city to be able to take one's body from one place to another divides souls in the universe into Immobiles, like stones in quarry, vegetables, trees, etc., and mobiles like men, animals, birds, etc.
Observation will show that all one-sensed souls are immobile, incapable of voluntary change of place; and that all the other souls are mobile, who can at will run away from danger or death.
The classes are said to be 14 in Gátha 72 : 57 ir Gáthá 73: 98 in Gáthá 79 and 80 ; and 570 in Gáthá 78. But we can classify them into 406 soul-classes, also, as below:

The following points as to the soul-Classes may be explained for the reader who is not familiar with the technicalities of Jainism.
NIGODA (VEGETABLE) KINGDOM. Sádhárana, or Common, or Group-Souled Vegetables.
The Universe is 14 Rajus high, 7 Rajus at the base, with a thickness which at the base is 7 Rajus, then gradually decreases to one Raju at a height of 7 Rajus, i.e. at the Middle of the Universe, where the Middle World, i.e. the region of the human and subhuman beings, is situated. Then it gradually grows to a thickness of 5 Rajus at the point where the sixth Heaven ends, and which marks the Middle of the Upper World, or the region of Heavenly beings; finally it gradually decreases to a thickness of one Raju at the top of the Universe, i.e., 14 Rajus high above the base, 7 Rajus high above the Middle World, and 3) Rajus high above the sixth Heaven. It is here, that the Siddha Kshetra, or the Region of the eternally liberated Souls is situated. This is at the top of the Universe. (See Map at the end of this Introduction).
“Nigoda" beings are of two kinds, fine and gross. Fine Nigoda Living beings exist everywhere in the Universe, from the nethermost hell to the highest region of the eternally liberated souls. They are one-sensed, both developable and undevelopable, take birth and die 18 times in the short interval of time taken by one pulse-beat of an average human being. Of course, being souls, they have knowledge, but this knowledge, preceded by its conation, is limited to the sense of touch. These Nigoda souls are neither earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, nor air-bodied. They belong to the vegetable sub-classes of the Immobile class of souls : They have one body, occupied by many souls which are born, which live, and which die together.
These group-souls are of two kinds :
(1) Those who have never left Nigoda. These are called Nitya Nigoda, ever-one-body-many-souled.
(2) Those who left Nigoda and became embodied in higher forms of soul-classes, but have come down to Nigoda once more. These are called Itara Nigoda, or Chaturgati Nigoda. One-body many-souled.
These two are also called Sádhárana, or “Common” or GroupSoul-classes of vegetables.
Pratyeka or Individual-Souled Vegetables. Other vegetables have one body and one soul only. They are called individual-souled or Individual(Pratyeka)vegetables. These are always gross, and never fine. But these again may or may not have parasites or hosts. Thus there are 2 kinds :
(1) Sapratishthita, or Host-one-souled vegetables. (2) Apratishthita, or Non-host-one-souled vegetables.

Each one of these two, being either a Trunk, Creeper, Plant, Tree, or Root, there are 10 classes of these individual-souled-vegetables, so-called in contrast to common or group-souled vegetables. Bhoga-Bhumi (Enjoyment Region).
The Jaina conception of the Middle World is that it is entirely confined to the one Raju square of the layer of the Mobile Channel (Trasa Nadi), at a height of 7 Rajus from the base of the Universe.
This Middle World consists of concentric rings of successive Continents and Oceans. Each succeeding ring has a width double of the ring-width of its predecessor. In the centre of the Middle World there is the first Continent Jambudvipa, of a diameter of one lac (1,00,000) Yojanas. It has in its centre the Sumeru mountain, which has a height of 1,00,040 Yojanas, 40 Yojanas of which form the top, and 1,000 Yojanas of which are embedded in the earth as the sub terranean foundation of the Mountain, and which has a circular base of the diameter of 10,000 Yojanas.
The Ocean, Lavana, next to Jambúdvipa and encircling it all round is a ring with a width of 2 lac Yojanas. The next Dhátu ki Khanda, is a continent, a ring with a width of 4 lac Yojanas. The next Kálodadhi is the Second Ocean with a ring-width of 8 lac Yojanas. The next Pushkaravara Dvípa, is the third Continent with a ring-width or 16 lac Yojanas. And so on, till through innumerable Continents and Oceans we reach the last pair of rings, the the Svyambhú Ramana Ocean. This is the last ring of water holding our Middle World in its embrace.
It is to be noted that the third Continent Pushkara-Vara-Dvípa has a circular mountain bisecting it equally throughout the width of its ring. This mountain is called Mánushottara, Cis-human, as there are no human beings beyond its limits nor can any human beings go beyond its limits. Thus the human regions are a circle of 45 lacs of Yojanas, and comprise the first two oceans and the first two and a half Continents.
It is noticeable that in Jainism there are 5 regions, each with a diameter of 45 lacs of Yojnas.
(1) The above human region is called the 2 Dvipas.
(2) As Nirvána is attained only from the human regions, the Siddha Kshetra at the top of the Universe also is a region with a diameter of 45 lac Yojanas.
(3) So is Siddha Shilá, the earth below the Siddha Kshetra. (4) The first Indraka-Vimána or central celestial Car or residence, just one hair's breadth above the apex of Sumeru.

(5) The first Indraka Bila or Central hellish hole or resid.
ence of the denizens of hell in the first layer of hell, one
lac Yojanas below our earth. It is also interesting to note that there are 3 regions with a diameter of 1 lac Yojanas, and 2 regions with a height and thickness of the same extent respectively,
(1) Jambúdvípa, the first Continent in the centre of the
middle World. (2) The last Indraka Vimána or central celestial Car or
residence in Sarvártha Siddhi in the last or 3rd layer of
the Upper World. (3) The last Indraka Bila, or Central hellish hole, or residence
of the denizens of hell in the last or 49th layer of hell in
the seventh earth in the Lower World. (4) The height of Mount Sumeru minus its top of 40 Yojanas. (5) The thickness of the first Earth from its crust at the
Middle World down to the end of the second part ; Panka Bhága, i. e., just before the beginning of the first layer
of the first hell is also 1 lac Yojanas. Now the Central or first Continent, Jambú Dvípa, has a diameter of one lac Yojanas. This is divided into 7 Countries (Kshetra) each separated from the other by a mountain (Kuláchala). Thus we have 7 countries and 6 mountains. The first is a Country; the second, a mountain and so on. Each succeeding division has double the width of its predecessor, till we reach Videha, the central region round Sumeru, from where the width begins to be half of its predecessor. Thus arithmetically the divisions are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, 32,16,8,4,2,1, a total of 190 units. The countries in the extreme north and south being each of one unit have a width of one lac Yojanas divided by 190 i.e. 526. great Yojanas.
The second, third and fourth Countries have respectively 4, 16, and 64, units of width; as also the corresponding countries in the North, counting North to South, i,e, in each case from Lavaná Ocean to Mount Sumeru.
In these 3 pairs of Countries there are the three Bhog Bhumis or Enjoyment-Lands, being the Lowest (Jaghanya), Middle (Madhyama), and the Highest (Utama) Bhoga-Bhúmis, respectively.
In Videha, however, the Eastern and Western Countries, beyond the Eastern and Western Limits of the Bhadra Shála forest, are Karma Bhumi. The rest alone, i.e. the region immediately round Sumeru is the Highest Bhoga Bhumi. The region in the North

is called Uttara Kuru, that in the South Deva Kuru, Bhoga Bhumi.
In 32 countries of Videha, and in the rest of the Continent there is Karma Bhumi or Work-Region, where people have to depend on agriculture etc. for their living. In Enjoyment Region, they have no work to do, they get all that they want from Kalpa Vrikshas, wishing-trees, never have disease or accidents, and live the full span of their lives. The least happiness of a man in Bhoga Bhumi is infinite times the happiness of a Chakravarti.
It is very significant that the islanders of Java have a word in their language denoting an Enjoyment-Land. Is it that the Jaina missionaries and colonists penetrated into these islands, centuries and centuries ago, and left the tradition of their Bhoga-Bhumi there? Kubhoga-Bhumi (Distorted or Improper
Enjoyment-Region). In the Lavana Ocean, round Jambudvípa, and in Kalodadhi round Dhatu ki Khanda, there are 96 islands; 48 in each, 24 on each shore of the Ocean. They are inhabited by ill formed persons (kumanushya) with disproportionate (hundaka) bodies. All of them have an age of one Palya. These people also do not have any agriculture etc. and live, some on mud and some on fruits. They have no Wishing-trees. As they have no arts of agriculture etc., they are called people of Bhoga Bhumi, but as their life is low and savage-like and their forms improper and distorted, the land is called Ku-Bhoga Bhúmi or wrong, distorted or improper Enjoyment-Land.
Paryápti (Developableness). The Chapter on Paryápti (Developableness) in Jainism is interesting, but not free from intricacy. It is dealt with in Jiva Kanda Chapter III Gathás 118-128; and is followed by an account of prána (Vitality) in Chapter IV (Gáthás) 129-133. Biologists and Zoologists alone can say if it is capable of being subjected to experiments. But the briefest Jaina account is this. The newly born soul is incomplete, but has the capacity to become complete, in assimilation, body, senses, respiration, speech, and mind. The comple: tion of the capacity to develop these 6 assimilation etc., makes the 6 Paryaptis. When a soul goes from one condition of existen another, it assimilates the molecules of áháraka matter, and also of speech matter in the case of more than one-sensed, and of mindmatter in the case of rational beings. The áháraka molecules form the physical body of human and sub-human beings, the fluid (Vaik

riyaka, transformable) body of celestial and hellish beings, and the assimilative body in case of saints. These molecules must be reduced to a primary solid and liquid form. The completion of the capacity to do it is the Assimilative (Áháraka) Development. The solid portions develop into bone etc., hard substances, and the liquid into blood, bile etc. the fluid substances of the body. The completion of the capacity to do it, is the body (Sharira) Development. The molecular matter assimilated by the soul is further formed into senseorgans, the completion of the capacity to do it is the sense (Indriya) Development. The wear and tear of the body is made up by ceaseless Respiration. The completion of the capacity for respiration is the Ana-pána-Development. The completion of the capacity to form speech-molecules and mind-molecules into speech and mind, is respectively the speech and mind Development.
The beginning of the acquiring of 4, 5 or 6 capacities is simultaneous; but their completion is in the order in which they are named above. And from the first kind each successive development takes more time to complete itself than its predecessor. But each one individually, and all the 6 collectively never take more than one (Antara muhúrta, the minimum of which is one wink (Ávalí) and one instant (Samaya), and maximum is 48 minutes minus one instant.
But a completely undevelopable (Labdhi-aparyáptaka) soul does not complete its capacities to develop, and dies within one antar-muhúrta, which is one eighteenth of one pulse-beat.
The Nuclei (Yonis).
The Yoni is the womb or other physical centre or nucleus where the incarnating soul find its lodgment at conception. According to Jainism, such a nucleus may be cold, hot, covered or open, living or non-living, or a combination of these 3 pairs. Thus primarily yonis are of 9 kinds.
But with their classes and sub-classes they are 84 lacs. The 84 lacs of nuclei for birth of souls are as follows:One-Sensed beings:
Earth-bodied
Water-bodied
Fire-bodied
Air-bodied
Vegetables
Non-one-souled.

Ever-one-body-many-souled Other-one-body-many-souled

Total ... 84,00,000 II.--Márganá (Soul-Quest). In what different ways we search for a mundane soul? We can do so in no less than 14 different ways.
1. Four conditions of Existence (Gati).
We may see whether it is a human, or a sub-human soul on earth; or it is a non-human soul above or under the earth. These latter are the celestial and hellish beings. All ancient systems of thought posited their existence. We cannot see them today. But there is nothing inherently impossible in the conception of these forms of living beings, who live, think, and feel and can change their bodies at will, as described by Milton in his “Paradise Lost." This Quest may be called Condition of Existence (Gati).
2.-Five Senses (Indriya). The 5 senses give us another kind of Quest, called the SenseQuest.
3.-Six Embodiments (Káya). The different kinds of embodiments of immobile and mobile souls furnish another kind of Quest. It is open to observation that the body of a vegetable and the body of a man are radically different. Ultimately as matter, they may be, and are the same. But their difference is equally marked. Their constitution and composition are different. Their Chemical characteristics vary. They occupy obviously different places in the whole range of living beings. It is on this basis that people are split up into vegetarians and non-Vegetarians. Vegetarians give up taking lives higher than non-vegetables, because animals are more evolved and their bodies approximate our own bodies more than the bodies of vegetables do.

Non-injury (Ahímsá).
I may be allowed to digress here. Live and let live is as simple a motto of life as it is Profound. No one has a right to destroy any life. Every one has a right to live.
Now the curious thing is that Life thrives on life. No living being can continue its life without another life being destroyed. How to reconcile these two facts: the duty of not-taking another's life and the right of preserving one's own, which necessitates destruction of other life? The reconciliation can be effected by interpreting these two sister precepts in a possible practical way, and not in an impossible Antinomian fashion.
"The ideal practice of non-injury is possible only to the soul in its perfect condition, i. e. when it has freed itself from the last particle of matter (Karma Varganás). On this side of that happy state, do whatever we will, some life must be transformed into our life in order to sustain it. Therefore what is meant and enjoined is simply this, "Do not destroy life, unless it is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a higher kind of life." The purer souls will, of course, not like to sanction even this. But as formulated above, the rule does not sanction hurting or injury: it limits it to the lowest possible minimum. As a supplementary rule we have: "And then begin with the least evolved kind of life, for example, with the sthavars (immobiles)." (See Outlines of Jainism p. 71).
Destruction of any one or more of the 10 vitalities is injury. The extent of injury varies with the number of vitalities injured Immobiles possess four, the least number of vitalities. Mobiles have from 6 to 10 vitalities.
In the soul-classes above we found souls to be mobile or immobile. The immobiles are one-sensed beings and have for their bodies vegetables, air, fire, water or earth. Science every day is making progress in discovering these tiny and ultra-microscopic fellowbeings of ours. Plants are credited with conscious life now. Much that was considered inorganic is found in the light of greater knowledge to be organic. Air and fire, water and earth, are the bodies of innumerable living beings. From this point of view we can search a soul in 6 kinds of embodiment; earth, water, fire, air, vegetable and mobile.
4.- Fifteen Vibratory Activities (Yoga).
4. All activity of the body, speech, and mind is the cause of the inner modifications or vibrations of life or our vital consciousness. Thus our mundane life is continued. An angry thought, a noble




Page #65
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

impulse, the passion of patriotism, and infinity of movements of body, speech and mind produce almost visible changes in matter. There is a constant circulation, action, and reaction between these outward acts and the inner consciousness-vibrations, of which the external vibrations are the cause.
Our speech, or thoughts may be true or false, a mixture of both or neither. This gives us eight kinds. Our body has several inter-penetrating sheaths of the outer body, electric and the karmic body. Their activity can be distinguished in no less than 7 ways. Thus the Vibration-Quest gives us 15 main kinds (for details see Gatha 216 et seq.
5.-Three sex-inclinations. (Veda). Every soul has the instinct of propagation. Life reproduces itself. This is due to sex-impulse. This takes three wel forms, male, female, or common. We can search soul in these three sex distinctions.
6.-The 25 Passions. (Kashaya). As soon as we take up any manifestation of the consciousness, volition of a soul, we can easily trace it to some passion or other in the consciousness. If we observe and analyse many of these manifestations, we find that they are due to the four passions of Anger, Pride, Deceit, and Greed, or their combinations. Again it is noticeable that there are innumerable degrees of each one of these passions. Take Anger. It may be so intense as to blind one and to last a long, long time. It may possess one in an extreme and erroneous form. It may only mean a loss of all restraint. It may prevent only partial restraint. Or it may be a transient feeling, which may disturb the perfect equanimity of the soul for a moment. From these four broad degrees, we may say the four passions to be of 16 kinds. Other minor passions are also noticeable (e. g.) laughter (hásya), indulgence (rati), ennui (arati), sorrow (shoka), fear (bhaya), disgust (jugupsá) and the masculine, feminine and common sex inclinations. This Quest may be called the Passion-Quest.
7.-Eight Quests of Knowledge (Jnána). Knowledge has been considered above in its five right kinds of sensitive, scriptural, visual, mental, and perfect ; and three wrong kinds of sensitive, scriptural and visual. These 8 kinds give the 8 Quests of Knowledge.
8.--Six controls (Sanyama). Some souls have no control at all. Others have some sort of part control, part non-control. Some have more control than




Page #66
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

55
others. They have equanimity; or have recovered it after losing it; or have a control which implies pure and absolute non-injury to other souls; they may be all but passionless; or they may be entirely ideal and passionless. So Shakespeare says : - “Give me that man
That is not passion's slave and I will wear him. In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart."
(Hamlet. Act IV Sc. 2.) The above 6 degrees of control give us the Quest of souls with regard to their control.
9. Four conation-quests (Darshana.) The four kinds of co-nation, ocular, non-ocular, visual, and perfect given before form the Conation-Quest.
10.-Six-Thought-Paints (Leshyá). Every-thing which is matter, or mixed up with matter has some kind or other of touch, taste, smell and colour. Our mind and its activity are no exception. They are material and have colour, which they change with every change of their thought activity. A black-hearted man; red with rage; pale with fear; green with jealousy ;-these are familiar phrases. Our thoughts and emotions have a very intimate connection with colours. We may be said to have thought-paints. There are innumerable intermediate characters of paints: but the primary ones are black, blue, grey, yellow, pink or red and white. These 6 form the Soul Quest as to Thought-paint. The Leshyás are the Soul's vibrations effected by mild and strong passions.
11.-Liberability (Bhavyatva). You may seek souls in two classes; those who are capable of Liberation and those who are not capable of Liberation. The capacity of Liberation is the basis of this Quest.
12,--Six Beliefs (Samyaktva). No living being is without some kind of creed, set of beliefs. He may or may not realise or analyse them. He may or may not express them to himself or any one else; but there they are in his inner being always.
Matter deludes the belief and conduct of the soul. But when matter subsides or entirely falls off, we have flashes of right faith and righteous conduct. This right belief may be due to the subsidence or destruction or part-destruction part-subsidence of the matter which keeps it submerged and deluded.




Page #67
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

56
Three stages of this right belief are noticeable. To begin with, there is its absence, i.e., there is wrong belief. Then you may acquire right belief but lose it and slip from it to wrong belief, the condition of your belief during downfall. Thirdly, the condition of mixed right and wrong belief.
The above 2 triads give us 6 classes. These may be called Subsidential, Destructive, Destructive-Subsidential, Wrong belief, downfall belief and mixed right wrong belief. Here right belief is the basis of the Quest.
13.- Mind-Quest (Sanjná). Souls have mind or not. They are Rational or Irrational. This is the Rationality Quest.
14.-Assimilation-Quest (Ánára). Souls are in an incarnation, as celestial, human, sub-human, and hellish being; there they are assimilating particles of matter for their physical bodies every instant.
But in transmigration from one condition of existence to another there is no assimilation of matter of physical body. This distinction gives us the Assimilation Quest. That is, souls are :
(1) those who are assimilating matter of their birth bodies
(Áháráká Varganá); or (2) those who are not so assimilating it, i.e., in transmig
ration in the three instants of omniscient overflow in the 13th stage, and in the 14th stage.
III.-Spiritual Stages. If we mark the freedom of pure soul from the impurifying bondage of matter we notice 14 stages.
1. The soul has delusion. It has wrong belief. (Mithyátva).
2. It had Right Belief, but it is falling from that to Wrong Belief. This is the Downfall Stage. (Sásádana).
3. It is in a stage of Mixed Right and Wrong Belief. (Mishra).
4. It has Right Belief; but does not act upon it; does not resolve or vow to follow it in actual life. It is Vowless Right Belief. (Avirata Samyaktva).
5. It may follow it by partial vows. We may call it the partial Vow-stage. (Desha-Vrata):
6. It may be with all possible vows, but may keep them imperfectly. Owing to negligence or illness (Pramáda). Call it the partial Vow-stage. Pramatta-vrata).
7. If it has all Vows and keeps them perfectly, we have the Perfect Vow-stage. (Apramatta virata),




Page #68
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿________________

57
8. When all vows are kept perfectly, then new inner progress begins. The soul has a new inner thought-activity. Call it the New Thought-Activity (Apúrva-Karana).
9. Further advance gives us the Advanced Thought-Activity stage (Nirvritti-Karana).
10. Then we near the Goal. Delusion is leaving us. When it has all but left us, call it the stage of Slightest Delusion (Súkshama-Sámparaya).
11. If all Delusion has entirely subsided, we call the stage one of Subsided Delusion (Upashanta-moha).
12. If Delusion is destroyed, we are in the stage of Destroyed Delusion (Kshína moha).
13. Then the soul knows all, sees all. Still it has the body of its last incarnation and it vibrates as every body does at every instant. We call this the stage of Vibratory Omniscience (Sayogakevali).
14. When the body vibrations stop, the stage is of nonVibratory Omniscience. It is of a short duration, and is called Ayoga-Kevali. Then the soul is at the end of its mundane existence and becomes liberated from all Karmic matter for ever; and rushes upward to enjoy its own eternal, supra-sensual, undisturbable, Infinite Bliss along with Infinite Knowledge, Conation, Perfect Right Belief, and Power. It is Siddha. It is itself. The goal is reached. The ideal is realised. It is the acme of Fineness. It has no high or low class, because all pure souls are the same. It is interpenetrable with them. There is no struggle for existence; because there is pure and full existence for all. It dropped its last body for ever and thus has a size slightly less than that. It has reached the end of the Universe and is steady there. Its modifications are its own perpetual continuous self-modifications.
In the 14 stages it is noticeable that our progress is from Wrong-Belief to Right-Belief, then to Vows, then to perfectly careful Vows, then to Passionlessness and then to a cessation of the Vibratory Activity of Body, Speech, and Mind, which induces the inflow of matter into the soul. In other words, we are beset by 5 kinds of innate evils or imperfections. These are Wrong-belief, Vowlessness, Carelessness, Passion and Vibratory Activity. We shed Wrong-belief at the end of the first. Vowlessness at the end of the fourth, Carelessness at the end of the 6th and Passions at the end of the tenth, and Vibratory Activity at the end of the thirteenth stage.

Introductory.
1. Bowing to the Liberated, Pure, Spotless Moon, (Lord) Nemi, Supreme among Jinendras (Conquerors), I shall speak of the (part) descriptive of the Soul, in which sparkle the ornaments of jewels of qualities.
Commentary.
Liberated (Siddham)-(Siddha) literally means that which is accomplished. Here the acquisition of self-realisation was the object, accomplished by Lord Nemi.
Pure (Shuddham)-(Shuddha) following? siddha," the linguistic beauty of Alliteration is obvious.-" Pure" here means free from the four destructive (Ghátíya) Karmas.
Spotless Moon (Chandramakalamkam).-Figure of Oxymoron. Moon is known for spots; this is a defect in her otherwise perfect beauty. Lord Nemi is perfect. Therefore he is a spotless moon.

Note.-Nemi Chandra is the name of the author also. But some take it to be used as the name of Lord Nemi also, who is generally adored under the name of Neminatha, as the 22nd Tirthamkara of the Jainas.

Qualities (Guna).-This indicates the three jewels : right beliet, right knowledge, and right conduct, which jointly characterise a Liberated Soul.
Jewels (Ratna).- The above three Jewels (ratna-traya) are meant.
Descriptive (Prarúpanam) - The part describing the soul, i.e., (Jíva Kanda) the name of the book.
(Gunaratna bhúsanodayam).-In which treatise appear the brilliant three Jewels and infinite other attributes of a Perfect Soul.
Nemi.- Lord Nemi, the 22nd Tirthamkara is adored in this (Gáthá) because the temple named (Mahápúta) (lit. very pure) at Sravanabelgola (also called Gommata Svámi), contains the image of Lord Nemi. This Mahápúta was built by Rájá Chámunda Raya, Minister of Maharaja Rája-Malla Deva, of the Ganga dynasty. RájaMalla was a pupil of the Saint Simha Nandi,
In a book there are 6 parts.
Invocation (Mangala); Occasion of writing it (Nimitta); Object (Hetu); Extent, number of (Gáthás), etc.,(Parimána); name of book (nám a); and Author (Kartá).
In this book, Gatha 1 is the invocation to Lord Nemi. The occasion was the question put to the author Sri Nemi Chandra by Chámunda-Raya. The question was: How does the body-making (Náma) Karma exist in fine (súkshma) non-developable (aparýápta,) earth-bodied souls, etc. ? The object is to propagate the tradition of Truth from master to pupil. The number of Gáthas in Jiva Kánda is 735. The name is Jiva Kánda. The author is the Saint, Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti.
Gommata Sára is also called (Pancha Sangraha), a collection of five topics :
1. That which is bound, i.e., the Soul (Bandhaka); 2. That which is bound to the soul (Badhyamána); 3. That which binds (Bandha Svámi);
4. The varieties of bondage (Bandha Bheda); - 5. The cause of bondage (Bandha Hetu).
The first of these, namely, (Bandhaka) i. e., the mundane soul forms the subject-matter of Jíva Kanda (Jivasya Prarú panam, description of the soul.) The other four form the subject-matter of Karma Kánda.

GOMMATASARA.
This Gommatasára is based on the Great Book Dhavala written by the saint Bhútabali. Dhavala is a constituent of the great trilogy Dhavala, Jaya Dhavala, Maha - Dhavala. All these three were composed by the saints Bhútabali and Pushpadanta, who were the pupils of Dharasenáchárya.
गुणजीवा पज्जत्ती पारणा सरणाय मग्गणात्र य । उवओगोविय कमसो वीसं तु परूवणा भणिदा ॥ २ ॥ गुणजीवाः पर्याप्तयः प्राणाः संज्ञाश्च मार्गणाश्च । उपयोगोपि च क्रमशः विंशतिस्तु प्ररूपणा भणिताः ॥ २ ॥
2. (14) Spiritual stages (Guná-Sthána); (14) Soul classes (Jiva Samása); (6 kinds of) capacity to develope (Paryápti) ; (10) Vitalities (Prána ) ; ( 4 ) Impulses, or animate feelings (Sanjná); and (14) Soul-quests (Márganá) also ; ( 12 kinds of) conscious attentiveness (Upayoga), respectively have been described (in) 20 chapters.
Commentary.
In the 20 chapters, the 14 soul-quests alone form 14 chapters, the others take only one chapter each.
संखे घोत्तिय गुणसराणा सा च मोहजोगभवा । वित्थारादेसोति य मग्गासराणा सकम्मभवा ॥ ३ ॥ संक्षेप ओघ इति च गुणसंज्ञा सा च मोहयोग भवा । विस्तार आदेश इति च मार्गणासंज्ञा स्वकर्मभवा ॥ ३ ॥

3. Summary (Samkshepa) and Proposition (Ogha) (are) the other names for the spiritual stages (Guna Sthána), The spiritual stages are due to delusion (Moha) and soul's vibratory activity (Yoga ). Detail ( Vistára) and exposition (Adesha) (are) the other names for the soul-quest (Márganá). The (14) soul-quests (are) due to (the operation of) their (corresponding) Karmas.

Commentary.
The spiritual stages are called summary or propositional, because they are the general names of the 14 stages, to some one or other of which all mundane souls must belong at a given moment

of time. Evidently this is merely a brief classification. The 14 soul-quests with their 74 or 95 sub-divisions give the details about each one of these infinite souls classified into 14 spiritual stages ; therefore, the soul-guests are also called detail or exposition of the mundane souls.
आदेसे संलीणा जीवा पज्जत्तिपाणसण्णाओ। उबओगोवि य भेदे वीसं तु परूबणा भणिदा ॥ ४॥
आदेशे सलीना जीवाः पर्याप्तिप्राणसंज्ञाश्च । उपयोगोपि च भेदे विंशतिस्तु प्ररूपणा भणिताः ॥ ४॥
4. In exposition (Adesha, i.e., soul-quest) are included (14) soul-classes, (Jiva-Samása), (6 kinds of capacity to develope (Paryapati), (10) Vitalities (Prana) and (4) impulses or animate feelings (Sanjná), also (12 kinds of) conscious attentiveness (Upayoga). (Thus really there are only two chapters, 14 Spiritual Stages and 14 Soul-Quests,) but by (further) division 20 chapters have been laid down.

5. In the sense and body soul-quest, (Indriya and Kaya Margana) are included the (14) soul-classes (Jiva Samása), (6 kinds of) capacity to develope, (Paryápti,) and respiration, speech-power, and mind-power vitalities (Shvasochhvasa, Bhasha-Bala and Mana-Bala-Prana). In the vibratory activity soul-quest (Yoga Márganá) (is included) the body (power vitality) (Kaya-Bala-Prana).

The age (Ayuh) vitality is included in the condition of existence soul-quest, because they always co-exist. They begin together and end together. The age Karma determines the duration of the particular condition of existence in which the mundane soul is found; and the duration of the condition of existence is exactly the length of time that the age Karma lasts. Thus evidently the age vitality is the vitality which is co-existent with, and therefore. included in, the condition of existence.
The 14 soul-classes are evidently included in the 5 senses, and 6 embodiment soul-quests. The gross and fine immobile (Súkshma and Vádara Sthávara) souls are included in one sensed beings. The rational (Sanjní) and irrational (Asanjní) mobile (Trasa) souls are included in the five-sensed beings.
The 6 kinds of capacity to develope (Paryapti) are included in the 5 senses and 6 embodiment soul-quests, because the development has reference to one or more of the 5 senses and 6 embodiments.
The three vitalities, respiration, speech-power, and mind-power are respectively the effect of the last three of the 6 capacities to develope. The capacities being included in the sense and embodiment soul-quests, the vitalities are also included in the same. The body-power vitality is the cause of vibratory activities, (Yoga) of 7 embodiments (Káya); therefore this vitality is included in the embodiment-vibratory-activity soul-quest.
Coition animate-feeling is dependent upon sexes, therefore it is included in the sex soul-quest.
Fear animate-feeling is included in the passions of anger and pride as, on ultimate analysis, these two passions, in some form or other, are involved in it. Similarly hunger animate feeling is included in the passions of deceit and greed. Worldly attachment animate-feeling is evidently included in the passion of greed.
The 5 sense-vitalities and definite (knowledge) conscious attentiveness are included in their effects, (the 8 kinds of knowledge,) in the knowledge soul-quest; similarly indefinite conscious attentiveness is included in the conation soul-quest.

8. The thought activities caused by the operation, etc. (of Karmas by which souls are distinguished (are) spiritual stages, (as) has been described by the All seeing.
Commentary. Operation, etc., (Udayadi). - 5 kinds of thought-activities are recognised in Jainism.
____I.-Subsidential (Aupashamika). This arises by the subsidence (Upashama) of the deluding (Mohaniya) Karmic matter. It is of 2 kinds.
II.--Destructive (Ksháyika). It arises from the destruction of 4 obstructive (Ghatiya) Karmas. It is of 9 kinds.
III.- Destructive-subsidential (Kshyayopashamic). It arises by partial destruction, partial subsidence, and partial operation of the destructive Karmas. It is of 18 kinds.
IV.- Operative (Audayika). It arises by the operation of the Karmas. It is of 21 kinds.
V. - Natural (Párinámika). This activity consists of the self-modification of the soul. It is of 3 kinds.
Thus the total number of kinds of thought-activity is 53. (Vide Tattvártha Sutra Chapter II, Sutras 1 to 6).
The possession of a different set of thought-activities distinguishes one class of souls from another. The different classes are called the different spiritual stages or (Gunasthána).
मिच्छो सासण मिस्सो अविरदसम्मो य देसविरदो य।।

9. Delusion (Mithyatva), Downfall (Sásádana), Mixed (Mishra), and Vowless right belief (Avirata Samyaktva), Partial vow (Desha-Virata); Imperfect vow (Pramatta-Virata), the other, i. e., perfect vow (Pramatta-Virata); New thought-activity (Apúrva Karana), Advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana), and Slightest delusion (Súkshma Sámparaya).

10. Subsided-delusion (Upashānta Moha), Delusionless (Kshina Moha), Vibrating omniscient Conqueror (Sayoga Kevali Jina), and Non-vibrating omniscient (Ayoga Kevali): these should be known to be the 14 spiritual stages (Jíva Samasa-Gunasthāna) one after another. After the last, the souls become liberated (Siddha).
Commentary. The first four are vowless (Avirta); and the fifth, and all the following are vowful (Virata) stages. The 13th and all that precede it are with vibratory activity (Sayogi). The fourth and the following are the stages of the Conqueror (Jina), because the soul in the 4th stage has conquered the right-belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Mohaniya) i. e., the Karma which deludes the soul from right belief.
In reality the different thought-activities are innumerable. But as there are some prominent ones, commonly found in mundane souls, we are enabled to classify them into 14 stages.
मिच्छे खलु ओदइओ विदिये पुण पारणामिओ भावो। मिस्से खोबसमिओ अविरदसम्ममि तिण्णेव ॥११॥ मिथ्यात्वे खलु औदयिको द्वितीये पुनः पारणामिको भावः । मिश्रे क्षायोपशमिकः अविरतसम्यक्त्वे त्रय एव ॥ ११ ॥

11. In delusion (Mithyátva-Gunasthána) there is certainly the thought-activity due to the operation of Karmas (Audayika Bháva), and in the second (Downfall, Sásádana), natural (Párinamika) thought-activity. In the mixed (Mishra), the destructive subsidential-thought activity, (and) in the vowless-right-belief (Avirata Samyaktva) all the three i. e., subsidential, destructive and destructive-subsidential, (Aupashamika, Ksháyika and Kshayopashamika).
एदे भावा णियमा दंसणमोहं पडुच्च भणिदा हु । चारित्तं णत्थि जदो अविरद अन्तेसु ठाणेसु ॥ १२॥ एते भावा नियमाद्दर्शनमोहं प्रतीत्य भणिताः खलु । चारित्रं नास्ति यतो अविरतान्तेषु स्थानेषु ॥ १२ ॥
12. These thought-activities are certainly necessari. ly said to be from the view-point of the right-belief-delud. ing Karma (Darshana-Moha) because up to the end of vowless (Avirata) stage (i. e., in the first 4 spiritual stages), (there) is no right conduct (Cháritra).
Commentary. From this it is obvious that there can be no right conduct without first acquiring right belief.
देसविरदे पमत्ते इदरे य खोबसमियभावो दु । सो खलु चरित्तमोहं पडुच्च भणियं तहा उबरिं ॥ १३॥ देशविरते प्रमत्ते इतरे च क्षायोपशमिकभावस्तु ।
स खलु चारित्रमोहं प्रतीत्य भणितस्तथा उपरि ॥ १३ ॥ 18. In the Partial, Imperfect, and the other (i. e., Perfect) vow, (Desha-virata, Pramatta-Virata and Apramatta-Virata) (there is) the destructive-subsidential thought-activity. This certainly is said to be from the view-point of right-conduct-deluding-Karma (Charitra Mohaniya). The same for higher stages.

तत्तो उवरि उवसमभावो उवसामगेसु खबगेसु । खइओ भावो णियमा अजोगिचरिमोत्ति सिद्धे य॥१४॥ तत उपरि उपशमभाव उपशामकेषु क्षपकेषु । क्षायिको भावो नियमात् अयोगिचरम इति सिद्ध च ॥ १४ ॥
14. Beyond this (i. e., the 7th stage), in the (4) subsidential stages, (i. e., the Sth, 9th, 10th and 11th) the thought-activity (is) subsidential, and in the (4) destructive stages (i. e., 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th), and up to end of the non-vibrating omniscient stage, (i. e., in the 13th and 14th), and in the liberated soul (there is) necessarily the - destructive" thought-activity.
Commentary. The 7th stage of perfect vows (Apramatta-Virata) is of two kinds; ordinary perfect vows. (Svas-thána-Appramatta), in which the soul wavers to and fro between the perfect and the imperfect vow stages, i. e., constantly comes down to the 6th and then goes back to the 7th stage; or extraordinary perfect vow (Sátishaya Appramatta) in which the soul can go beyond the 7th stage. This the soul can do along two ladders, subsidential ladder (Upashama Shrení) or destructive ladder (Ksháyika Shrení). The ascent along the subsidential ladder, as the name implies, is when the thoughtactivity is due to the subsidence of the matter of the right-conduct-deluding Karma. The ascent from the extraordinary perfect vow, (Sátishaya Apramatta), 7th stage is as follows:-First to the stage of New-thought-activity (Apúrva Karana) 8th stage; then to-Advanced-thought-activity (Anivritti Karana), the 9th stage ; then Slightest-delusion (Súkshma Sámparáya), the 10th stage ; and then to Subsided-delusion (Upashánta Moha), the 11th stage. Along the subsidential ladder the soul cannot advance further: The duration of the soul's stay in this stage is one antarmuhúrta, i.e., from one ávali plus one Samaya up-to 48 minutes minus one Samaya. After this very short sojourn in the 11th stage, the soul must gradually come down to any of the lower stages.
Ascent along the destructive ladder, as the name implies, is when the thought-activity is due to destruction of the matter of the right-conduct-deluding Karma. In this ladder, the ascent from the 7th extraordinary stage is as follows:--New-thought-aetivity,

the 8th; Advanced-thought-activity, the 9th; Slightest-delusion, the 10th; and Delusionless, (Kshína-Moha) the 12th. Note that in this ascent, the soul does not touch the 11th stage, which is the peculiar and direct effect of the subsidential-thought-activity; but goes from the 10th direct to the 12th stage, delusionless. This is the effect of destroying the deluding Karma which can no more rise to delude the soul. Therefore, evidently, there can be no fall from this stage: once arrived here. the soul must rise to the 13 then having all but exhausted the age Karma, (Ayuh), hasten through the 14th stage in which it drops off all vestiges of matterin the form of the 4 non-destructive Karmas, and attains final and everlasting liberation, मिच्छोदयेण मिच्छत्तमसदहणं तु तच्चअत्थाणं ।
एयंतं विबरीयं विणयं संसयिदमण्णाणं ॥ १५ ॥ मिथ्यात्वोदयेन मिथ्यात्वमश्रद्धानं तु तत्त्वार्थानाम् । एकान्तं विपरीतं विनयं संशयितमज्ञानम् ॥ १५ ॥
15. (The delusion stage) or wrong. belief thoughtactivity (Mithyátva) is caused by the operation of the wrong-belief, (Mithyátva) sub-class of the right-belief-deluding Karma. It consists in not having belief in things as they are (Tattvārtha) (i. e., the seven Principles, Tattvas of Jainism). Wrong-belief is of 5 kinds :
(1) One-sided belief (Ekanta). (2) Perverse belief (Viparita). (3) Veneration (of false creeds-Vinaya). (4) Doubtful belief (Samshaya).
(5) Indiscriminate belief (Ajnána). एयंत बुद्धदरसी विवरीओ बह्म तावसो विणओ। इंदो विय संसइयो मकडिओ चेव अण्णाणी ॥१६॥ एकान्तो बुद्धदर्शी विपरीतो ब्रह्म तापसो विनयः। इन्द्रोपि च संशयितो मस्करी चैवाज्ञानी ॥ १६ ॥

Tápasa, and doubtful belief (Samshaya) as in the followers of Indra, (etc.), also indiscriminate belief (Ajnána) as in the followers of Maskari (etc.)
Commentary. Clear, reasoned argument is at the basis of Jaina belief. Not only right belief is necessary, but it must be based on right reasoning. One of the most important characteristics of Jainism is its many points of view (Anekánta) All things can be looked at from different points of view. Different standpoints yield different results, which sometimes seem to contradict each other. The value and the necessity of the many-sided doctrine are thus evident.
In all the five examples given above, there is apparent some sort of religious belief, self-denial, an admirable determination and devotion, but on a deeper consideration all the five turn out to be merely varieties of error of one kind or another. Thus, Buddhism believes that every thing is transient ; this is perfectly true so far as the ever-present modifications of substances are concerned. but these modifications must depend upon something in which they are going on. That some thing remains one throughout its modi. fications. Truth tells us that every substance is characterised by a number of attributes and modifications. Its modifications are always changing, but its attributes, which make it the particular individual substance, last throughout all these changes. The substance is called Dravya, its attributes Guna, its modifications Paryáva. The coming in of the view modification is Utpáda ; the going out of the old one is Vyaya ; and the lasting sameness which always remains in the thing which is modified is called Dhrauvya. Buddhism also fixes its mind upon modifications. But it ignores the permanence of the substance upon which the modifications depend. This is what is meant by saying that Budhism is only a one-sided and
e a kind of wrong belief. The Vedas are the most ancient and most authoritative revealed sacred books of the Hindus. Also they are characterised by the great importance of Yajna, sacrifice of many kinds. Goats, sheep, horses, cows, even human beings, were brought to the sacrificial altar to gain merit and reward in this world and in the next. The great perversity and ignorance of this kind of belief is obvious. The first thing to realise is that there is a common or similar current of life in all living beings, and that any injury to the vitality of the lowest animal is as hurtful and painful to it as to the highest human

being. Then it would be conceded that it is the duty of every thinking spiritual being not to hurt anything that lives, and that it is the greatest sin to neglect this first precept of Life. How can then killing animals for sacrifice bring any good here or hereafter to the killer or the killed or indeed to any body else? No example could be a more patent illustration of perverse belief.
Much less justifiable and much more sinful and censurable, then, is the killing of animals for food or sport. Belief that such taking of life is right or excusable is certainly a perverse belief. The enormity and sinfulness of modern Wars is obvious.
True veneration is always the due of real and universal truth, and of those who have realised it themselves, and are willing and capable of helping others to realise it.
When this veneration is paid to a lesser doctrine or person, it is a sign that the belief which inspires it, is not right. When ignorant or superstitious people worship the goddess Mátá, Sítlá, to remove their small-pox or to give them children; or even educated or scientific people claim provisional or incomplete truth to be whole and eternal truth, and venerate it as such their veneration cannot be called right-belief, because it is directed towards a partially or wholly wrong matter.
When a man is not sure about the ultimate right or wrong of his belief, he is said to have wrong belief due to doubt. For example, like the saint Indra, who was in doubt whether a woman could or could not attain liberation.
People, who mortify the flesh to save the soul, venerate and follow the wrong. The flesh must be subordinated to the soul, but blind hurting of the flesh is not the true path to the liberation of the soul.
Right belief is belief in things as they really exist. It in volves a true knowledge of these things. Any indiscrimination or absence of knowledge, to whatever cause it may be due, prevents the belief from being complete and right. Then the Ajnána kind of wrong belief is said to arise.
मिच्छंतं वेदंतो जीवो विवरीयदंसणो होदि। ण य धम्मं रोचेदि हु महुरं खु रसं जहा जरिदो॥१७॥ मिथ्यात्वं विदन् जीवो विपरीतदर्शनो भवति । न च धम्मै रोचते हि मधुरं खलु रसं यथा ज्वरितः ॥१७॥

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
belief (Mithyátva) the right belief being lost, the (stage) should be known by the name of Downfall (Sásana or Sásádana).
Commentary.
Subsidential right-belief is of 2 kinds (1) Prathamaupashama Samyaktva-the first subsidential-right-belief. It may arise (1) in a soul which has never had right-belief, by the subsidence of the four Error-feeding passions (4 Anantánubandhi Kashayas) and wrong-belief Mithyátva; or (2) in a soul which has had (but has lost) right-belief, by the subsidence of the above 5, and of the 2, mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Samiaktva Mithyátva) and right-belief-clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief (Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyátva) Karmas.
(2) Dvitíyopashama Samyaktva, the second subsidential rightbelief. It arises in a saint in the 7th spiritual stage of perfect vows, when the saint is preparing to pass on to the 8th stage of New-thought-activity along the ladder of subsidential advancement, having been already a right believer of the destructionsubsidential kind. He transforms the nature of the four error-feeding passions, into lesser passions, and causes the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karmas, namely, Mithyátva, Samyaktva Mithyátva, and Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyátva. The right-belief of this saint is called the second subsidential rightbelief.
The matter of wrong belief Karma by being subjected to the thought-activity of the first subsidential right-belief is changed into the above 3 kinds. Wrong belief has the largest number of molecules. Mixed-right-and-wrong belief has a number of molecules innumerably less than it. And right-belief-clouded-by-slightwrong-belief innumerably less than those of mixed-right-andwrong-belief.
In (Gáthá) 11, the thought-activity in this stage is said to be the natural (Párináamika) thought-activity of the soul; this is so because the right belief which the soul had acquired in the 4th stage has left it, and it has not yet fallen back into the stage of wrong belief (Mithyátva). The minimum duration of the fall is one instant of time, and the maximum is 6 winks (Avali). During this downfall the soul has neither right belief nor wrong belief, therefore it is said to have its natural (Párinamika) thought-activity; because right-belief-deluding Karma (Mithyátva) has not yet begun to operate, but will do so after 6 winks at the most, i. e., when the

soul has fallen down to the first stage of delusion (Mithyátva).. Note, however, that the downfall itself is due to the operation of the error-feeding passion. From this point of view in the downfall (Sásádana) stage the soul is said to have operative thought-activity (Audayika Bháva). सम्मामिच्छुदयेण जत्तरसव्वघादिकज्जेण।। णय सम्म मिच्छं पि य सस्मिस्सो होदि परिणामो॥२१॥ सम्यग्मिथ्यात्वोदयेन च जात्यन्तरसर्वघातिकार्येण । नच सम्यक्त्वं मिथ्यात्वमपि च सम्मिश्रो भवति परिणामः ॥२१॥
21. On the operation of the right-and-wrong belief or mixed (Samyaktva-Mithyátva or Mishra kind of the right-belief-deluding Karma, Darshana Moha), which is a slightly different kind of all-destructive Karmic matter (Sarvagháti Prakriti), (there) is neither (entirely) right belief, nor (entirely) wrong belief, (but) the thought activity is mixed (i. e., a mixture of right and wrong belief). (This is the description of 3rd or mixed spiritual stage (Mishra Gunasthána). •
Commentary. Játyantara Sarvagháti.- There are 4 destructive (Ghảtiya) Karmas ; Deluding (Mohaniya) Karma is one of them. It is of two kinds : right-belief-deluding (Darshana Mohaníya) and right-conduct-deluding (cháritra-mohaniya). Right-belief-deluding Karma is of three kinds :
(1) Wrong belief (mithyátva). (2) Mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Mashra or Samyaktva
| Mithyatva). (3) Right-belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief (Samyaktva
Prakriti Mithyátva). All these three classes are of "destructive" Karmic matter; but there is a difference in their degrees. Mithyátva is all distructive (sarvagháti) of right belief. Mishra is slightly different from Mithyátva, because it does not effect a total destruction of right belief, as in it there is always present some right belief mixed with wrong belief.

The 3rd is still legs destructive. It is called partially des tructive (Deshaghati). In this, right belief is not destroyed, but only slightly clouded by wrong belief.

22. The (mixed) thought-activity can in no way be split up into its two parts right and wrong belief), as (taste of) mixed curd and treacle (cannot be referred separately to curd or sugar). The thought activity mixed like this should be known to be the mixed (Saymaktva Mithyátva stage).
सो संजमंण गिण्हदि देसजमं वा ण बंधदे आउं । सम्म वा मिच्छं वा पडिवज्जिय मरदि णियमेण ॥ २३॥ स संयमं न गृह्णाति देशयमं वा न बध्नाति आयुः । सम्यक्त्वं वा मिथ्यात्वं वा प्रतिपद्य म्रियते नियमेन ॥ २३ ॥
28. One (in this stage) adopts neither control (samyama i. e., the vows of the saint) nor partial control (Desha Samyama, i. e., partial vows of the layman), nor does (one) bind the age (Ayuh Karmic matter to oneself); and necessarily one dies having acquired right belief or wrong belief.

24. Wherever, in the right or wrong-belief thoughtactivities, he has already bound to himself the age Karma (of his next incarnation), there (alone will be his), death;

nor does the death-bed overflow (máranántika samudgháta take place) in the mixed (Mishra stage).
Commentary.
19
One thing must always be remembered with regard to this and the preceding stage. They are both more or less transitory. The utility and necessity of the downfall (sásádana) stage is simply to mark or explain the thought-activity of the soul during the very short time which it takes in its downfall from right belief in the 4th to wrong belief in the 1st stage. The thought-activity in the mixed stage also is of very short duration, one (Antar-Muhúrta), the minimum being a wink (Ávalí) and an instant, and the maximum being 48 minutes minus one instant. In the thoughtactivity in this stage the soul is both a wrong and right believer. The preservation of wrong belief makes it impossible that he should practise any vows. The vows are reserved for the 5th stage and onwards. They are a part of right conduct; and right conduct must always be preceded and accompanied by right knowledge and right belief.
Another noticeable thing is this. In the mixed stage, as also in the thought-activity due to subsidential-right-belief, there is no bondage of the matter of age-karma. The bondage of the age-karma, as also the death before reincarnation (the agekarma for an incarnation is bound to the soul in the immediately preceding birth, so that a man is born with an age-karma already binding his soul) must take place from the first or the fourth spiritual stage. According to Shri Nemi-Chandra-Áchárya, the death must be from that very stage in which the age-karma is bound. But the commentary of Shri-Abhaya-Chandra page 49, (Gommatsára Jíva-Kánda, Calcutta Press) mentions another opinion that the death must be from the 1st or the 4th stage, but not necessarily from the one in which the age-karma was bound. In this stage there is no death-bed overflow of the soul; this is necessary, because there is no death in this stage.
It would be seen that there can be no bondage of age-karma in this stage, because at a man's death-bed, the same thoughtactivity must prevail by which the age-karma of its next incarnation was bound. And as there can be no death in this, there can be no bondage of age-karma in this stage.
Now why should a man not die in this stage?

Perhaps it is that the vitalities, which keep up the inevitable struggle between right and wrong belief, grow extremely weak

as a man approaches death, and therefore he drops, as it were, into right or wrong belief without offering great resistance.

25. By the operation of right-belief-slightly-cloudedby-wrong-belief, (Samyaktva-Prakriti-Mithyátva, i, e., the partial-destructive-class of right-belief-deluding Karma) there arises destructive-subsidential-right-belief (Vedaka or Kshayopashama. Samyaktva). It is wavering (chala), impure (Malina), non-steadfast (Agadha), but it (is) always a cause of the destruction of Karmas.

26. Subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva) arises by subsidence of (all the) seven (kinds of Karmic matter, i. e. of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karma Darshana Moha, and the 4 error-feeding passions (Anantánubandhi kasháya). But by the destruction of these seven arises the destructive-right-belief, Ksháyika (Samyaktva). And by the operation of the second (class, i, e., partial-vow-preventing or Apratyákhyána) passions this right belief is without control (Asamyata) or vowless.
Commentary. The 4th stage is called Avirata or Asamyata Samyaktva or vowless-right-belief. Vows cannot appear in it because there is operation of the partial-vow-preventing passions (Apratyákhyáná varana kasháya). The right belief in this stage may be of three kinds. The latter kind is always preceded by the former :These three kinds of right belief are as follows :--

GOMMATASARA.
1. Subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva).-It is of two kinds, (i) first (Prathama) (ii) second (dvitíya). (See under Gathas 19-20 above). The duration of this is at the most one Antar muhúrta. From this the soul falls down to the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd stage. This three-fold downfall has been described above in the preceding Gathas. If there is no downfall, then after the expiry of its duration, it changes into the second kind of right belief.
21
2. Destructive-subsidential-right-belief
(Kshayopashama-Sam
yaktva) in which there is the operation of right-belief-slightly clouded-by-wrong-belief, (Samyaktva-Prakriti-Mithyâtva) the last of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karma, (Darshana Moha), and the other 2 sub-classes along with the 4 error-feeding passions are partially destroyed and partially in subsidence. The minimum duration of this destructive-subsidential right-belief is one AntarMuhúrta; and the maximum is 66 Ságaras. This maximum is made up of 13 Sagaras in the 7th heaven, 22 in the 16th, and 31 Ságaras in the highest (Graiveyaka).
3. Destructive-right-belief (Ksháyika Samyaktva).-It arises by the destruction of all the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deludingkarma and the 4 error-feeding passions. This is the best and highest kind of right belief; once gained, it lasts for ever. The soul that acquires it, must-attain liberation at the latest in 33 Ságaras and 2 crore -Púrvas, minus 8 years and one AntarMuhúrta. This maximum is possible for a human being who is born in Videha Kshetra, (one of the seven divisions of Jambú Dweepa), and has the maximum age of one crore Púrva. From there he can, after completing his age, attain Sarvártha Siddhi (the highest heaven) with an age of 33 Ságaras. He may thereafter be born again in Videha Kshetra with the maximum age of one crore Púrva, after which he must attain liberation. As a human being can not attain destructive-right-belief before reaching the age of 8 years, and as the period for the attainment of destructive-right-belief is one antar-muhúrta, we have to deduct 8 years and one antar-muhúrta from 33 Ságaras and 2 crore Púrvas, to fix the maximum duration of destructive-right-belief. This arises only at the feet of the Omniscient Kevali or the allscripture-knowing Shruta Kevalí saints.
=
The destructive-right-belief is perfect. There is no matter to cloud or disturb it, but in the destructive-subsidential-right belief

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
there is the operation of that class of Karmic matter which gives rise to right-belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief. This slight clouding takes the form of the 3 defects -wavering (chala), defective or impure (mala), and non-steadfast (agádha).
By wavering; (chala) is meant that condition of right-belief in which its substance remains quite sound, but only the form is slightly disturbed, as the surface of the ocean is. disturbed by the waves ; an example of it, which is generally, given is that of a man who worships Shantinátha specially, rather than the other Tirthankaras for acquiring peace or Shánti.
By defective or impure (mala), is meant right-belief which has got the five following defects :
(1) Shanká --Doubt, Scepticism. (2) Kánkshá - Desire of sense pleasures. (3) Jugupsá- Disgust with a sick or deformed person. (4) Anyadrishţi-Prashansa-Thinking admiringly of wrong
believers. (5) Anyadrishți Samstava-Praising wrong believers.
By non-steadfast (Agádha) is meant right-belief which is not quite fixed in the true nature of things ; for example, worshipping in one's own temple in preference to the temple built by others. It is something like a mirror attached to a pivot, to which it is not firmly fixed. It will show a perfect image but not steady. For a man who has steadfast right-belief knows that it makes not the slightest difference, whether you worship in your temple or in one built by your neighbour.
These 3 defects do not occur in subsidential-right-belief also. In this and in the destructive-right-belief, the vision is clear, and there is no room for doubt or defects. None of these 7 Karmas is operative to cloud the clearness of the vision. It is only in the destructive-subsidential-right-belief that the Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyátva is operative, and therefore these defects arise.*
सम्माइट्टी जीवो उपइट्ठ पबयणं तु सदहदि । सदहदि असम्भावं अजाणमाणो गुरुणियोगा॥२७॥
* It is worth while to consider and compare these 3 defects with 5 kinds of (Mithyátva and the eight angâs of Samyaktva).

सम्यग्दृष्टिर्जीव उपदिष्टं प्रवचनं तु श्रद्दधाति । श्रद्दधात्यसद्भावमज्ञायमानो गुरुनियोगात् ॥ २७ ॥
27. The right-believing soul believes in the doctrines as preached (by the Conquerors), but (sometimes) by the instruction of an ignorant teacher he believes in the nature of things as they are not.
सुत्तादो तं सम्मं दरसिज्जंतं जदा ण सदहदि । सो चेष हवइ मिच्छाइट्ठी जीवो तदो पहुदी ॥ २८॥ . सूत्रात्तं सम्यक् दशर्यन्तं यदा न श्रद्दधाति । स चैव भवति मिथ्यादृष्टिीवस्तदा प्रभृति ॥ २ ॥
28. If on that (error) being satisfactorily exposed on the authority of Sutra, he does not believe (in the truth then), from that moment he certainly becomes a wrong believer.
Commentary. (Sutra) is a part of sacred literature but here it means the whole of authoritative Jaina sacred literature.
णो इन्दियेसु विरदो णो जीवे थावरे तसे वापि । जो सदहदि जिणुत्तं सम्माइट्ठी अविरदो सो ॥ २६ ॥ नो इन्द्रियेषु विरतो नो जीवे स्थावरे त्रसे वापि । यः श्रद्दधाति जिनोक्तं सम्यग्दृष्टिरविरतः सः ॥ २६ ॥
29. He who is vowless with regard to the senses, and also with regard to the (hurting of) mobile (Trasa) and immobile (Sthávara) living beings, and believes in what has been said by the Conqueror (Jina)" is a vowless right believer (Avirata-Samyak-drishti),
Commentary. In this stage there is right belief, but conduct is not yet based on it. Even the vows of a layman are not adopted. He has not vowed to abstain from indulgence in the senses, or from hurting the vitalities of mobile and immobile living beings, although as a right believer he has his heart filled with 1. Compassion (Anukampá) 2. calmness (Prashama), (3) Fear of mundane exis

tence (Samvega), and (4) belief in the principle of truth (Ástikya) and therefore he does not hurt any one without provocation. Control (Samyama), or vow (vrata) relates to the senses or the vitalities. It is respectively called sense-control (Indriya Samyama) and vitality-control (Prana-Samyama). In sense-control one's own senses are restrained, and in vitality-control one restrains oneself from doing any injury to the ten vitalities of himself or others. The man in this stage of vowless right-belief takes no vows for any of these two kinds of control.
पच्चक्खा गुदयादो संजमभावो ण होदि णवार तु। थोववदो होदि तदो देसवदो होदि पंचमओ॥३०॥ प्रत्याख्यानोदयात् संयमभावो न भवति नवरि तु। स्तोकव्रतं भवति ततो देशव्रतो भवति पञ्चमः ॥ ३०॥
30. Owing to the operation of the total-vow-preventing passions (Pratyákhyáná-varana Kasháya which is a sub-division of the right-conduct-deluding Karma) the thought-activity which produces (perfect) control (Samyama) does not arise, but (there is) some control. Therefore the 5th (stage) is (called) the partial-vow (Deshavrata) stage.
Commentary. This partial-vow stage (Deshavrata) (has the destructive-subsidential thought-activity (Kshayopashama-Bháva), because in it there is partial destruction and partial subsidence of the Karmic matter of the passions which prevent total vow (Pratyákhyáná-varana Kasháya) and there is the operation (Udaya) of that kind of Karmic matter which forms such passions as prevent the vows only partially. So that in this stage only partial vows can be observed.
that in the destruction-subsidence (Kshayopashama) of Karmas, the destruction of part of the Karmic matter means that though the Karmic matter in the ordinary course of things does rise on its maturity to bear fruit, yet instead of bearing fruit, it simply passes along and leaves the soul, free. By subsidence (Upashama) is meant the precipitation, or subsiding, of those Karmas which are in actual bondage with the soul but which do not operate at th time. This destruction is called non-operative destruction (Udayabháva-Lakshana-kshaya), and the subsidence is called existencesubsidence (Sattárúpa Upashama).

जो तसबहादु विरदो अविरदय तह य थावरबहादो । एकसमयहि जीवो विरदाकिरदो जिणेक्कमई ॥ ३१ ॥ यस्त्रसबधाद्विरतः अविरतस्तथा च स्थावरबधात् । एकसमये जीवो विरताविरतो जिनैकमतिः ॥ ३१ ॥
31. (He) who vows against the killing of mobile ( trasa ) souls, and (is) vowless as to the killing of immobile (Sthávara) souls, and is entirely devoted to the Conqueror (Jina), is vowful and vowless (virata - avirata) at one and the same time.
25
Commentary.
This must be noted that this is a stage which is accompanied by right-belief. A right believer may be a vowless man. But he always carries compassion, etc., in his heart, therefore he never commits unprovoked or unnecessary sin, even if he has not vowed against its commission; so the soul in the fifth stage has not vowed not to hurt immobile souls, but naturally he would not hurt even immobile souls unnecessarily.
संजलणणोकसायाणुदयादो संजमो हवे जम्हा | मलजपमादोविय तम्हा हु पमत्तविरदो सो ॥ ३२ ॥ संज्वलननोकषायाणामुदयात्संयमो भवेद्यस्मात् । 'मलजननप्रमादोपि च तस्मात्खलु प्रमत्तविरतः सः ॥ ३२ ॥
32. Because by the operation of perfect-right-conduct preventing passions (Sanjvalana Kasháya) and minor passions (Nokasháya) control is (effected), carelessness (Pramada ) productive of impurity also ( is caused); therefore it is really the stage careless or imperfect vow (Pramatta Virata ), ( the sixth spiritual stage).

Commentary.
The thought-activity here also is destructive-subsidential (Kshayopashama), i. e., there is destruction and subsidence of almost all the Karmic matter of the passions. Still there is the intense operation (Tibra - Udaya) of the little matter of perfect-conductpreventing and the minor passions, which has escaped [destruction and subsidence. Its effect is to partially prevent the observance of the perfect vows.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Hence the name of the stage: -imperfect vow (Pramatta Virata).
Sanjvalana Kasháyas are four, being those kinds of anger, pride, deceit and greed which prevent the vows which constitute perfect right conduct; and the minor passions (Nokasháya) are mine :
Hásya-laughter, Rati-indulgence, Arati - Ennui, Shoka-sorrow, Bhaya-fear, Jugupsá- disgust, Strí-veda-feminine inclination, Purusha-veda masculine inclination, Napumsaka-veda-common inclination.
Pramáda means carelessness in being attentive to the realisation of right-belief, right knowledge, and right conduct.
वत्तावत्तपमादे जो वसइ पमत्तसंजदो होदि। सयलगुणसीलकलिलो महव्वई चित्तलायरणो॥ ३३ ॥ व्यक्ताव्यक्तप्रमादे यो वसति प्रमत्तसंयतो भवति । सकलगुणसीलकलितो महाव्रती चित्रलाचरणः ॥ ३३॥
33. He who remains in evident (Vyakta) and nonevident (Avyakta) carelessness (Pramáda), with all the (28 Root, Múla) qualities (Guna), and calm dispositions, (Shila) has full vows (Mahávrata) and is of variegated (i.e., imperfect) conduct, i. e., the observer of imperfect vow (Pramatta Samyata).
Commentary. Evident (Vyakta) oarelessness is evident to the saint himself, and to others who may observe him. Non-evident (Avyakta) carelessness is hidden, and is known only to those who possess direct knowledge (Pratyaksha Jnána).
28 Root-qualities (Múla-guna) these are the essential qualities in a saint, even of the lowest degree, viz: 1-Five Maha-vratas- the five great vows:
(1) Ahimsa-non-injury to any of the 10 vitalities. (2) (Satya)-truth in speech, thought and deed. (3) (Asteya)-to take nothing unless and except it is given. (4) (Brahma-charya)- chastity. (5) (Parigraha--Tyága)-renunciation of worldly attachment.

2. Five (samitis)- religious observances or carefulness about:(1) (íryá) -walking, (2) Bhásá speech, (3) Eshaná, taking only pure food, and that also when it is not specially prepared for the saint, (4) (ádána-nikshepana)-handling and putting the things as water-bowl, peacock-brush, and scripture which saints may keep, (5) (Pratishthápana) - answering calls of nature.
3. Six daily duties (Aváshyaka) (1) Sámáyika-practising equanimity, (2) Vandaná obedience to perfect souls and High Saints and the Holy images, (3) (Stuti)-praising their qualities (4) Pratikramana- repentance for faults already attached to the soul, (5) Pratyákhyána-fore-thought and endeavour so that in future no faults may attach to the soul, (6) Káyotsarga-giving up attachment to the body and practising contemplation.
27
4-Self-restraint of five senses,
and seven other duties (1) not to bathe, (2) sleeping on the ground, (3) Nakedness, (4) pulling the hair out with one's own hands, (5) taking only little food once a day, (6) not to rub and cleanse the teeth, (7) taking food standing and only in hollow of the folded hands.
Variegated conduct (chitrala-ácharana.)- every thought-activity has its corresponding thought-paint (Leshyá). The pale mien of habitually studious people, and the dark red of persons in rage has been noticed in all countries and ages. A man with an unfixed conduct often changes his thought-paint or leshyá. Sri Nemi chandrácharya has used a very appropriate word, chequered or variegated to express this unfixity of conduct. This unfixity is due to carelessness (Pramáda) as described in the text.
It must be noted that all the most obvious and usual duties of saintship are discharged in this stage; for example-teaching, and preaching the scriptures, and reading and writing the books, looking after the discipline of pupils, travelling abroad, and taking food.

Commentary.
The 4 censurable talks or gossips ( Vikathás ), each being com - bined with each one of the 4 passions, gives the number 4x4 - 16 of combinations of 2 elements each. Each of these 16 being combined with each one of the 5 senses make 16x5 = 80 combinations of 3 elements each. Each one of these 80 must have sleep and attach - ment, so that the number of the combinations of 5 elements each
is 80.

37. Distribution is by placing respectively each one of 4 elements of the first class of Pramáda (gossip or Vikatha), then covering each one of these with each one of the elements of the succeeding classes.

38. Placing the elements of the first class as many times as there are elements in the second class, in each group on the top, place one by one the element of the second, do like this in all ( classes ) ( till you get the 80 combinations).

Commentary.
This distribution is as follows:
Place the 4 kinds of gossips one by one as there are 4 passions, each of the 4 gossips will have to be placed in 4 places. Each one of the 4 passions can cover the gossips in turn, thus we get 16 combinations of two elements each. All these 16 combina - tions will have to be placed 5 times so that each one of them should be covered with each one of the 5 senses, thus yielding 80 com - binations of 3 elements each. To each one of the 80 add sleep and

attachment. Thus we get 80 combinations each one of 5 elements of the five different classes of Pramáda. This can be shown visibly as follows :
V1, V2, V3, V., represent 4 Vikathá. K, to K, represent 4 Kasháya.
I to I; represent 5 Indriyas. 1,1,1,1) 1111, 1,1,1,1

This gives us 16 combinations of 3 elements each, with 11, Similarly with 12, 13, 14, and I5, we get 16 combinations each. The total is 80. Sleep and attachment are added afterwards.
Gatha 37 is exemplified as follows :IPII*I*I* I+I*T*1415 P'II*I*I* I*I*T*I*T* K'K'K'KK K ?K?K’K’

(Then) (the 1st element) of the second class changes (into its second element); (when all the elements of) the second class are also exhausted, (then the first elements of the 3rd class changes (into its second element), (till the whole of the 3rd class is also exhausted and we get 80 combinations.

41. Divide the number by the number of the elements (in the class), the remainder gives the position of the ele
ment in its class. To the quotient add one. (Divide the sum by the number of the elements in the next class, the remainder again gives the position of the element in the class. And so on). (If there is) no remainder, (it means that the element is) last (in the class) (and then) one is not added (to the quotient).
Commentary, ___For example-what are the elements in combination No. 15. To find out the Vikathá element, divide 15 by 4, the remainder is 3, therefore the Vikatha is the 3rd i. e., the seditious gossip (Ráshtri Kathá). Adding one to the quotient 3, we get 4, to find out the passion divide 4 by 4, there is no remainder, that means the last passion, i. e., greed (Lobha) ; the quotient was one ; as there was no remainder, nothing to be added to it. Divide 1 by 5. the remainder is 1. the sense element is the first, i. e., touch (sparsha). Therefore the 15th combination is one of seditious gossip,

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
greed passion, sense of touch, sleep and attachment. (V. K. I i.e. the third Vikathá, gossip; the fourth Kasháya, passion; and the first Indriya, sense).
A concrete example of it may be something like this :
A man takes part in seditious talk and is prepared to commit sedition for money so that he may go and live with his wife in his village. Here the elements of seditious gossip, greed, and the object of touch are obvious. Sleep and attachment are the two elements common to all combinations of Pramáda. They merely indicate that the soul who is affected by carelessness (Pramáda) is a mundane soul. Sleep and attachment to some extent or other, are always present in all careless mundane souls, i. e., in all souls who are not in the seventh or higher spiritual stages. This example applies to the combinations under gathas 38 and 40. Under gathas 37 and 39 the process is exactly the reverse of it. We begin the senses and finish with the gossips.
संठाविदूरा रूवं उबरीदो संगुणित सगमाणे । अवणिज्ज अकिदयं कुज्जा एमेव सव्वत्थ ॥ ४२ ॥ संस्थाप्य रूपमुपरितः संगुणित्वा स्वकमानम् । अपनीयानङ्कितं कुर्यात् एवमेव सर्वत्र ॥ ४२ ॥
42. Taking 1, multiply it by the number of the elements of the last class, substract from it the number of elements which follow in their class the element given. Do the same at all steps.
Commentary.
For example to find the number of combination, being given the elements seditious gossip, greed, and touch etc., i. e., 3rd gossip, 4th passion and 1st sense. Take 1, multiply it by 5 senses=5, substract from it 4 (i. e., the No. of senses which follow touch in their class) this gives 1. Multiply the remainder by 4 passions-4, substract from it nothing as no element follows greed in the passion class -4. Multiply 4 by 4 gossips-16; substract 1 as 1 gossip follows seditious gossip in the gossip class, the result is 15. Thus 15th is the number of this combination.

45. When (there is) mild (manda) operation of perfectright-conduct-preventing (Sanjvalana), and the minor passions (No kashaya), there arises the quality of non-carelessness (Apramatta', and by (reason of) this (quality, the soul) attains (the 7th spiritual stage) of perfect vow (Apramatta Samyata).
Commentary. The stage of perfect vows is of two kinds, ordinary perfect vow (Svasthána apramatta) and extraordinary perfect vow (Sátishaya apramatta).

नष्टाशेषप्रमादो व्रतगुणशीलावलिमण्डितो ज्ञानी। अनुपशमकः अक्षपको ध्याननिलीनो हि अप्रमत्तः॥४६ ।।
46. He, whose combinations of carelessness are all suppressed, who is adorned with the chain of the (ö great) vows, (28 root) qualities, and calm disposition, has right knowledge, is absorbed in concentration, and is not capable of ascending further on the subsidential or destructive ladder (Upashama or Ksha paka Shrení), is certainly in the ordinary Syasthána) stage of perfect (apra-matta) vows.
Commentary. This is called ordinary (Svasthána or Niratishaya), because the soul cannot rise higher from this stage; it lasts only one Antarmuhúrta; and from it the soul falls down to the 6th, and re-ascends to the 7th stage, again and again. The 6th stage also lasts one antmuhúrta.
इगवीस मोहखबणु बसमण णिमित्ताणि तिकरणाणि तहिं। पढमं अधापवत्तं करणं तु करेदि अपमत्तो ॥ ४७ ॥ एकविंशतिमोहक्षपणोपशमननिमित्तानि त्रिकरणानि तेषु । प्रथममधः प्रवृत्तं करणं तु करोति अप्रमत्तः॥४७ ॥
47. (There are) 3 (kinds of thought-activity (karana) for the destruction or subsidence of 21 sub-classes of right-conduct-deluding-Karma (cháritra moha). (These are all the 25 passions except the 4 error-feeding, Anantánubandhi passions). (He who) out of these (3), gains the first lower (thought-activity) (adhah pravritti karana,) is (in the extraordinary (sátisháya, 7th stage of) perfect vow (apramatta).
Commentary. The soul which attains the extraordinary stage of perfect vow faces, and is fit to go up either the subsidential or the destructive ladder. If he is a right believer of the subsidential-destructive kind (kshayopashama samyaktva), he will first transform the Karmic matter of the 4 error feeding passions into the remaining 21 passions; then after one antarmuhúrta, by the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes

of the right-belief-deluding Karma, he will become the second subsidential right believer (Dvitiyopashamasamyak-drishti); or by their destruction he will become the destructive-right-believer (kshayika-samyak-drishti). Then in one antarmuhurta, he would make thousands of journeys between the 6th and the 7th stages. Then would begin the thought-activity called (adhahkarana,) preparatory to going on to the subsidential or destructive ladder Note that, the destructive-right-believer (ksháyika) also can go up the subsidential ladder, if he is not advanced enough to destroy the 21 sub-classes of right-conduct-deluding Karmas.

48. Because the thought-activity of the posterior souls may become like that of the prior souls, therefore the first of the (3 kinds of) thought activity has been said to be lower thought-activity; (Adhahpravritta Karana.)
Commentary. Karana is the name of the thought-activity in which the purity of the soul increases infinite fold at every instant (Samaya). (Adhah) means lower in level. This activity is called Adhah Karanal because by it the soul on a lower level can quickly rise to the same level of purity as a soul who has gone up before.
अन्तो मुहुत्तमेत्तो तकालो होदि तत्थ परिणामा। लोगाणमसंखमिदः उवरुवरि सरिसवढिगया॥४६॥ अन्तर्मुहूर्त्तमात्रस्तत्कालो भवति तत्र परिणामाः। लोकानामसंख्यमिता उपर्युपरि सहशवृद्धिगताः ॥ ४६॥
49. The duration of this (Lower thought-activity or Adhah Karana) is one antarhmuhúrta, the thoughts in it are innumerable times the innumerable spatial units in the universe; and in the upper levels they increase in purity uniformly.

Commentary. One antaramuhúrta here means a middle (Maddhyama) Antarmuhúrta which is any length of time between 1 Avali, and 1 Samaya and 48 minutes minus 1 Samaya.
" Uniformly' means in arithmetical progression (chaya). अंतोमुत्तकालं गमिऊण अधापवत्त करणं तं । पडिसमयं सुज्झतो अपुवकरणं समल्लियइ ॥५०॥ अन्तर्मुहूर्तकालं गमयित्वा अधः प्रवृत्तकरणं तत् । प्रतिसमयं शुध्यन् अपूर्वकरणं समाश्रयति ॥५०॥
50. Having passed the Antarmuhúrta in the lower thought activity (adhah karana), becoming purer every instant, the soul takes refuge in the new thought-activity (Apúrva Karana, the 8th spiritual stage.)
एदह्मि गणहाणे विसरिस समयट्टियेहिं जीवहिं। पुवमपत्ता जमा होति अपुव्वा हु परिणामा ॥५१॥ एतस्मिन् गुणस्थाने विसदृशसमयस्थितैर्जीवैः । पूर्वमप्राप्ता यस्मात् भवन्ति अपूर्वा हि परिणामाः ॥५१॥
51. Because in this spiritual stage in the souls advanced in different points of time, there arise new thoughtactivities, which were not attained before, (therefore this spiritual stage is called new thought-activity, Apúrva Karana.) भिएणसमयट्ठियेहिं दु जीवेहि ण होदि सव्वदा सरिसो। करणेहिं एकसमयडियेहिं सरिसो विसरिसो वा ॥ ५२॥ भिन्नसमयस्थितैस्तु जीवन भवति सर्वदा सादृश्यम् । करणैरेकसमयस्थितैः सादृश्यं वैसादृश्यं वा ॥५२॥
52. In the souls advanced in different points of time there is never the sameness (of purity) of thoughtactivity. In the souls advanced at the same instant, there may or may not be sameness (of purity of) thought-activity.

53. The duration of this stage of new thoughtactivity (Apúrva Karana) (is) one antarmuhúrta; (in it) the thoughts, (are) innumerable times the innumerable spatial units of the universe; (and they) increase gradually every instant and necessarily (there is) no overlapping (Anu-krishti).
Commentary,
But here the Antarmuhúrta is less than that of the lower thought activity (adhah-karana), but the number of thoughts is greater than that in the, adhah-karana. This is possible because there are many kinds of innumerable numbers, some are greater than the other.
[See Jaina Gem Dictionary appendix - 21 kinds of Numbers ].

54. Involved (or advanced ) in such thoughts, the souls in the new thought-activity (Apúrva-Karana) are said to be really busy in the destruction or subsidence of the right-conduct-deluding Karmas, (Moha). (So it is said) by the Conquerors (Jinas) whose darkness of ignorance has been destroyed.

55 Having acquired freedom from bondage (vyuchhitti) of the Karmic matter of sleep and drowsiness (Nidra and Prachalā) and the age-karma still existing, (the souls in new-thought-activity), (Apúrva Karana) bring about the subsidence of right-conduct-deluding Karma (Moha) (and are therefore called) subsidentials (Upashamaka), but those (who) go up the destructive ladder necessarily destroy the right-conduct-deluding Karma (and are therefore called) Destructive (Kshapaka,) and (the age Karma always exists in this ascent on the destructive laider, (Kshapaka Shrení). एकाझ कालसमये संठाणादीहिं जह णिवट्ठति । ण णिवट्ठति तहावि य परिणामेहिं मिहो जेहिं ॥ ५६ ॥ एकस्मिन् कालसमये संस्थानादिभिर्यथा निवर्तन्ते । न निवर्तन्ने तथापि च परिणामैमिथो यैः॥५६॥ होति प्रणियहिणो ते पडिसमयं जेस्सिमेक्कपरिणामा। विमलयर झाण हुयवह सिहाहि णिद्दड्ढ कम्मवणा ॥ ५७॥

56-57. In one and the same instant though (the souls) differ from each other in figure, etc., yet their thoughts which do not differ are (called the Thoughts) of advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana). In these, only one thought-activity arises in each instant. (These thoughts), by the flames of the fire of very pure concentration are the consumers of the forest of Karmas.
Commentary. The number of thoughts in this stage is equal to the number of instants 'Samayas' in its duration. The advance in purity and generally, in this stage is perfectly uniform. Later souls can neither exceed nor come to the level of the prior souls.

58. In the Púrva Sparddhaka, Apúrava Sparddhaka, Bádara Krishti, Súksma Krishți, the fruition (Anubhága) of each one is infinitely less than that of the immediately preceding one. The greatest fruition in a succeeding part is infinitely less than the least fruition of the immediately preceding part, and the least fruition in any part is infinitely less than the highest fruition in the same part.
Commentary. Sparddhaka (fruition-group) is a group of molecules of Karmic matter which have the present or future capacity of fruition.
Púrva Sparddhakas means Sparddhakas found in the soul before its entry in to the 9th stage. Apúrva Sparddhakas are those molecules, the fruition of which has been enfeebled by the ti activity in this stage. Bádara Krishti is fruition-group of even a weaker degree; and Súkshma Krishti is weaker than Bádara Krishti. The Mathematics of the series (Shreni Vyavahára Ganita is as follows:---
This knowledge is necessary for calculating and ascertaining the rate, and degree of advancement in purity of thought activities in Adhah-Karana, Apúrva Karana, and Anivritti Karana stages.
1, The sum (s) of the series is called Sarva-dhana or Pada
dhana.
. 2. The number of terms (n) in the series is called Pada or Gachchha.
3. The common difference (d) is Chaya or Vishesha. 4. The first term (a) is Mukha, Adi or Prabhava. 5. The last term (1) is Antadhana or Bhúmi.
6. The middle term (m) is Madhyama dhana. It is actually the middle term, if number of terms is odd; but it the number

7. The number of terms multiplied by the first term gives the Adi-dhana (Ha).
8. The number of terms minus one, multiplied by the common difference gives the Chaya-dhana.[n-1(d.]

For details see Sanskrit commentary on gátha 49.
At all times in one instant (Samaya), the soul can have only one thought, pure or mixed. In (Adhah Karana,) a soul who enters this stage can acquire the same degree of thought-activity as that of the souls who have preceded it. The thought-activity overlaps and therefore it is called (Anukrishti). In the Apúrva-Karana, the soul who enters later can never reach the thought activity acquired by the souls who entered before. But if several souls enter at the same instant, their progress onwards may be equal or unequal. Some of them may attain purer thought-activity than the others ; but none of them can ever be overtaken by any soul who enters afterwards. In (Anivritti Karana,) even those souls who enter at the same instant advance uniformly. In this stage, the soul brings about either the subsidence or destruction of all the 21 sub-classes of passions, right-conduct-deluđing karma (Charitra Moha), except the 4 error-feeding passions, which were already transformed into these 21. But the soul has the very slightest form of greed which is the characteristic, which it has in the 10th stage. All but-passion less (Sukshma Sámparáya.).

59. As a (well)-washed red vest retains the slightest (tinge of) redness, so the thought activity with the sligthest passion of greed should be known to be (the 10th stage), All but-passionless (Súkshma kasháya or Sámparáya),
लोहं वेदंतो जीवो उवसामगो व खवगो वा । सो हम संपराओ जहखादे गुण किंथि ॥ ६०॥ अणुलोभं विदन् जीवः उपशमको व क्षपको वा । स सूक्ष्मसाम्परायो यथाख्यातेनोनः किञ्चित् ॥ ६० ॥

GO. Experiencing the slighest touch of greed, the soul is subsidential or destructive (Upashámaka or Kshapaka in his thought-activity ). He is all-but passionless (Suksma Sámparáya) and just less than in the state of) perfect (right conduct (yathākhyáa). कदकफलजुदजल वा सरए सरवाणियं व शिम्मलयं । सयलोव संतमोहो उबसंतकसायचो होदि ॥ ६१ ॥ कनकफलयुतजलं वा शरदि सरः पानीयं व निर्मलम् । सकलोपनमोह उपशान्तकषायको भवति ॥ ६१ ॥
61. Like the water with the Kataka fruit in it, or the limpid water of a pond in (Sharada-Ritu the cold season, (the thought-activity, in which all the deluding karmas (Moha arma ) have subsided is (the 11th stage) of subsided-delusion (Upasánta Kasháya or Moha).

Commentary.
Kataka is a fruit which being immersed in water makes it transparent by bringing about a subsidence of the particles of earth etc., in it Sharada Ritu-cold season-are the two months which

follow the rainy, and precede the winter season in India. They are practically the first half of winter (a season of 4 months). In the cold season all the muddy turbulence of the rains goes to the bottom, and leaves the upper water of ponds, tanks, etc., clear and transparent.
Note-that this stage is reached only by a soul who is ascending the subsidential ladder (Upashama Shreni). This is the last rung of the subsidential ladder. It is never touched by a soul who is fit to go up the destructive ladder (Kshapaka Shreni). The duration of the stage is one Antar-Muhúrta, and the soul cannot progress onwards from this stage. The subsided karmic matter of the passions rises again, and the soul must fall down from this stage.
लिस्सेसखीणमोहो फलिहामल भायणुदयसमचित्तो। खीणकसाओ भण्णादि णिग्गंथो वीयरायेहिं॥६२ ॥ निःशेषक्षीणमोहः स्फटिकामलभाजनोदकसमचित्तः । क्षीणकषायो भण्यते निर्ग्रन्थो वीतरागैः॥ ६२॥
62. That possessionless saint (Nir-grantha), all of whose deluding passions (Moha Kasháya) are destroyed, and whose thought is clear like the water kept in a pure vessel of crystal jewel is said by the non-attached (Oonquerors) (to be in the 12th stage of) destroyed-delusion, or delusionless (Kshina Kasháya).
Commentary. The soul ascending the destructive ladder (Kshapaka Shreni) comes up to this stage direct from the 10th, without touching the 11th stage. In the Antar-Muhúrta which is its duration, the thought-activity purifies the body very much, transforming the physical body into a highly refined (Parmaudárika), and at the close of this stage the soul's thought-activity destroys the three remaining destructive karmas (Ghátíya karmas) i. e., knowledge. obscuring, conation -obscuring, and obstructive karmas (Jnanávarniya, Darshaná varníya and Antaráya) and thus reaches the next stage, that of Omniscience.

64. And (is) with conation and knowledge unassisted (by the senses and mind or by subsidence-destruction of karmic matter)-such an omniscient (Kevali-Lord) with vibratory activity, as has been in the beginningless and endless scriptures said to be vibratory Omniscient (Sayogi Jina, in the 13th stage).
Commentary. The 9 perfect acquisitions are the nine kinds of purified thoughtactivities (Ksháyika Bháva) which arise from the destruction of the 4 destructive (Ghátíya) karmas. They are :
(1) Ksháyika jnána.-Purified or perfect knowledge, due to the destruction of knowledge-obscuring (jnáná-varniya) karma.
(2) Ksháyika Darshana.-Purified or perfect conation, due to the destruction of the conation obscuring (darsaná-varniya) karma.
(3) Ksháyika Dána.-- Purified or perfect charity, due to the destruction of charity-obstructive (Dánantaráya) karma.
(4) Ksháyika Labha.- Purified or perfect gain due to the destruction of gain-obstructing (Lábhántraya) karma.
(5) Ksháyika Bhoga.-Purified or perfect enjoyment of consumable objects due to the destruction of enjoyment-obstructive (Bhogántráya) karma,
(6) Ksháyika Upabhoga. - Purified or perfect enjoyment of nonconsumable objects, due to the destruction of enjoyment-obstructing (Upbhogántaráya) karma.

(7). Kshayika Virya.- Purified or perfect power, due to the destruction of power-obstructing (Víryántaráya) karma.
(8). Kshayika Samyaktva.. Purified or perfect right belief, due to the destruction of the right-belief-deluding (Darshana Moha) karma.
(9). Ksháyika Charitra, Purified or perfect right conduct, due to the destruction of right-conduct-deluding (Charitra Moha) karma.
Scriptures.-They are said to be beginningless and endless because they are co-eval with substances (Dravya); the eternal truth of which they contain in detail. The mention of the scriptures is especially appropriate here, because it is only the Arahantas, or the Adorable Lords in this stage, who give the scriptures to the world. The description of the scriptures as without beginning and end is also significant. The Arahanta sees the whole Truth and preaches it, but he adds nothing to it. The truth is perfect and has been seen, known and preached by the all-knowing in all-ages, and naturally there has been neither addition nor alteration in any of its contents hitherto, nor can there be any in the future. Truth is one for all, and for all times, and must necessarily be without beginning and without end.

On the contrary, the time (taken in shedding) is numerable-fold (less) in the same order.

Commentary.
(Nirjará). Shedding of karmic matter is either when the karma bears its fruit on maturity and falls off, (Savipáka), or when by deliberate thought-activity a karma is made to mature and fall off (Avipáka). The shedding meant in the Gatha is the antematurity shedding, due to the thought-activity of a right-believer. As right belief goes on being re-inforced by ever-increasing rectitude and purity of right conduct, the rate of shedding goes on increasing so that at each succeeding stage it increases innumerable fold. It

is easy to understand this by a rough example. A huge forest is set on fire. The setting of the fire begins the consuming of the forest, but if steadily increasing streams of oil are added to the fire from all sides, the rate of consumption would increase at an incredible rate in a very short-time and the huge forest would gradually be a heap of ashes. The forest of karmas begins to be consumed by the fire of right belief. But the consumption is swift and most concentrated when the thought-activity of right conduct is taking the soul from stage to stage till it reaches Nirvana and is absorbed for ever in its own thought-activity.
The shedding relates to all the karmas except the age-karma (áyu).
This innumerable fold intensity of the shedding appears at the time of rising from one stage into another.

(1) Sadashiva, (2) Sankhya, (H. Maskari, (4) Baudha, (5) Naiyáyika, (6) Íshwara, (7) Vaisheshika, and (8) Mandali.
Commentary. Sadashiva.-The doctrine that the soul was never actually bound by the karmas.
Sankhya.- Which holds that bondage, and liberation, happiness and misery are merely in Prakriti. They do not affect the soul or Purusha.
Maskari.- The soul after liberation can be affected by the karmas and can return to the world again.
Baudha.-They believe every thing to be transient.
Naiyayika and Vaisheshika.-Liberation means the annihilation of happiness, etc., the qualities of the soul.
ishvara:-God is always free and creates the world. Mandali.--The liberated soul has an ever-lasting upward motion.

तस चदुजुगाणमझे अविरुद्धेहि जुदजादि कम्मुदये। जीवसमासा होर्ति हु तब्भवसारिच्छ सामण्णा ॥७१ ॥ त्रसचतुर्युगलानां मध्ये अविरुद्धैर्युतजातिकर्मोदये । जीवसमासा भवन्ति हि तद्भवसादृश्यसामान्याः ॥ ७१ ॥
71. Owing to the operation of the Genus (Játi, subclass), along with four compatible sub-classes (one each of) the 4 pairs of mobile (Trasa), and immobile (Sthávara), gross (Vádara) and fine (Súkshma), developable (Paryápta) and undevelopable (Aparyápta), one-body-one-soul (Pratyeka) and one-body-many-souls (Sádhárana) subclasses of body making (Náma] karma, the soul-classes (Jiya Samása) certainly have common conotations in space and time.
Commentary. Common conotation means the sum of attributes or qualities which make up a common name, as for example animality, possession of five senses, rationality and humanity in man, because this common conotation applies to all the individuals who are found in space and are called man, it is called common conotation in space, or spatial conotation (Tiryak Sámánya or Sádrishya Sámánya).
But in any particular man, all these common attributes of man have existed in all his different conditions since he was born as a human being. A consideration of the common conotation as existing for all this time is called common conotation in time or time conotation (Úrdhvatá Sámnáya or Tadbhava Sámánya).
The genus (Játi) of mundane souls is of 5 kinds according to their possession of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 senses.
All these souls may be mobile or immobile. All the one sense souled are immobile, the rest are mobile.
(2) They may be gross or fine; all the souls are gross, only some of the one-sensed souls are fine.
(3) All the souls are either developable or not.
(4) All the souls occupy one body each, except some vegetable souls who share their body with other souls.
One and not more than one of these four pairs of distinction must be found in a soul at any time. But the 4 must be compatible;

for example mobile soul cannot be fine; nor can it occupy same body jointly with many, thus the necessity of compatability gives us 14 following soul classes as given in gatha 72.
बादरसुहमे इंदिय विति चउरिदिय असरिणसरणी य। पज्जत्तापजत्ता एवं ते चोदसा होतं ॥७२॥ वादरसूक्ष्मैकेन्द्रियद्वित्रिचतुरिन्द्रिया संज्ञिसंज्ञिनश्च । पर्याप्तापर्याप्ता एवं ते चतुर्दश भवन्ति ॥ ७२ ॥
72. The one-sensed souls, fine and gross, the 2, 3, and 4-sensed, (the five sensed), irrational and rational - all these being developable and non-developable make 14 (classes.)
Commentary, This gatha enumerates the fourteen soul-classes which may be shown thus:
(1) Fine ] One sensed. (2) Gross (3) ... ... Two sensed. Each of these may be (4) ... ... Three sensed. (1) Developable or (5) ... ... Four sensed. (2) Non-developable. (6) Irrational Five sensed. (7) Rational , ,
One-sénsed Souls are of 5 kinds- earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and vegetable-bodied. Each of these 5 kinds is fine-bodied, as well as gross-bodied.
Fine-bodied one-sensed souls of all five kinds, permeate all space in the universe. They are incapable of causing hurt to or being hurt by others. They die of themselves, when their age-Karma is worked out. They penetrate and pass through every kind of matter, howsoever gross or solid.
Gross-bodied (Vádara) souls are those that can hurt and be hurt by other gross-bodied ones.
More-than-one-sensed souls are all gross-bodied. (Vádara). See gatha 183-184.
(Sanjni and Asanjni) - The division of rational (Sanjni) and irrational (Asanjní) Souls is applicable only to the five-sensed Souls. All other Souls are irrational.

(Paryápta and Aparyápta). Souls who within one antar-muhurta, gain the capacity of fully developing the characterstics of the. body into which they are going to incarnate are called (Paryápta), while those that do not gain such capacity are called Aparyápta,

Nigoda - The group-souled vegetable kingdom is called “Nigoda'. Those multitudinous souls that have their body, nourishment, and age in common are called host-souls (Sádhárana). They take their birth together, live together and die together. Their life-span is very short.
Some of these, after having once come out of the Nigoda condition, and entered into higher forms of life, again fall back into the condition of Nigoda. These are called "Chaturgati-Nigoda”, “or " Itara-Nigoda." While those infinite souls who have so far never entered into any condition of life higher than that of. Nigoda, are called “ Nitya Nigoda."

Pratyeka Vanaspati. This is an individual-souled Vegetablebodied soul, whose body is dominated by a single soul. Pratyeka Vanaspati may be (1) Sapratishthita (host-individualsouled, (2) Apratishthita (Non-host-individual-souled.)
The first also supports various host-souls, while the second does not, and is purely individual-souled.
Generally the same vegetables which are host-individualsouled (Sapratishthia) in the beginning, become non-host-individualsouled (Aptṛatishthia) when nerves and their other distinctive features have appeared on the out-side also. Let us take an apple for example. So long as the nerves and the outer contours do not all appear, it is regarded as Sapratishțita; but when they have appeared, the host souls thriving on it, cease to exist any longer and it becomes purely individual.
But there are certain vegetables that continue to be hostindividual-souled throughout. Root vegetables may be regarded as belonging to this class.
The two kinds of Non-developable souls are:
(1). Nirvrittya-paryáptá (Pontentially developable) and Labdhyaparyápta (Absolutely Non-developable).
(2).
The first are those that are in the condition of Non-developableness for an antar-muhúrta but shall become developable afterwards, while the second are those that shall die within an antar-muhúrta without becoming so developable. Their age-duration is th part of the time of one pulse beat of a healthy person.
Trasa Pancha.- Five mobiles.
These are the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, irrational and rational five-sensed souls.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
This gatha gives us the Five hundred and seventy soul classes as shown in the table. For illustration, let us take the 10th variety. If we simply multiply it by one, irrespective of the distinction of developable, and non-developable, we get ten soul classes. If we distinguish them as developable and non-developable we shall have twenty soul classes. Again if we distinguish them as developable, potentially developable, and absolutely non-developable, we get thirty soul classes. Thus we have at the maximum thirty soul classes in the tenth variety, at the minimum ten classes, and at the medium twenty classes. Similarly, if we add all the classes in all the varieties from one to nineteen, we get at the minimum total 190, at the medium 380, and at the maximum 570 soul classes. The division of souls into 570 classes, it should be noted, is meant only for clear exposition and grasp of the different varieties of souls. Strict. ly and logically, there are only ninety-eight (98) soul classes, as shown in the following two gathas.

संखावत्तय जोणी कुम्मुण्णय वंसपत्तजोणी य । तत्थय संखावत्ते णियमा दु विवजदे गब्भो ॥८१॥ शंखावर्तकयोनिः कूर्मोन्नतवंशपत्रयोनी च । तत्रच शंखावर्ते नियमात् विवय॑ते गर्भः॥८१ ॥
81. Nucleus or womb (Yonj), (is of three kinds); conch-circled (Shankha-varta, with circular gradations like the inside of a conch), tortoise-high (Kurmonnata, high like the back of tortoise) and bamboo-leaf (Vanshapatra), (long like the leaf of a bamboo). Of these in the conch like circular nucleus, as a rule, Uterine birth.is denied.
___ Commentary. Necleus may be divided according to its form, (Akāra) or characteristic (Guna), The above 3 divisions are according to the form, and the divisions, according to characteristic, are given in Gatha 83.
There is no uterine birth in the conch-circled nucleus. It is found in goddesses and in some of the wives of (Chakravarti) Rajas.
कुम्मुण्णय जोणीए तित्थयरा दुविह चकवट्टी य । रामावि य जायंते सेसाए सेसगजणो दु॥८२॥ कूर्मोन्नतयोनौ तीर्थंकराः द्विविधचक्रवर्तिनश्च । रामा अपि च जायन्ते शेषायां शेषकजनस्तु ॥२॥
82. In the tortoise-high nucleus, Tirthankaras, the two kinds of Chakravartins and also Balbhadras are born. In the remaining (bamboo-leaf like nucleus) other human beings (are born).
Commentary. Tirthankaras-are the proclaimers of liberation and the guides on the path to it. Their number is twenty-four in each cycle of time in each of the Bharat, and Airavata-kshetras.
Chakravartins--are the monarchs of all the six parts of Bharat kshetra or Airavata kshetra. They are twelve in each cycle of time in each of the two regions.

Chakravartins are of two kinds. An Ardha Chakravartin rules over three out of 6 parts of one of the 2 Kshetras, each consisting of one árya-khanda and 5 Mlechha-khanda. Sakala Chakvartins rule over all the six parts of a Kshetra.
An Ardha-chakravarti, may be either a Náráyana or his opponent Pratináráyana. The elder brother of a Náráyana is called Baldeva or Balabhadra. In each cycle of time, there are nine Náráyanas, nine Pratináráyanas and nine Balabhadras.
In each of the two Kshetras there are 24 Tirthamkaras, 12 Chakvartins, 9 Narayanas, 9 Prati-Narayanas, and 9 Balbhadras the 63 Great men (Shalaka-Purusha), who flourish in each Avasarpini and Utsarpini, the descending and the ascending arc of the cycle of time.
जम्मं खलु संमुच्छणगब्भुवबादा दु होदि तज्जोणी। सञ्चित्तसीदसंउडसेदरमिस्सा य पत्तेयं ॥८३॥ जन्म खलु संमूर्छनगर्भोपपादास्तु भवति तद्योनयः । सचित्तशीतसंवृतसेतरामश्राश्चप्रत्येकम् ॥८३ ॥
83. Definitely, birth is (either) spontaneous (Sam. múrchchhana), uterine, (or) instantaneous (Upapáda). Their nuclei (are) (1) Living matter, (2) Cold, (3) Covered, their opposites, and the combinations of each pair.
(For details see Tattvartha sutra Chapter II, Sutra 31, 32, S.B.J. Vol. II, by Mr Jaini, pp. 70, 71, 72.).

84. For Unumbilical (Pota), Umbilical (Jaráyuja), and Incubatory (Andaja) souls, uterine birth; for Celestial and Hellish beings, instantaneous rise, (and) for the rest, spontaneous generation, have been declared. (For com. see Tatvartha sutra, S.B.J. Vol. II. Chapter II Sutra 38-35).

85. The nucleus for instantaneous rise, is non-living matter; for uterine births, the combination (of living and dead matter : (and that) for spontaneous generation is living matter, non-living matter or their combination.
उबबादे सीदुसणं सेसे सीदुसणमिस्सयं होदि । उबबादे यक्खेसु य संउड वियलेसुविउलं तु ॥८६॥ उपपादे शीतोष्णे शेषे शीतोष्णमिश्रका भवन्ति । उपपादैकाक्षेषु च संवृता विकलेषु विवृता तु ॥८६॥
86. For instantaneous rise (Upapada) cold or hot, (and) for the rest, cold, hot, or their combination; for souls who take instantaneous rise and for one-sensed beings, the covered (samvrita , and for incomplete-sensed (two to foursensed) souls, exposed (Vivrita) is (the Nucleus).
गन्भजजीवाणं पुण मिस्सं णियमेण होदि जोणी हु। सम्मुच्छणपंचक्खे वियलं वा विउल जोणी हु॥ ८७॥ गर्भजजीवानां पुनः मिश्रा नियमेन भवति योनिहि । संमूर्च्छनपंचाक्षयोः विकलं वा विवृतयोनिर्हि ॥८७॥
87. Again for the soul taking uterine-birth, the combination (of coverea and exposed) is the nucleus by rule. For the five-sensed soul of spontaneous generation, only the exposed is the nucleus like (that of) the incomplete-sensed (soul).
Commentary. The nucleus where a soul takes birth must have the following characteristics. Its matter, must be either living or non-living, or a combination of living or non-living; it must be either hot, or cold or a combination of hot and cold ; it must be either covered, or

88. Generally thus there are nine nuclei (but) in detail, there are by rule eighty-four Lakhs of Nuclei.
Commentary.
Note that all souls with 1, 2, 3, or 4 senses are necessarily born by spontaneous generation. Only the 5 sensed souls are born in all the 3 possible ways by spontaneous generacion, uterine birth, and instantaneous rise.
Note also that celestial and hellish beings are 5 sensed and born by instantaneous rise. Both are born in a covered nucleus, the celestial being born in a sort of box-bed and the hellish beings in a sort of bladder hung from the ceilings of their holes in hell.
Note also that all the egg-born souls must be five sensed although they may be with or without mind. The pigeon or dove is a five sensed being with mind. The nuclei for the hellish beings

are hot upto the first 3 parts of the fifth hell, and cold in the remaining f of the fifth, and in the 6th and 7th hells.

89. (There are ) seven lakhs ( nuclei ) ( for births) in Nitya (Nigoda), Itara ( Nigoda), and (the four) embodiments (dhátu), (earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied and air- bodied), (each); ten (lakhs) ( in individual-souled) vegetables; and only six ( lakhs) in incomplete-sensed; four (lakhs) in celestial, hellish, and sub-human (fivesensed) (each), and fourteen ( lakhs) in human.
For enumeration of the nuclei see Tat. Sutra, S. B. J. Chapter II Sutra 32.

90. Instantaneous rise appertains to celestial and hellish souls; uterine birth and spontaneous generation to human and sub-human souls ; and one (sensed ) and incomplete sensed (sub-human-souls ) have spontaneous generation (only).

of the enjoyment region (bhoga-bhúmi) (are all of Uterine birth; and developable human souls also are always of uterine birth.

69
92. Absolutely non-developable souls, by rule, never have instantaneous rise or uterine birth, while human souls of spontaneous generation are only absolutely nondevelopable.
Commentary.
Human souls of spontaneous generation are born in the armpits, womb and breasts of females in Árya Khanda, excepting those of the prime queen of a Chakravartin. They are also born in dirty places where urine, night-soil and such like things are laid. They are not visible to the human eye. There life is the shortest. They are born and they die 18 times in one pulse-beat, which is 3772nd part of a muhúrta i. e. 48 minutes.
इरया खलु संढा गर तिरिये तिरिए होंति सम्मुच्छा । संढा सुरभोगमा पुरिसिच्छी वेदगा चैव ॥ ६३॥ नैरिकाः खलु षंढा नरतिरश्चस्त्रयो भवति सम्मूर्च्छाः । पंढाः सुरभोगभूमाः पुरुषस्त्रीवेदकाश्चैव ॥ ६३ ॥
93. Hellish souls are invariably bi-sexual or hermaphrodite, and sub-human souls are (of all) the three (sexes, e. g. masculine, feminine and common); (human and subhuman) souls of spontaneous generation are of common sex; the celestial souls and the inhabitants of enjoyment region, (Bhoga-bhúmi) are either of masculine or of feminine sex.
Commentary.
Sexes are of two kinds :
(1) Sex organ and (2) sex-inclination. Sex organs are due to the operation of Angopánga, limbs and minor limbs sub-class of the

body-making karma. The sex inclination is due to the operation of the sex, (Veda) sub-class of the deluding-karma (mohaniya).
70
Celestial and hellish beings, and those born in the Bhoga-bhúmi, and those born by spontaneous generation have the sex inclination corresponding to their sex organ, but this is not essential in the rest the human and the sub-human beings.
सहमणिगोद पज्जयस्स जादस्स तदियसमयम्हि | अंगुल असंखभागं जहर मुक्कस्तयं मच्छे ॥ ६४॥ सूक्ष्मनिगोदापर्यातकस्य जातस्य तृतीय समये । अंगुला संख्यात भागं जघन्यमुत्कृष्टं मत्स्ये ॥ ६४ ॥
94: The size of the body of a fine-bodied and non-developable (Nigoda) soul in the third instant after it has taking birth in its nucleus (i. e. after its vigrahagati or passage for transmigration) is an innumerable part of one (cubic) finger (anguli). This is the minimum (bodily size). The maximum size is fonnd in the fish born in the last and the biggest ocean called Svayambhúramana of the world.
Commentary.
The body of a fine-bodied non-developable Nigoda-vegetable soul is oblong in the first instant of its birth, square in the second instant, and in the third instant it contracts and becomes circular. In the circular state the dimentions of its body are at their minimum, after the third instant it begins to grow.

(amongst the two sensed, incomplete-sensed souls) (the conch of the Svayambhúramana ocean) is twelve (Yojans long), the red Scorpion, a three-sensed soul of the Sva. yambhúramana continent is (one krosa less one (Yojana long; the Black Bee, a four sensed soul of the above continent is) one (Yojana Long) (and amongst the five sensed souls) the Great Fish (Mahá Matsya of the same ocean) (is) one thousand Yojanas (long).
Commentary. Space (Akásha) is divided into the universe (Loká-kásha) and non-universe (aloka-kásha). The unverse is divided into three parts. The upper universe, (Úrdhva Loka), the middle universe (Maddhya Loka,) and the lower world (Adhah-Loka). The upper universe and that alone contains the heavenly order (kalpavási) of celestial beings. In the centre of the middle universe there is Mount Meru. It is surrounded on all sides by Jambú Dvípa, a continent hay diameter of 1.00.000 large yojans. Jambū Dvípa is encircled by the ocean. Lavanodadhi, 2,00,000 large yojans in diameter ; this is encircled by the continent Dhátuki khanda 4,00,000 large yojans in diameter; encircled by the occan Kálo Dadhi 8,00,000 large yojans in diameter; this is encircled by the continent Pushkaravara-dvípa 16,00,000 large yojans in diamater. Puskaravara dvípa is bisected throughout by the mountain Mánu-shottara, so called because no human beings can exist beyond this mountain. Beyond Pushkaravara dvipa there are innumerable oceans and continents, the diameter of each one being double of that of its predecessor. The last continent is Svayamb-húramana and the last ocean is also called Svayambhú ramana. The last continent is divided in its middle by the mountain Svayamprabhá. The first 2 continents and the first 2 oceans have both Karma and Bhoga Bhúmis. The last ocean and half of the last continent next to the ocean have got pnly Karma Bhúmi. The rest of the oceans ard continents have only Bhoga Bhúmi.
The middle universe is the abode of 3 orders of celestial beings i.e., the residentials (Bhavanavásí). pripetatics (Vyantara) and Stellars (Jyotisha) orders, as also of the human and sub-human beings. Human and sub-humanbeings both of Karma and Bhoga Bhúmi are found in the first two oceans and the first 2) continents. i.e. up to the Manushottára. No human beings of any kind are found anywhere else in the universe. One sensed beings are found in the whole universe. 2 to 4 sensed and 5 sensed irrational beings are found

only in the first 2 oceans, first 2} continents, last continent and the last ocean. Five sensed rational human beings are found only in the first 2! continents and the first 2 oceans. Five-sensed rational subhuman beings of the Bhoga-Bhúmi type are found everywhere except the last half continent and the last ocean.
Beyond Manushottara up to the Syayamprabhá there are only 5 sensed animals with mind, only of the Bhoga Bhúmi type. In the last continent and the last ocean there are all kinds of sub-human animals of the Karma Bhúmi type.
The enormous, almost unimaginable, extent of the last of the innumerable continents and oceans is evident from the fact that Jambúdvípa the first of them is one lac yojans in diameter. Each yojan being of the larger kind which is 500 times of the smaller yojan which is equal to 4 koses or 8 miles. Thus the diamete of Jambúdvípa is 40,00,00,000 miles. This figure is doubled in a geometric-progression and it is impossible for the ordinary human mind to conceive it when we consider the dimensions of the last ocean.
The lotus in the last ocean has a stalk 1000 yojans long and 1 yojan in diameter. Its whole volume is about 750 cubic yojans. And the great fish there, is 1000 yojans long, 500 broad and 250 yojans thick.
These huge dimensions of living beings are quite in keeping with the dimensions of Swayambhú ramana samudra, the last and biggest of all the oceans in the universe. and they are quite possible and reasonable. These matters like all others, are quite plain to the Omniscient, who is the ultimate source of our knowledge about them. Here one Yojana is equal to four Krosas, or 8 miles. This is the ordinary short Yojana which is used for measuring bodies. The great Yojana which is five-hundred times greater is used in showing the measures of continents and oceans etc.

Commentary.
For example, let us suppose that the size of Anundhari is 1000 cubic finger and suppose the multiplicant is 2, then the size of Kunthu would be, that of Kána Makshiká 3-2 and that of Sikthaka matsya would be cubic finger.
It will be seen that the minimum bodily size of any developable mobile soul is only some part of cubic finger.
The method of finding out the different variations in bodily sizes between the minimum and the maximum is described in the following five gathas :

अवरुबरि इगिपदेसे जुदे असंखेजभागवड्ढीए।

102. The first stage in the innumerable-part-increase (asamkhyáta bhága-vriddhi) is reached by adding one 'spatial unit' (pradesh) to the minimum size. Further than this there is consistently an increase of one spatial unit (in every subsequent size.)
Commentary. The minimum bodily size has innumerable spatial units. From this it grows by four kinds of increase till the size in the second place (i. e. that of fine non-developable air-bodied souls) is arrived at. The increase is of six kinds namely.
1. Infinite-part increase (ananta-bhaga vriddhi). 2. Innumerable part-increase (asamkhyáta bhága vriddhi). 3. Numerable-part-increase (samkhyata bhaga vriddhi). 4. Numerable fold increase (samkhyáta guna vriddhi.) 5. Innumerable fold increase (asamkhyata guna vriddhi. 6. Infinite-fold-increase (ananta-guna vriddhi).
Besides these six, there is also a seventh increase called indescribeable (avaktavya). It operates between the end of one increase and the beginning of another.
Out of these six kinds of increases the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th increases only apply in the increase of size. The first and the last, infinite part and infinitefold increases are out of question since the spatial units of all sizes from the minimum to the maximum are not infinite but innumerable only. The process of the four increases is shown in the following gáthas.
अवरोग्गाहणमाणे जहण्णपरिमिदअसंखरासिहिदे। अवरस्सुबरि उड्ढे जेहमसंखेजभागस्स ॥१०३॥

103. The highest stage in the innumerable part (increase) is reached (when a number equal to the minimum size plus the quotient obtained by dividing the number of spatial units of the minimum size by the minimum preliminary innumerable, (Jaghanya parítá samkhyáta, a kind of innumerable) is obtained. See Gem Dict. App. B.

104-105. After adding one spatial unit to that (i. e. the last size shown in the preceding gatha) begins the indescribable-part (increase. avaktavya bhaga-vriddhi). The last stage of this (increase) is reached when a number equal to the minimum size plus the quotient obtained by dividing the minimum by the maximum numerical number minus one is obtained. By adding one to that i. e. (the last stage of indescribable increase we get) the first stage of the numerable part-increase. Above that there is a gradual increase of one (spatial unit).

79
107. The highest point (of indescribable-part-increase) is arrived at by adding the minimum (size spatial units) minus one to (the spatial units of) the mini - mum size. By adding one spatial unit to it, we get the first stage of the numerable-fold-increase (samkhyáta guna vriddhi).

108. The last stage of this increase ( is reached when a number equal to the spatial units of) the minimum (size) multiplied by the maximum number is arrived (at ). On adding one to this (measure of ) size, the first stage of indescribable fold-increase is obtained.
अवरपरित्तासंखेणवरं संगुणिय रुवपरिहीणे ।

109. The final stage of (indescribable fold-increase is reached) when the number equals the spatial units of minimum size, multiplied by the minimum preliminary innumerable (jaghanya- paritasankhyata) minus one. By adding one (more to it), the first (stage) of the innumerable fold (increase is obtained).

Further than that (that is) from four-sense developable souls (No. 52.) only three kinds of increase operate, as the innumerable fold increase (asamkhyáta guna vriddhi) is not possible in their case, as the bodily sizes of those classes are only numerical fold of each other.

117. The total kinds of bodily materials of all bodied souls are one Koda-Kodi (one hundred million, 10 m. x 10 m.), ninety-seven lacs, and fifty thousand crores.
Commentary.
Physique (Kula) is natural constitution. Its characteristics are dependant upon the kind of material molecules of which the physical (audúrika) and fluid (vaikriyika) bodies are made. The distinction of physique is due to the operation of the high and low subclasses of the family-determining Karma (Gotra Karma)-This Karma is ever operative along with the body-making, the age-determining, and the feeling Karma (Náma, Ayu, and Vedaniya).
This simultaneous co-operation is obvious. The age Karma is a sort of winding up of the whole machinery. Its existence means the existence of the age vitality. It being exhausted, the whole machinery of a particular mundane condition of existence comes to stop. The body making Karma determines the condition of existence, the genus of beings, their bodies, limbs, formation, molecular bondage, interfusion, figure, osseous structure of the body and their various functions, capacities, and effects at-rest and in-motion. The family-determining Karma (Gotra) determines the high or low class of family in which the soul takes birth. The principle of heredity seems to be recognised by Jainism here. In developing its body and senses the soul chooses and assimilates the kinds of material molecules which are in consonance with the character of the family determined for its birth by the family-determining Karma (gotra). The different sorts of constitution of the material molecules of which the physical and fluid bodies are formed are the different physiques mentioned here. A rough obvious observation may be made in this connection by seeing that the constitution of the material body of dog, deer, goat, sheep, lion, man, different kinds of women, plants,

118. As there are complete and incomplete houses, pots, cloth, and such things, similarly (mundane), souls (in their capacities) when complete or otherwise (i. e. incomplete) should be understood to be developable (Paryápta) or otherwise (non-developable Aparyápta).

आहारसरीरिंदीयपज्जत्ती आणपाणभासमायो। चत्तारि पंच छप्पि य एइंदियवियलसरणीणं ॥ ११६ ॥
आहारशरीरेन्द्रियपर्याप्तिः श्रानापान भाषामनः । चतस्रः पञ्च षडपि च एकेन्द्रियविकलसंज्ञिनाम् ।। ११६ ॥
119. (The capacity of) assimilating (the molecules of Áhára Varganá of which the external bodies are formed, capacities of forming) body and sense, (the capacity of) (breathing, the capacity of) speech and mind are the six developable capacities (paryapti). (Out of them) four, five and six belong (in their regular order) to one sensed, incomplete sensed (i.e. two, three, four and irrational five sensed) and rational (five sensed souls).
Commentary. The soul immediately after its vigrahagati i.e. passage from one incarnation to another, assimilates to itself the molecules of Áhára varganá out, ofwhich are formed its body, the senses, and breathing, of bhasa-vargana i.e. sound molecules, out of which speech is formed, and of mano-varganá or mind molecules out of which the mind organ in the shape of an eight petalled lotus within the heart is formed. The gaining of the capacity by the soul to develope the different kinds of molecules into their resultant bodily characterstics is called Paryápti or developableness. As shown above there are in all six Paryaptis out of which one-sensed souls can gain, only the first four; and the two-sensed, three-sensed, foursensed, and irrational five-sensed can gain only the first five; and only a rational five-sensed soul can gain all the six.
The difference between the first and the second Paryapti i.e. Áhara and Sharira is that while the first helps in transforming the Ahara vargáná molecules into liquid and solid forms, the second effects the formation of the trunk, flesh, blood and bones etc.
Vikalendriya, incomplete sensed, here include irrational fivesensed sculs.

120. The gaining of the capacities starts simultaneously, but the completion (of each of them), is effected gradually within the period of one antar.muhúrta, which increases in the case of each succeeding one. (Yet their total period does not exceed one antar-muhúrta),
Commentary. Whatever time is taken in the completion of the first development (assimilation, Áhára), a numerable (Sankhyata) part of it being added to it gives the time taken by the next (body Sháríra) development. A numerable (Sankhyáta) part of the time taken by body developement being added to it gives the time taken by the senses (Indriya) development. A numerable part of the time taken in sense-development being added to it gives the time for the next respiration development, and so on till the 6th. It must be noted that the most complete development of all the capacities never takes more than one antar-muhúrta This is so because there are many kinds of an Antar-muhúrta, the minimum being an ávali and 1 Samaya and the maximum, 48 minutes minus 1 Samaya.
Let Sankhyata be, S.
The value of S may be different in the 6 developments. Let antar-muhúrta be A. At the first intstant of birth, the operation of the development of body-making-Karmas begins in a developable soul. It begins to develope all the 6 or less developments simultaneously. Assimilation development takes time A to be completed.
The body development takes
A( 1+1)
Senses
Respiration
,

A( 1+ 5). Al 1 + 1 4

Each one of the six periods i.e. A to A( 1+) is an antarmuhúrta. And the total of all the six also is an antar-muhúrta.
The total - AS ( 1+5)-1 } If S is considered to be the same sankhayáta. If S is different, the total will be something else.
Now suppose S to be the minimum sankhayáta i.e. 2: and A to be the minimum antar-muhúrta i.e. one ávalí + 1 instant,

-
Then the total is equal to 20 ávalis + 20% instants. This is the minmum period of Paryapti for a developable rational soul.
The total time of the first two developments is equal to A + A( 1+1= A(2+ 1)- Pavalis +gsamayas.
According to Karma Kanda Gáthá 218 to 241, the first and only the first instant of this time is that of birth vibratory division (upapáda yogá sthána), and the rest except the last instant are the Increasing-Vibratoy-division (Ekántánuvriddhi yoga sthána). In other words there is the initiatory and minimum vibratory activity in the 1st instant; there is increasing activity for Avalis + half instant ; i.e. from the second up to the last but one instant ; and in and from the last instant onwards there is the Changing Vibratory division (Pariņáma yoga sthána). This lasts up to the last instant of one's life.

121, The completion of the Paryápties (of each class of souls) is effected by the operation of the developable body-making Karma (Paryapti Nama-Karma). So long as the body (formation capacity) is.incomplete, the soul is (called) potentially developable (nirvrittyaparyāpta).

122. The (soul) which on account of the operation of non-developable-body-making-karma (aparyápta-náma Karma) cannot complete its due capacities and dies within one (antar-muhúrta) is called absolutely non-developable (Labdhyaparyáptaka).

Commentary.
The antar-muhúrta for the life of an absolutely non-developable soul is always equal to one-eighteen of a pulsation. It should be noted that there are 3773 pulsations in one muhūrtai. e., 48 minutes in the case of a healthy man.

123. There are sixty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-six absolutely non-developable deaths (of Labdhyaparyáptaka souls) in one antar-muhúrta and (such) ephemeral births (kshudra bháva) also (are) as many.
87
Commentary.
Here the antar-muhūrta is equal to 3685 3 pulsations. Now there being eighteen births and deaths within one pulsation, there will be 66336 births and deaths in one antar-muhūrta.

124. There are eighty, sixty, forty, twenty-four, and sixty-six thousand one hundred and thirty-two (continuous emphemeral births) ( respectively) in the (two-sensed, three. sensed and four-sensed) incomplete (souls ), five-sensed and one-sensed (souls).

Commentary.
This gatha gives us the maximum number of births and deaths which a soul possessed of different senses can consecutively undergo within one antar-muhúrta. It means that the same soul cannot be born more than the prescribed number of times in the same class continuously in one antar-muhúrta, although the duration of each life will not be more than one eighteenth of pulsation.
Of the twenty-four births of a five-sensed being, there can be eighty human births, eight irrational five-sensed sub-human, and eight rational five-sensed sub-human births.

125. (Amongst one-sensed souls) there can be six hundred and twelve continuous ephemeral births in each of the (eleven) non-developable i. e. earth, water, fire, air, and Nigoda, (each of these being) gross and fine bodied, and mono-souled vegetables.
Commentary. Of the maximum number of births and deaths amongst one. sensed beings 66132, there can not be more than 6012 continuous births and deaths in each of the above eleven classes.

126. An (omniscient) vibratory soul, with bodily vibrations, with a developable-body, and subject to the operation of developable (body making-karma) is called incomplete vibratory soul (apúrna-yoga) when where is incompleteness (of development).
Commentary. When in the case of a vibratory omniscient soul the duration of age Karma is less than that of each of the other three AghátiyaKarmas, there is an over-flow of the spatial units of the soul, in order to equalize the duration of all the four Aghatiya Karmas. This over-flow occupies eight instants. In the first instant it is elongated like a stick (danda), in the second it broadens out like a door-leaf (Kapáta), in the third it spreads out up to the 3 universe encircling (pratara) atmospheres, and in the fourth it occupies the whole universe (Loka-purna). There is an immediate withdrawal backward and the stages are retraced in the same lir instants until the spatial units resume the original physical form when the over-flow onwards and the withdrawn backwards is in the

broadened "door-leaf" (Kapáta) there is what is called Audáríka Mishrakáya Yoga (physical mixed with Karmic body vibrations). In these two instants during the over-flow and the withdrawal the omniscient is called incomplete vibratory (Apürna-yogá) soul.
लद्धिपुराणं मिच्छे तत्थवि बिदिये चउत्थछट्ठे य । व्वित्तित्र्पज्जत्ती तत्थवि सेसेसु पज्जत्ती ॥ १२७॥ लब्ध्यपूर्ण मिथ्यात्वे तत्रापि द्वितीये चतुर्थषष्ठे च । निर्वृय पर्याप्तिः तत्रापि शेषेषु पर्याप्तिः ॥ १२७ ॥
89
127. Absolutely non-developable souls (are only ) in (the stage of ) wrong belief ( the first spiritual stage), Potentially developable souls in this (i. e., the first) and also in the second (downfall Sásádana), the fourth, and the sixth stages (i. e., vowless right belief Avirata Samyaktva and incomplete vow pramatta-virata). The developable souls have these as also the rest of the thirteen stages).
Commentary.
Developableness does not go beyond the thirteenth stage, as in the fourteenth stage it is not possible owing to the absence of soul vibrations.
The reason for a potentially developable soul being in the first, second and fourth spiritual stages is that during the course of transmigration (vigragati) the soul is always in one of these stages and the same stage continues after assumption of a body, till it becomes developable i. e., gains its Paryáptis. The reason for a potentially developable soul being in the sixth stage is that the spiritual man-like emanation (Aháraka sháríra) is formed in this stage only; and during the course of its formation the condition of the saint is that of potential developableness.

128. In non-developable condition, there is no Right Belief (Samayaktva) to souls in the six neither-most earths,

(the six lowest hells) ; to (the celestials whether) stellar (jyotishka)Paripatetic (vyantara) residential (Bhavanavásí) and to all females. There is no down-fall stage (Sásádana) in the nondevelopable condition of hellish souls.
Commentary. The spiritual stage (Gunasthána) present during the transition period until rebirth, (Vigrahagati) continues in the soul's nondevelopable condition for an antar-muhúrta. One who retains Samyaktva till death would not be born in the conditions detailed in the above gatha, and it is not possible to acquire Samyaktva in the non-developable condition. Thus there is no Samyaktva in the non-developable condition set out above.
One who is in the downfall stage at the time of death, never goes to hell. Thus there is no Sásádana stage in the non-developable condition.

Vitalities (Praņa). बाहिरपाणेहिं जहा तहेव अभंतरहिं पाणेहिं । पाणंति जेहिं जीवा पाणा ते होंति णिदिट्टा ॥ १२६ ॥ बाह्यप्राणैर्यथा तथैवाभ्यन्तरैः प्राणैः। प्राणन्ति यैर्जीवाः प्राणास्ते भवन्ति निर्दिष्टाः ॥ १२६ ।।
129. As by external life-forces, so also by internal life-forces (all mundane) souls have their existence, Both of these life-forces are Vitalities (prána). (This) has been laid down.
Commentary. Váhya-prána (external vitalities) - The activities of the five material senses, the body, speech, mind, respiration and age are said to be the external vitalities (Váhya or Dravyaprána). While the activity of inner consciousness or the internal motive force, which are due to the destructive-subsidence of the knowledgeobscuring and power-obstructing Karmas and to the operation of other Karmas and which are the stimulating cause of the external activities are called internal vitalities (Abhyanatara or Bháva prána). Paryápti is the attainment of the capacity of developing body, mind, speech, and the five senses, while Prána is the activity of those functionaries.

131, Mind and sense-vitalities arise by the destructive-subsidence of the power (obstructing Virya-antarāya), sensitive-knowledge obscuring (Mati jnáná varana-karma) By the operation of the body-making (Sháríra náma karma) (arise) the body, respiration and speech vitalities, and by the operation of age (Ayu karma) arises the age-vitality.
Commentary. For the production of respiration, and speech vitalities, along with the operation of the body-making karma the operation of respiration (Uchchhvás) Karma and voice (Swara) Karma are also necessary, respectively.

132. Sense, body, and age vitalities are found in both the developable and non-developable and respiration in developable (souls) only. In the developable two-sensed (souls) and others (up to five-sensed is found the speech) (vitality), while the mind vitality is found in developable rational (souls) alone.

133. Among the developables, the rationals have (all the ten vitalities while the rest (from irrational five sensed, downwards to two-sensed) (souls) have one less each (successively). The last (i. e., one-sensed) have two less (than the preceding class). Amongst the others (i. e., non-developables) (there are) seven (vitalities) in the two (i.e., the rational and irrational five-sensed (souls) and in the rest one less in each, (respectively).
Commentary.
Injury (Himsa) is defined as the deprivation through carelessness (Pramáda) of any one or more of the vitalities (Prána) of a soul. Really speaking it is the vitalities to which injury is caused, neither the soul nor the matter which encases a mundane soul is susceptible to any injury whatsoever. They are both indestructible in their essence. The degree of sin would depend upon the number of vitalities, and their comparative strength, to which injury is caused. The knowledge of the varying number of vitalities possessed by souls in their various conditions of life enables one to judge of the extent of injury he is likely to cause in his actions. The following table would prove useful.

Animate-feelings (sanjná). इह जाहि बाहियावि य जीवा पाबंति दारुणं दुक्खं । सेवंतावि य उभये ताओ चत्तारि सरणाओ ॥ १३४॥ इन याभिर्वाधिता अपि च ज वाः प्राप्नुवन्ति दारुणं दुःखम् । सेवमाना अपिच उभयस्मिन् ताशतस्त्रः संज्ञा ।। १३४॥
134. (Desires), troubled by which (mundane) souls experience severe pain in this world, and (which) even when enjoyed, (cause trouble) in both (the worlds) are four / animate-feelings (Sanjná).
Commentary. 1. Food (Áhára), 2. Fear (Bhaya), 3. Coition (Maithuna), and 4. Attachment (Parigraha), are called the four animate-feelings. They characterize all mundane souls. They are destroyed by following the Right Path. Even one-sensed souls are affected by the above feelings. Recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated this fact in case of plants.
आहारदसणेण य तस्सुबजोगेण ओमकोठाए । सादिदरुतीरणाए हवदि ह आहारलण्णा हु॥ १३५॥ आहारदशनेन च तस्योपयोगेन अवमकोष्ठेन । सानेतरोदीरणया भवति हि अाहारसंज्ञा हि ॥ १३५ ॥
135. The animate feeling for food is aroused by (external causes such as) sight of (delicious) food, attention to it (through rememberance, or on account of hearing stories relating to food), (and) an empty stomach ; (as also) by the premature operation (udírná) of Pain-feeling (Asátá-vedaniya) karma, (an internal cause).

136. The animate feeling of Fear is aroused by four (causes)-by the sight of some very fearful object, by attention towards it (through rememberance, or on account of hearing stories relating to fearful objects and incidents), by weakness of mind ; (as well as) by the premature ope. ration of fear-karma (a minor passion, and a sub-division of Right-conduct-deluding-karma, an internal cause).

137. The animate feeling of Coition is aroused by indulgence in exciting and aphorodisiac meals, by attention to it (through recollection, or hearing stories relating to sexuality), by the company of a bad character ; and by the premature operation of the sex-inclination Karma (a kind of Right-conduct-deluding-Karma, (which is an internal cause).
उवयरणदंसणेण च तस्सुबजोगेण मुच्छिदाए य । लोहस्सुदीरणाए परिग्गहे जायदे सण्णा ॥ १३८॥ उपकरणदर्शनेन च तस्योपयोगेन मूछिताये च | लोभस्योदीरणया परिग्रहे जायते संज्ञा ॥ १३८॥
138. The animate feeling of attachment is aroused by the sight of (beautiful) cbjects, by attention (being drawn towards them on account of remembrance or hearing stories relating to sensual objects), by infatuation for the acquisition of wordly possessions and by the premature operation of Greed-passion (Lobha-Kashaya, a kind of Rightconduct-deluding Karma, an internal cause).

नष्टप्रमादे प्रथमा संज्ञा न हि तत्र कारणाभावात् । शेषाः कर्मास्तित्वेनोपचारेणसन्ति न हि कार्ये ॥ १३ ॥
139. On the destruction of carelessness (pramáda, which exists till the sixth spritual stage), there remains no first animate feeling (i. e., desire for food), because of the absense of the (internal) cause; the remaining (three animate feelings) owing to the presence of their (causative) Karma, from a figurative point of view, still exist though they are not effective.
Commentary. Among the four causes of each of the four feelings, the internal cause is all-supreme. The other causes are effective only when there is the force of Karmas behind. Desire for food arises from the premature operation (Udíraná) of pain-feeling (Asátá-Vedaniya) Karma. Such operation is possible till the sixth Spiritual stage only. Therefore there is no desire for food beyond the sixth Stage. Fearminor-passion Karma operates only up to the Eighth, Sex-inclination minor-passion Karma up to the ninth, and greed-passion-Karma up to the tenth Spiritual Stage. But from the seventh stage onwards, their operation is so weak as not to disturb the meditative Saint in any manner. Thus the last three animate-feelings do not really exist beyond sixth Stage. They are said to exist only in a figurative way because the causative Karmas have not till then subsided or been destroyed.

141 Know (them to be ) the soul-quests, by means of which, or amongst which souls, as seen in scriptural knowledge, are searched for. They are fourteen.
Commentary.
A general knowledge about souls has already been imparted to us in the foregoing chapters on spiritual stages, soul-classes, developables and Vitalities. Soul-quests are intended to give us a detailed knowledge of souls.

143-144 There are eight with-interval-soul-quests (Sántara márganá). In case of) 1. Subsidential (Right belief, upashama samyaktva), 2. Slightest-(Delusion control, súkshma sámparáya samyama), 3. Assimilative(body.vibratory-activity, Aháraka-Káva-Yoga), 4. Mixed (Assimilative-body vibratory activity, Aharaka Mishra - Yoga), 5. Fluid-mixed (body-vibratory-activity, vaikriyika Mishra Yoga), 6. Absolutely non-developable human soul (Labdhyaparyáptaka Manushya), 7. Downfall belief (Sásádana samyaktva) and 8. Mixed (Belief-mishra-Samyaktva). The maximum (interval for each of these, respectively) is (1) Seven days, (2) Six months, (4) Seven years, (4) (Eight years), (5) Twelve Muhúrtas, and for (6) (7) and (8) the part of a Palya ; but the minimum (time) is one instant (samaya, for each of these).
Commentary. As a rule souls exist in each of the various soul-quests at every instant (samaya). The only exceptions to this general rule are enumerated, with their maximum and minimum intervals, in the above two gathas. For example, there may sometimes, be a total absence in the whole universe, of any soul in the Subsidential Rightbelief i. e., in the twelfth soul quest. But this absence can last at the maximum for seven days, or at the minimum for one instant, except in the case of souls in the partial-vow, and imperfect-vow (fifth and sixth) spiritual stages, when according to the following gáthá, the interval may extend to fourteen, and fifteen days, respectively.

145. But (in cases of souls) having first subsidential Right-Belief, (when) in Partial vow and Imperfect-vow, (stages), the interval of total absence should be known to be of fourteen, and fifteen days (respectively).

146. Condition of existence (Gati) is the state (of a soul), brought about by the operation of the body-condition-making (Gati-Náma-Karma) or it is the cause of the soul's passing in either of the four conditions of existence. The four kinds of the conditions of existence are 1. Hellish (Náraka) 2. Sub-human (Tiryanch), 3. Human (Manushya) and 4. Celestial (Deva).

147. Náratás (unamused, or Nárakás, Hellish) are so called because they do never like the objects, place, time and the conditions (in which they are placed), nor (do they like) each other.
Commentary. The derivative meaning of the word, náraka, hellish soul is given here. All the objects, and surroundings in hell are altogether disagreeable. The very name, "Nárata' or (Náraka) signifies that the hellish beings do not at all like the conditions of hell, nor do they like each other.

148. Tiryanchas (crooked or subhuman souls) are so called because they adopt crooked thought-activities, have open indulgence in their animate feelings, are in a very low position (as regards their body-enjoyment, etc.,) have little knowledge, and have multifarious grave demerits, मण्णंति जदो णिचं मणेण णिउणा मणुकडा जम्हा । मण्णुठभवा य सव्वे तम्हा ते माणुसा भणिदा ॥ १४६॥ मन्यन्ते यतो नित्यं मनसा निपुणा मनसोत्कटा यस्मात् । मनूद्भवाश्च सर्वे तस्मात्ते मानुषा भणिताः ॥ १४६ ॥
149. Mánushah (men) are so called because they always have discrimination, are mentally well-qualified, strong of will, and are descended from the Manus (or Kulakaras, the leaders of men).
Commentary. Manus or Kulakaras are born in the Bharata and Airavata Kshetras just at the beginning of the transformation of Bhogabhumi or enjoyment conditions into Karma-bhumi or work-condi. tions. They are sixteen in number, and one follows the other, after definite intervals. They instruct the people into the new ways of living, and hence they have been spoken of as the chief ancestors of all men. In the present age, here, Nábhi Rája was the fourteenth, his son Shri Rishabha-Deva, the first Tirthamkara, the fifteenth, and his son Bharata Chakravarti, after whom the country is called Bharat-Kshetra, was the last and the sixteenth.

150. Sub-humans are general, (Samanya), 2. Fivesensed, (Panchendriya) 3. Developable, (Paryápta), 4. Female Sex, (Yonimat) and non-developable (Aparyápta). The same (are the divisions) of human souls less the division of fivesensed, (as all human-souls are 5-sensed).

151. Devas (Celestials) are so called because they always amuse themselves with their eight heavenly acquisitions, and have shining heavenly constitutions.
Commentary. The eight heavenly acquisitions of the celestials, which are theirs by nature, are the following: -
1. Anima-this enables them to make their body very small. 2. Mahima - is the opposite of the first and helps them to extend
their badies to any dimensions. 3. Laghima-by which they can make their bodies very light. 4. Garimá by which they can make their bodies very heavy. 5. Sakáma Rúpitva- by which they can at will adopt any
forms, and any number of bodies at one time. 6. Vashitva - by which they can bring others under subjection, 7. Ishitva -- by which they can exhibit superiority. 8. Prakámya power to act as they desire.
Heavenly constitution. The constitution of celestial souls is technically called 'Vaikriyika, Sharira' Fluid-body. The celestial beings can assume any form they like. The body has no flesh, blood, and bones, and there are no filthy excretions from it. It is very lustrous.

152. The condition of Liberation (Siddha-Gati) is that in which there are no birth, dotage, death or fear, (no) miseries arising from (undesirable accompaniments, and from deprivation (of desirable objects), (no) animatefeelings, and no diseases, etc.
Commentary. The condition of liberated souls is described here. Liberation Toplies freedom from Karmic matter, which shrouds the real glory of the soul, drags it into various conditions, and makes it experience multifarious pleasures and pains. But when all the Karmas are destroyed the soul, which by nature has got an up-ward motion rises to the highest point of the Universe-the Siddha-shila and there lives for endless time in the enjoyment of its own glorious qualities unencumbered by the worldly pleasures or pains. This is the ideal condition of a soul. सामण्णा णेरइया घणअंगुल बिदियमूलगुणसेढी। बिदियादि बारदसडछत्तिदुणिजपदहिदा सेढी ॥ १५३॥
सामान्या नैरयिका घनांगुलद्वितीयमूलगुणश्रेणी। द्वितीयादिः द्वादशदशाष्टषब्रिद्विनिजपदहिता श्रेणी ॥ १५३ ॥
153. Hellish souls in all fare equal to the number of the spatial units in) (Jagat) shreņi (the universe line) multiplied by the second square root (i. e, the fourth root) of one cubic finger (ghanangula). (Hellish souls) in the second and other (i, e, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hells are in number equal to the quotient of the spatial units of the (universal) line divided by its own twelyth, tenth, eighth, sixth, third and second root (respectively).
Commentary, This gatha gives the method for calculating the number of hellish beings in total, and in each hell. The method may be illustrated thus. Suppose one cubic finger (ghanángula) to be 16 spatial units, and the universal line = 256 S. U. Then the total number of all hellish souls would be 256 x 16 - 256 X 94 - 256 X 2-512.

By universal line should be understood even where no specific mention is made, the spatial units covered by the universal line. Also in the case of other measures e.g. Jagat Pratara, Súchiangula, Ghanángula, etc., the spatial units covered by each should be understood.

155. By subtracting from all mundane, from all fivesensed, and from all such developable (five-sensed) souls, (all mundane, all five-sensed, and all developable five-sensed souls) in (all) the three conditions of existence (hellish, celestial and human), (we get the number of) general subhuman, five-sensed (sub-human) and developable (five sensed) sub-human respectively.

156. (The quotient of the spatial units in) the universal line-square (Jagatpratara) divided by (the spatial units of) six hundred square yojanas, is the number of the female sub-human beings. (The number of) the developable (five-sensed sub-human beings) subtracted from (the total number of) the five sensed (sub-human beings; would give us) the number of the non-developable (five-sensed) sub-human beings.
Commentary. The universe is 7 Rájus in breadth. The universal line is also 7 Rajus in length. It is called Jagat Shreni. Its square is called Jagat pratara-the universe surface area. A Ráju comprises innumerable yojanas. The middle part of the universe is one Ráju in breadth.

Commentary.
Ánata and the heavens above it namely Pránata, Árana, Achyuta, the nine Graiveyakas, nine Anudishas, and four Anuttaras (leaving Sarvártha siddhi), in each of these twenty-six heavens the number of celestial souls is equal to an innumerable part of a palya.

165. Subjective sense (Bhava Indriya) is the purification (or the knowing power) arising by the destructive subsidence of the sensitive-knowledge-obscuring-Karma. (It is) also, the conscious attention of the soul (Bodha), caused by it. The objective sense (Dravya Indirya) is the physical organ formed by the operation of the bodymaking-Karma (Sháríra Náma-Karma).

168. The power of cognisance (of the senses, in the souls in whom they first appear is) respectively square of twenty, eight, and ten bow lengths (dhanushas) - three thousand minus forty-six of yojanas, and eight thousand bow-lengths. It increases double fold (continuously in the case of two-sensed), to irrational (five-sensed souls ).

170. The range of Ocular Vision is one lac minus three hundred and sixty (Yojanas squared), multiplied by ten and then reduced to its square root then multiplied by nine and divided by sixty would give us the range of sight.
Commentary.
The actual calculation works like this:

The shape of the eye, ear, nose, and tongue is (respectively) like a lentil grain (Masura), the furrow in a barley grain (Yavanáli), Atimuktá Kadamba-flower) and a hoet (Kshurapra) (respectively), while the sense of touch is of various forms (Sansthána). See Tattva S. (S. B. J. Vol. II), Chapter II, 17.
Commentary. The shapes mentioned in this Gatha are of the inner part of the sense-organs.

172. (The eye, the ear, the nose and the tongue occupy spaces respectively equal to) an innumerable part of a (cubic) finger (Ghanangula), numerable fold (of the for. mer , a little more than the preceding one, and innumerable fold of the last. The last is thus equal to a numerable part of a cubic finger.
Commentary. These are the sizes only of the internal organs, and not of their protecting environments (Upakarana) which are much larger and differ in each individual.

173. The minimum (size of the organ of touch) is an innumerable part of a (cubic) finger (Ghanángula), (found) in the (absolutely) undevelopable fine Nigoda (vegetable) in the third instant after its birth. The maximum (size is found) in the Great Fish.
Commentary. This gatha is identical with gatha 94.
As the soul' entirely similar in form to and co-retensive with the body, the spatial units of the inner sense organs are the same as those of the corresponding part of the soul.

178. If we divide a square finger breadth (Pratarángula) by an innumerable number, and then divide by this quotient the square of the universal line (Jagata pratara) we obtain the total number of the 2, 3, 4 and 5 sensed (souls). The number (of the two to five sensed beings) is in a decreasing order, and the common divisor is an innymerable part of a wink (Ávali).

179. (Divide the total number of the mobiles by an innumerable part of an Ávalí. From total subtract the quotient, the balance is Bahubhága. (Divide the Bahubhága equally into these four 2, 3, 4 and 5 sensed). (The remaining) one part (i. e. The quotient) is to be treated in the above way. (Divided by an innumerable part of an Avali, from it, subtract the quotient. That will give its Bahubhága) here also give this Bahubhága (greater part) to the most numerous class and so on.
Commentary. Suppose the total of mohiles is 26,244 and an innumerable part of Avali is9 then 26244-9-2916.26244-2916-23328, this is the greater part or Bahubhága. This divided into the 4 classes gives each of them 5832.
__Now treat 2916 in the same way. 2916 : 9 - 324. 2916-324 - 2592. this is the 2nd Bahubhága, give this to the most numerous class i. e. the 2 sensed beings. Thus the total of 2 sensed beings is 5832+2592-8424. The last quotient is 324. 324-9-36. 324-36-288. this is the next Bahubhága, give it to the next most numerous class.

Therefore the 3-sensed beings are 5832+288-6120. The last quotient 369 4, 36-4-32, the next as Bahubhága. This + 5832 gives the total of the 4 sensed beings 5864. The last quotient is 4; give it to the last class. Therefore the total of 5-sensed beings is 5832+4-5836.
The grand total of the 4 totals is 26244.

180. Divide the square of the unversal line, ( Jagat Pratara) by an innumerable part of the square of a finger breadth, (pratarángula, ) ( and the result is) the total num - ber of developable 3, 2, 5 and 4 sensed. (Their respective numbers are in a) gradually decreasing order. Deduct (the number of) developables (from the total number, and the balance represents the number of) undevelopLables of the 2, 3, 4 and 5, sensed souls.
Commentary.
The process of finding out the respective number of each of the 3, 2, 5 and 4 sensed is the same as laid down in the previous Gatha No. 179. Here also the divisor is the innumerable part of an Avali.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. The embodiments kaya are of six kinds (1) earth, (2) water (3) fire (4) air, (5) vegetable and (6) mobile bodies. Souls are accordingly earth, water, fire, air and mobile vegetable bodied. Mobile beings are ealled, Trasa, from the Sanskrit root, tras, to fear, because, they have the natural inclination to move away from objects of fear. Immobiles do not behave in this manner.

182. Bodies (of earth, water, fire, and air bodied souls) exist through the operation of the earth, water, fire, and air body-making Karmas, as a rule, with their colour quadrate (including smell, taste and touch), in their (respective materials).
Commentary. Each of the above four embodiments are of four kinds. Tak ing earth into consideration we have:
1. Earth in general, sámánya Prithvi.
2. Earth-soul, Prithvi-Jiva, the soul which is in transmigratory passage, Vigrahagati, immediately before being born as earth bodied.
3. Earth bodied soul, the soul which has taken an earth-body. (Prithvi Káyika).
4 Earth-body, (Prithvi Kava). Water, fire, and air also are of the above four kinds. बादरसुहुमुदयेण य बादरसुहुमा हवंति तदेहा। घादसरीरं थूलं अघाददेहं हवे सुहमं ॥१८३॥ बादरसूक्ष्मोदयेन च बादरसूक्ष्मा भवन्ति तदेहाः। घातशरीरं स्थूलमघातदेहं भवेत् सूक्ष्मम् ॥ १८३ ॥
183. (Their bodies are gross or fine through the operation of gross and fine-body-making Karmas.) Obstructive, (gháta) -body is gross, while non-obstructive (agháta,) body is fine.

Commentary. Gháta sharira, an obstructive body is a gross body which obstructs and is obstructed by other objects. A body which neither obstructs nor is obstructed by other objects is agháta sharira nonobstructive or a fine body. A fine body can pass through any kind of matter.
Gross bodies are called destructible or obstructive because they alone can destroy each other. Fine bodies are in destructible or non-obstuctive because nothing can kill them and they can kill nothing. They die a natural death at the exhaustion of their age karma. They pervade throughout the whole universe. तदेहमंगुलस्स असंखभागस्स विंदमाणं तु।

184. (Know) thou (that) their bodies (are equal to) an innumerable part of a cubic finger. Gross bodies need support but fine bodies need no support and exist everywhere in the universe) with nothing intervening between them.
Commentary. The physical size of such souls is so small that a grain of earth, a drop of water, a tiny flame, or a breath of wind, contains numberless embodied souls.
From the smallest undevelopable fine air bodied being up to the largest developable gross earth bodied being there are 42 stages of different sizes body. For there various degrees. See table Gathas 97 to 101.
The host souls, Nigoda vegetables which derive support from the host-individual-souled vegetables are all gross-bodied and not finebodied, which need no support.

185. By the operation of the vegetable body-making Karma, souls become vegetable-bodied. (They are individual) (Pratyeka) (i. e. one body one soul) or common (Sámánya or Sádharaná i. e, one body many souls). In. dividuals (are) host (Pratisthita with common Sádhárana, parasites) or the other (i.e. non-host Apratisthita without common (Sádharána) parasites.)

186. Vegetables which grow from a root (múla), from the shoot, (Agra), (of a plant), from a joint (parva), from a bulb, (Kanda), from trunk, (Skandha),from seed (Veeja) and vegetables which have no such seed as root etc. (sammúr chhima) have been declared (to be) individual with host bodies, (Pratishthita Pratyeka), or without them, (non-host Apratishthita).
Commentary. 1. Vegetables which grow from root are such as, ginger,
turmeric, 2. Vegetables which grow from a shoot, such as a rose-plant, 3. Vegetables, etc., etc., etc., from joint are such as sugar-cane. 4. Vegetables, from bulb Kanda are such as potatoes. 5. Vegetables, from trunk are such as plaintain. 6. Vegetables, from seed are such as wheat, rice. 7. Of spontaneous growth are Sammúrchchhima such as grass. गूढसिरसंधिपव्वं सगभंगमहीरुयं च छिण्णरुहं । साहारणं सरीरं तविबरीयं च पत्तेयं ॥ १८७॥ गूढशिरासंधिपर्व समभङ्गमहीरुकं च छिन्नरुहम् । साधारणं शरीरं तद्विपरीतं च प्रत्येकम् ॥ १८७॥

are individual (non-host) in the first (Antar-muhúrta) of their birth).
117
Commentary.
Host-individual vegetables also in the beginning of their growth are non-host individual for an antar-muhúrta. Then they become host untile they are so developed that the sinews and nerves appear on them, when they again become non-host individual.

188. The vegetables in which sinews, (shirá), links, (Sandhi, and joints, ( Parva ), are unexposed, or which break clean (Samabhanga), which have no threads inside (Ahiruka) and which can grow from pieces are host bodies, while those that are reverse of these are individual (non-host). See (note to Gatha 73).
Commentary.
The term Sádhárana in the Gatha, refers to Sapratishthta Pratyeka, host individual, souled vegetables.

189. Roots, bulbs, barks, tendrils, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds when clean breaking, (Samabhanga) are host (individual souled vegetables), when not clean breaking, (they) are (non-host ) individual.
Commentary.

If a vegetable can be so broken that the two pieces at the broken parts leave no projecting threads or sinews it is called Samabhanga.

191. By the operation of the common, (sádhárana, body making karma), the Nigoda bodies become group souled. They should again be known to be of two kinds gross or fine.
Commentary. Nigoda is thus explained in the Sanskrit Tika. नि-नियता, गांभूमि, क्षेत्र, निवासमनन्तानन्त जीवानां ददातीति निगोदम् ।
That which is always the abode of infinite souls is called Nigoda.' साहारणमाहारो साहारणमाणपाणगहणं च । साहारणजीवाणं साहारणलक्खणं भाणियं ॥ १६२॥ साधारणमाहारः साधारणमानापानग्रहणं च । साधारणजीवानां साधारणलक्षणं भणितम् ॥ १६२ ॥

197. There are infinite souls which have never (so far) attained the condition of mobiles. Being thickly beset with impure thought activities, they do not leave the residence in Nigoda.
Commentary.
Although there are such souls who on account of their immense impure thought-activity, would never leave their stay in Nigoda, still the general rule that 608 souls leave Nigoda in 6 months 8 instants and other 608 human souls attain liberation must be kept in mind.

199. Excepting the mobiles in the condition of birth, (Upapáda) death bed and (Omniscient over flow) all the other mobiles do not exist out of the mobile channel. It has been said by the Conquerors.
GOMMATASARA.
Commentary.
An immobile soul out of the mobile channel, transmigrating to be born as a mobile, is during the passage, beginning from the first turn towards the mobile channel by operation of the mobile (body) making Karma, a mobile out of the mobile channel. This is Uppáda, condition prior to birth.
。
Samudgháta is the emanation of soul spatial units from the body without wholly discarding it. Seven kinds of these soul emanations are recognised in Jain philosophy, (Dravya Sangraha S.B. J. Vol. I. p. 29, and Commentary to Gatha 543).
G
Máranántika-Samudgháta (Death-bed-emanation) is the emanation, in some cases, of the soul spatial units shortly before death to the place where it is next going to incarnate. These soul units after touching their destination contract back to their former size and thereafter the soul leaves the body. If any mobile soul in the mobile channel is to take its next birth as an immobile outside the channel, and if before its death it performs the death-bed emanation, it naturally goes outside the mobile channel being a mobile.
Kevala-Samudgháta (Omniscient overflow) is the emanation, when in some cases the soul of an omniscient being, (of course a mobile,) expands throughout the whole universe, and then contracts back. This is also a case in which a mobile soul goes outside the mobile channel.
B
Trasa Náḍi (mobile channel) is the channel in the middle of the universe. It is fourteen Rájus high, one Ráju long and one Ráju broad. Mobiles are as a rule born within it alone.

200. The bodies of earth quadrates (earth, water, fire, air), of an omniscient being, (of a saint) in Aháraka (assimilative) emanation and (those) of celestials and hellish beings, do not support Nigoda bodies (Host souls.) The rest are with host souled-bodies.
Commentary. We learn from this Gatha that with the exception of the eight kinds of bodies specified above, all other bodies possess Nigoda-bodied souls.

201. The bodily figures of the earth quadrates (i. e. earth, water, fire, and air) are, (respectively speaking), (circular) like Masúr grain, (round like) a drop of water, (cylindrical like) a bundle of needles, (and oblong like) a flag. The bodies of vegetables and mobile souls are of various sorts.
Commentary, The size of the body of an earth, water, fire, and air soul is the innumerable part of a cubic finger. Therefore they are not visible as separate entities. We see them only in a mass. Take a glass of fresh water. Every drop of it is a mass of water-bodied souls which are obviously invisible to us. Under a microscope a drop of water is seen to possess many minute animal-cule. These are not waterbodied souls. Water-bodied souls have water and that alone as the matter of their bodies. These animal-culæ are two or more sensed beings which live in water.

204. The spatial. units of the universe being treated 31 times by 3 fold dispositions in the Shaláká method (is the number of) fire (bodied souls), and taking the innumerable units of universe as the common divisor (Pratibhága), (we get) the number of earth, water and air bodied souls by adding (the quotient as in Gatha 178-9).
Commentary. Let there be three numbers and call them, 'Shaláká Ráshi', 'Vira. lana Rashi' and "Deya Rashi..

1. Multiply 'Deyaráshi' by itself as many times as the Viralana and resulting number should again be multiplied by itself as many times as its number is; such kind of multiplications should be done as many times as the number of the Shaláká Ráshi. The result will give us the 1st step. 2. Take again Shaláká, Viralana, Deya, each equal to the num
found in the 1st step. The multiplication process should be repeated as in the previous step as many times as the number of the new Shaláká. This is the 2nd step.
3. The resulting number should be again dealt with as in the previous case. This would be the 3rd step.
4. This resulting number should again be similarly dealt with as many times as there are numbers in the present fourth shaláká minus the total number of the shaláká in the previous three steps.
Here in the first step, the number of innumerable spatial units of the universe should be taken to be Viralana, Deya, shaláká. The above process will give us the number of fire-bodied souls.
For finding out the number of earth-bodied souls, the number of fire-bodied souls should be divided by innumerable times the universal spatial units, and the quotient added to the number of fire-bodied souls.
For finding out the number of water-bodied souls we should add to the number of earth bodied souls, the quotient obtained by dividing the number of earth bodied by the innumerable universal spatial units. In the same manner the number of air-bodied souls should be ascertained.

Commentary.
The problem is like this:
If 16 twos multiplied by each other become 65536, what will 64 twos become by being multiplied by each other.
Here there are two sets of three figures. The first set is called the standard or 'Pramána Ráshi.' In this all the three figures are known. Thus, in the above problem "two" is the Deya Ráshi or the given basis, 16 is the Viralana or index number and 65536 is the 'Phala' or result.
The second set of the desired or Ichchhá Ráshi also consists of the same three number of which the 'Deya' is the same as in the standard or Pramána Ráshi, and the Viralana or index is given, but the third figure, that is, the Phala or result is unknown and required to be obtained. Thus in the above problem, in the desired Ráshi the Deya is 2, index is 64 and the result unknown and to be obtained. The formula, according to the gatha is as below:
216 Pannatthi 16 twos multiplied - 65536

verse, what will be the result in the terms of the spatial units of the universe, if 2 is raised to the power of the number of Halvings of the number of gross fire bodied beings.
The answer is clear. It is the number of the spatial units of the universe raised to the power of the quotient obtained by dividing the Halvings of the number of gross-bodied souls, by the Halvings of the number of spatial units of the universe.
Thus, the number of gross-fire-bodied souls is equal to innumerable into innumerable spatial units of the universe..
Similarly the number of other kinds can be obtained..

216. By the operation of the matter-maturing body (sub-class of the body making Karma) in the soul with mind, speech or body, that very capacity which is the cause of in-coming of the Karmas is vibration: (Yoga or vibratory activity of the soul).
Commentary.
Vibration (Jaga) is two kinds :
(1) Subjective vibratiqn (Bháya Yoga) i. e., by capacity itself by which the matter of mind, speech or body is set in vibration..
(2) Objective vibration (Dravya yoga) i. e., the actual vibrating of the spatial units, (Pradesha) of soul..

Karma here means molecules of Karmic matter, also molecules of no-Karmic matter i. e. the molecules (varganá) of mind, speech, and āháraka and Electric (Tai jasa) matter..

217. The tendencies of mind and speech are towards matter (which may be) truth, false, both or neither. These vibrations then take their names according to the matter (resulting) from them..
Commentary. Speech and mind vibrations may thus be analysed as below:
___ MIND VIBRATIONS. 1. True mind vibration (Satya-mano-yoga). 2. False mind vibration (Asatya mano-yoga). 3. Mixed namely both true and false mind vibration (Ubhaya
manoyoga.) 4. Neutral i. e. Neither true nor false mind Vibration (Anubhaya ___manoyoga).

Commentary. Examples of the ten truths are given below : -
1. Bhatta, Bháta in Bengal, Vantaka or (Mukudu) in Andhra, Kulu in Karnataka, and Choru in Dravida all singnify cooked rice. This is popular truth.
2. A woman who is not the Prime queen may by general conserit be called a Devi which in fact she is not. This is accepted truth.
3. The statue of Chandra-Prabha Tirthamkara represents Him, and is therefore called Chandra-Prabha. This is representative truth.
4. A man may be named Jina-Datta though he is not actually the gift of Jina as the name signifies. This is nominal truth.
5. This man is White.' The man has various hues in vario parts, eyes, hair, etc., and is not at all white. Yet he may tri called white. This is an example of figurative truth.
6. It is long. This is true comparatively and not absolutely speaking. The thing is longer than one and shorter than another. This is an example of relative truth.
7. A man may say that he is “cooking rice" even when the rice is not being actually and is only ready for being cooked. This is an example of practical truth.
8. 'Indra can over turn Jambú-dvipa.' Indra may never do like this but he possesses the power to do it and it is a possibility and hence possible truth.
9. Injunction against commissions of sins as laid down in scriptures is scriptural truth. e. g., right belief, right knowledge, and right conduct lead to Liberation.

10. The calculation Palya and Sagar is an example of illustrative truth.
Note.--That these ten parts of view have reference only to occassions where language may be ambiguous or capable of abuse or misrepresentation. Naturally the Syadvada philosophy must make a clear statement on such points; for example the word palanga means bed in Hindi, but it means a tiger in Persian; or pain in French, means bread, but in English it means trouble or suffering. If a French man asks an English man to give him "Pain” the pious son of Albion will certainly refuse to grant the request.

Commentary. The above nine kinds of speech are neither-true-nor-false, nor both mixed, in their significance. They may be illustrated as follows:
1. Come Rama. 2. Do this. 3. Give me this. 4. What is this. 5. This is my master's message. 6. I relinquish this.

7. Is this a string or serpent. 8. I wish to be such. 9. Sound which can't be reduced to letters.
Sounds altered by souls2 sensed to irrational 5-sensed are letterless. So is the speech of an omniscient vibrating souls. It proceeds without volition from the Saint, but is understood by the audience as true, and authoritative.

227. The root cause of (true and neutral) (mind and speech verily) is the operation of developable and bodymaking Karmas. And the root cause of false and
mixed (mind and speech) is the obscuring (i.e., knowledge obscuring Karma).
Commentary. When one speaks or thinks of the truth, or what is neutral, neither true-nor-false, he exercise no special effort, and the speech or thought is the result of the operation of developable, and bodymaking Karmas.
But when one speaks or thinks what is false, or both true and false, it is intentional and is due to the operation of knowledge-obscuring Karma.
In all mind and speech vibrations the operation of developable and the body-making Karmas is invariably present. But in the above statement ; the predominant cause is referred to as the root-cause.

Really speaking thought activity is not a condition precedent to speech in the case of omniscient souls. Speech flows out of them merely through the operation of the Nama-karma.

229. In (the vibratory omniscient), supreme among Conquerors, (effulgent like ) the moon, ( there is the 8 petalled) material mind (organ) by the operation of the limb-and-minor-limb (angopánga) sub-class of body making Karma; and mind vibration (is predicated of him) by the in-coming (into it) of molecules of mind matter (manovarganá).

20. Know that the words Puru, Mahat, Udära, Urála all have the one sense (of grossness), and (a body) appertaining thereto is called Audarika, Physical; and the vibration caused through this body is the Physicalbody-vibration (Áudárika káya yoga).
Commentary.
137
The external bodies of human and sub-human beings only are physical (Audárika). Therefore they alone have the physical body vibrations.

231. Know the aforesaid physical body (Áurálika or Audárika) when ( it is) in combination (with the Karmic body) to be non-developable.
The vibration caused through such connection is physical mixed vibration, (Audárika mishra yoga). Commentary.
This vibration-activity takes place only when the soul is still non-developable for an antar-muhúrta after its transmigratory passage (Vigrahagati). In developable condition this vibration is not possible ; there will then be only the physical-body-vibration.
विविहगुणइट्टिजुत्तं विक्किरियं वा हु होदि वेगुव्वं । तिस्से भवं च यं वेगुव्वियकायजोगो सो ॥ २३२॥ विविधगुणद्धियुक्तं विक्रियं वा हि भवति विगूर्वम् । तस्मिन् भवं च ज्ञेयं वैमूर्विककाप्रयोगः स ।। २३२ ।।
232. That which is (endowed) with various qualities and excellences is Vikriyá, or Vigúrva; and (a body) appertaining thereto should be known (to be fluid body, vaikriyíka Sháríra), and (the vibration) caused through (this body is) the fluid-body-vibration (Vaikriyika Káya Yoga).
Commentary.
This sort of body is found in celestials. Hellish beings also have got a kind of fluid body which is ugly and troublesome. It can also be transformed into many forms according to their desire. Hellish souls cannot make many bodies out of one, as is done by the celestials.

२३३ ॥
233. Gross fire (and) air (souls ), and 5 - sensed (rational developable (souls ) can change the form of (bodies); therefore their physical body may be said to be (sometimes) transformable (like fluid).

Commentary. This partial transformation, in size, is confined to the body . itself. The soul does not go beyond the trainsformed body; there
fore it is called Aprathak Vikriya i. e. inseparable transformation; but the 5-sensed rational human and subhumans i. e. all the beings in Bhoga-bhumi, enjoyment-region, and the Chakravartis, Lords of Bharat Kshetra can also transform their bodies into more than one and such transformation is called Prathak, i. e. separable. In this the soul extends continously into all the bodies and remains in the original body also.

234. Know the aforesaid fluid body (Vaigúrvika or Vaikriyika) when mixed (with the Karmic body), to be non-developable. The vibration caused through its connection is Fluid-mixed-vibration (Vaikriyika mishra Yoga.)
____Commentary. This vibration takes place in the undevelopable condition of the celestial and hellish beings and lasts for one Antar-muhúrta.

the saint in the sixth stage) of imperfect vows, for the sake of removing non-control, and for the destruction of doubts, and also for paying obeisance to the Conquerors (Jina), when there is an absence of both the omniscients (and saints) possessing full scriptural knowledge in his places (where he can go); and also for holy celebrations, (Kalyana), Renunciation and others happening in other regions (beyond his reach).
Commentary. By means of the Áháraka body the saint flashes through space and obtains the sight or touches the feet of an Omniscient Lord or Saint with full scriptural knowledge, and it is enough to strengthen his self control and to remove his doubt.

287. By the operation of the meritorious (sub-classes of the body-making Karma), (it) rises from the highest part of the body (i. e. skull of the Saint), free from physio. logical matter (blood etc), auspicious, without osseous structure, of perfect proportion, white, (and) one cubit (hath=24 angula) in length.

288. (It is) unpreventible (by and unpreventing any other thing in its course by reason of its extreme fineness), its minimum and the other (i.e. maximum) duration in time is one antara-muhúrta, (and) on the completion of its capacity to develope, sometimes even death (of the saint) is possible.

239. Through this the saint having doubt in himself, going near an Omniscient (or a knower of all the scriptures) assimilates or comprehends (Áharati) fine matters (i.e. the points on which he was in doubt), therefore (this) vibration (is called) Áháraka (Assimilative vibration or Áháraka yoga).

240. Know the above mentioned Áháraka (assimilative body) to be mixed (i, e, Áháraka with the physical body) till it is non-developable (aparyápta). The (Vibration) caused through it is assimilative-mixed-vibration (Áháraka Mishra Yoga).

241. Kármana (body) is Karma (bondage of 8 kinds) itself, or that produced (by operation of Karmana bodymaking) Karma. Vibration caused by it is Karmic-body vibration. (Karmana Kaya Yoga). It lasts for one, two, or three instants, (during transmigratory passage).

वैमूर्विका हार किक्रियानसमं प्रमत्तविरते ।
योगोऽपि एककाले एक एव च भवति नियमेन ॥ २४२ ॥
242. The activities of fluid and assimilative bodies (are) not simultaneous in (the saint in the stage of) imperfect vows, and also of necessity at one time there is only one kind of vibration (out of the 15 kinds) in any mundane being at any time.
Commentary.
The simultaneous manifestation of 2 kinds of yoga is some-times possible. For example, when a man is repeating a prayer with his tongue but his mind is thinking of something else, the thought is the manifestation of the mind vibration, and the repetition of the prayer that of the speech vibration. But this dual vibration is only seemingly so. At one instant there can only be one kind of vibration. The explanation would be easy to understand if we pause to try to comprehend the extremely short duration of an instant (samaya). There are innumerable instants in a wink, and what figure is meant by even the minimum innumerable, will be evident from the Appendix to Jaina Gem Dictionary. Thus the possible change of the kind of vibration from instant to instant is quicker than lightning. In one flash of lightning there can be millions, trillions, quintillions, or even more changes of vibration from mind to speech and from speech to mind. So, even to a most self-analytical and self-absorbing man this transition from vibration to vibration would be almost impossible to perceive. Then there is another thing to consider. The vibration (yoga) is that power of the soul which at the operation of the body-making karma becomes the cause of the inflow of karmic and non-karmic matter in the soul's environments. This vibration once started can last for one maximum antara-muhúrta i. e. for 48 minutes minus one instant. Before this maximum or a smaller duration of one kind of vibration has expired, another kind of vibration may set in. This also gives rise to the phenomenon of an apparent duality of vibrations. Thus the vibration may be only mind vibration, and the speech activity, i. e. repeating the prayer may be due merely to the momentun (sanskára) of the preceding speech vibration, just as a potter's wheel continues to revolve for sometime even after he ceases to move it by his stick.

यषां न सन्ति योगाः शुभाशुभाः पुण्यपापसंजनकाः । त भवन्ति अयोगिजिना अनुपमानन्तबलकलिताः ॥ २४३ ॥
243. Those in whom there are no merit or demerit, producing good or bad vibrations, are the non-vibratory Conquerors (Ayogi Jina) possessed of unparalleled and infinite power.
ओरालियवेगुठिवयाहारयतेजणामकम्मुदये। चउणोकम्मसरीरा कम्मेव य हादि कम्मइयं ॥ २४४॥ औरालिकवैगर्विकाहारकतेजोनामकर्मोदये । चतुर्नोकर्मशरीराणि कमैव च भवति कार्मणम् ।। २४४ ॥
244. The four bodies produced by the operation of the physical, fluid, assimilative and electric (Taijasa) body sub-classes of the body-making karma, are no-karma or quasi-karma, and the karmic (body produced by the operation of karmic body-sub-class of body-making karma) is the karma proper (i. e, the interwoven texture of the matter of the eight kinds of karmas.)
Commentary. Whenever a body-karma operates to set in activity the vibration power of the soul, material molecules suitable to the then bodies of the soul are drawn in i. e. attracted to inflow into the soul. The least number of bodies that a soul has is two, karmic and electrio bodies, in transmigratory passage. So that at every instant the soul is drawing in molecules both of karmic (kármana varganá ) and quasi-karmic matter of the electric body (taijasa-varganā) in transmigratory passage. When not in transmigratory passage the soul has in addition to the karmic and electric bodies the physical or fluid body also which is made of assimilative molecules (áháraka vargana). If the soul has more than one sense, it has speech also, and takes in the vocal molecules (Bhasha vargana) also. As a five sensed rational being, it assimilates mind molecules (mano-varganá) also. So that an ordinary human being at every instant of time is drawing in these 5 varganás.

परमाणुभिरनन्तैर्वर्गणासंज्ञा हि भवत्येका हि । ताभिरनन्तैर्नियमात् समयप्रबद्धो भवेदेकः ॥ २४५ ॥
245. Varganá is the name of a molecule of infinite atoms. And a unit of bondage (samaya prabaddha) is necessarily formed of such infinite (molecules).
Commentary. The infinite mentioned in this gatha is at its maximum, an infinite part of the number of liberated souls, and at its minimum. infinite times the number of souls incapable of liberation (abhavya), which is a kind of middle infinite multiplied by infinite (madhyama Anant-ánant,)
Unit of bondage is the number of karmic or quasi-karmic molecules which the soul binds to itself in one instant, (see gatha 4 of Karma Kánda).

246. The units of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha) of these (i. e, fluid and assimilative bodies) are as many times (those of physical and fluid bodies,) respectively, as an innumerable part of the base of the universe (jagat shrení.) And those of the electric duet (Taijasa and karmic bodies,) are infinite (times of that of the assimilative, and electric bodies respectively.) And (each of the five bodies) certainly advances in fineness (i. e. is finer, than its predecessor.)
Commentary. The physical is the grossest body. The fluid body has innume. rable times the atoms of the physical body and it is finer than the physical. The assimilative body has innumerable times the atoms of and is finer than the fluid body. The electric body has infinite times the atoms of, and is finer than, the assimilative body. The karmic body has infinite times the atoms of, and is finer than, the electric body.
Take the physical and electric bodies of a man. The molecules of physical body (áháraka varganá) are much grosser than the

molecules of electric matter (Taijas varganá); for each of the former kind we have an infinite number of the latter. Both the bodies are co-extensive. Therefore the matter of the electric body must be very much finer than that of the physical body. Perhaps it may be better understood by a comparison of the wave-lengths of heat and electricity. The electric waves are more numerous and shorter (that is, finer) than those of heat. So for the same length in space, we have many more and much finer wave-lengths for electricity than for heat.

body. This divided by an innumerable part of a linear finger gives the size of the unit of bondage of a fluid body. The size of fluid body divided by an innumerable part of a linear finger gives the size of a unit of bondage of assimilative body, and similarly for the electric and the Karmic body.
The extent of the unit of bondage of the physical body divided by an innumerable part of a linear finger gives the extent of a molecule of the physical body. The size of a physical molecule divided by an innumerable part of a linear finger gives the extent of a molecule of the fluid body. And so on for the molecules of assimilative, electric, and Karmic bodies.

( The naturally attendant atoms) co-exist with each atom (of Karmic and quasi-Karmic matter which binds) the soul.
(Each atom of Karmic and Quasi-Karmic matter) has an equal number of naturally attendant atoms. उक्कस्सट्ठिदिचरिमे सगसगउक्कस्ससंच होदि । पणदेहाणं वरजोगादिससामग्गिसहियाणं ॥ २५० ॥ उत्कृष्टस्थितिचरमे स्वकस्वकोत्कृष्टसंचयो भवति । पञ्चदेहानां वरयोगादिस्व सामग्रीसहितानाम् ॥ २५० ॥

Commentary.
The atoms of Karmic and quasi-Karmic matter flow into the soul at every instant, but only a few of them are shed at each instant, the others remain in bondage. Naturally at the moment of death the number of these unshed and inflowed atoms would be the maximum if the soul had the highest vibratory activity, etc.

251. In (the soul) with the above maximum (accuma - lation of) atoms, these 6 are certainly necessary, (1) the time of condition of existence (Bhaváddhá), (2) age (Ayushya ), ( 3 ) vibration ( Yoga ), ( 4 ) Passionate thought activity (Sanklesha ), ( 5 ) decrease of duration, (Apakarshana), (6) increase of duration (Utkarshana).

252. The maximum duration of the bondage of them (the five bodies is respectively) 3 Palyas, 33 Ságars, one antara-muhúrta, 66 Ságars, and the length of the duration of the particular Karmas, (in the Karmic Body).

एक समयपबद्धं बंधदि एवं उदेदि चरिमम्मि । गुणहाणीण दिवढं समयपबद्धं हवे सत्तं ॥ २५४ ॥ एकं समयप्रबद्धं बध्नाति एकमुदेति चरमे । गुणहानीनां यध समयप्रबद्धं भवेत् सत्त्वम् ॥ २५४ ॥
254. In each instant only one unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha) is bound and comes into operation. In the last (instant of the duration of any unit of bondage) (the number of) existing atoms (Satva) is one and a half times the number of Gunahánis multiplied by that unit of bondage.
Commentary. Gunahani here means Gunaháni áyáma. In the example in the note below it is evident that the number of molecules shed in the first 48 instants will respectively, be:
(1) 512, 480, 448, 416, 384, 352, 320, 288. (2) 256, 240,224, 208, 192, 176, 160, 144. (3) 128, 120, 112, 104, 96, 88,80, 72. (4) 64, 60, 56, 52,48, 44, 40, 36. (5) 32, 30, 28, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18. (6) 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.
From this it is easy to calculate that at the last instant the un shed molecules will be 71,304, and it is just a little less than 11 Gunahāni Ayama times of the unit of bondage, i. e. 1} x 8 x 6300 -75600.
णवरि य दुसरीराणं गलिदवसेसाउमेत्तठिदिबंधो। गुणहाणीण दिवटुं संचयमुदयं च चरिमम्हि ॥ २५५ ॥ नवरि च द्विशरीरयोगलितावशेषायुमात्रस्थितिबन्धः । गुणहानीनां द्वध संचयमुदयं च चरमे ।। २५५ ॥
255. But the duration of the unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha), (which is bound to the two bodies physical and fluid, is) the total length of one's age minus its length already exhausted. In the last (instant of life) the number of existing molecules is one and a half times of Gunaháni and (all of them shed by) operation. (This is necessarily so as in vigraha Gati, the soul cannot have the physical, fluid, or assimilative bodies).

Commentary.
guafa Gunáháni, (G) is the number of terms of a series the sum of which is the number of molecules of a unit of Bondage, (M.U.B.) and each term in which is half of the term immediately preceding it. Gunaháni-á-yám, (G. A.) is the number of instants (Samayas) in one Gunaháni.
नान गुणहानि nāná gunaháni is the group of gunahánis in one Unit of Bondage.
the number of gunahánis in one Unit of Bondage.
Duration of Bondage (S). Thus gunaháni-áyáma= number of gunahánis
Anyonya-bhyasta-ráshi - 2 raised to the power of
E. G. if 48 samayas is the duration of Unit of Bondage, and 6 is the number of gunahánis, then gunaháni-áyâma⇒ 8.
Here náná-gunaháni the group of 6 gunahánis.
Anyonyá bhyastaráshi here=25-64.
This minus one, being the divisor of the number of a Unit of Bondage gives us the term of the series.
E. G. if a Unit of Bondage have 6300 molecules, then the last term is
6300 64-1
-100.
Thus the series of 6 gunahánis here is.
3200+ 1600+ 800+ 400+ 200+ 100-6300.
1600
800

In the example given above, the soul which binds in one instant 6300 molecules, of a duration of 48 samayas and of 6 gunahánis, will shed 3200 molecules in the 1st 8 samayas.

Chaya
• 35+G
1st term 2 gunaháni áyáma
Thus in the 4th 8 - samayas in the above example, 400 molecules are shed. We want to find out how many molecules are shed in the 1st samaya, and by how many molecules the shedding becomes less and less in each succeeding samaya.
To find out the molecules shed in the 1st samaya, i. e., F, we apply the formula.
4M__ 4x400_4x400 1600

259–64.
Ć +1
3.48+1

To find out the chaya, (C) we employ the formula
64 64 2 x 48
Therefore the number of molecules shed in the 4th set of 8 samayas will be 64, 60, 56, 52, 48, 44, 40 and 36-400.
If in one instant, the soul binds 6300 molecules of a duration of 48 instants then they are shed as follows:

262. The four mind-vibrations (true, false, both, and neither, Satya, Asatya, Ubhaya and Anubhaya last only) for one antar-muhúrta (each). (Each one is) successively numerable times (the preceding one). Their total (i. e., of all four is) the same (i, e, an antar-muhúrta). And the four speech vibrations (are) successively numerable times of that (total of four).
Commentary. Let 2 be the Sankhyáta in this Gatha and let t be the instants of true-mind-vibration. Then we get t, 2t, 4t, 8t, as time for the 4 mind-vibrations respectively. Their total is 15t. The times of the four speech-vibrations are 30t, 60t, 120t, and 240t respectively. All these periods individually, and all the 8 or any number of them, collectively, amount to an antar-muhurta, which varies from 1Avali and 1 Samaya, to 48 minutes minus one Samaya.

263. Their total (i. e., of all the four speech-vibrations is) the same (i, e., one antar-muhúrta). The body (vibration is) numerable times (of this total). (The total number of) all the souls (having, 1, 2, and 3 vibrations) divided by (the number of instants in the total duration of all) the 3 vibrations, multiplied by the instants in the duration of each is the number of souls in each respectively.
Commentary. The time of body-vibration (Kaya-Yoga) is numerable times (30t+60t+120t+240t), equal to numerable times 450t which is equal to900t. The grand total of all three vibrations is 15t1450t+900t which is equal to 1365t.

Let the total number of souls for all three vibrations be equal to 21840. According to the above Gatha, t, the number of souls with true-mind-vibrations is 21840-1365-16.
And the numbers of souls corresponding to the above 9 classes of vibrations are, respectively, 16, 32, 64, 128, 480, 960, 1920, 3840, 14400 aggregating 21840.
From the above we can deduce the following rule. The number of souls for any 2 of the above 9 classes of vibration is in direct proportion to the number of instants in their durations.

265. Three instants, numerable winks (Avali),numerable times (i. e. numerable) winks, (are respectively the time for the above 3 kinds of vibrations). The number (of souls with body.vibration alone) divided by the total (of these three) multiplied by the instants in the time of each (give the number of souls in each). (And) respectively (they are) the least, innumerable times (this least), and numerable times this last.
Commentary. Let Sankhyáta be equal to 2. Let Asankhyáta be equal to x. Ávalí consists of Asankhyata innumerable instants. The time of Karmie vibration is 3 instants.

The use of the last word (Kamaso) in the Gatha shows that the author has based his account upon Dhavala, one of the most ancient and authoritative Jain texts, of which, so far as at present known, only one copy exists in the library of Sri Párasvánath Digambara Jain temple at Múlabidri (South Canara).

सुखदुःखसुबहुसस्यं कर्मक्षेत्रं कृषति जीवस्य । संसारदूरमर्यादं तेन कषाय इतीमं ब्रुवन्ति ॥ २८२ ॥
· 282. They (the Acharyas) call (Passion) as Kasháya, (because) it ploughs (Krishati) the field of soul's Karmas, extending to (eternal and infinite) length of mundane existence, and productive of huge crop of pleasure and pain.
Commentary. Passion is the root of the continuance of our mundane existence. Tho whole extent of mundane existence is the long long field which it ploughs. Its crops are the innumerable pleasures and pains with which every mundane form of life is always saturated. This great and incessant plougher is Passion, (Kasháya), so called because it brings about the ploughing (Karshana) of the field of Karmas.
So they call it. This connotes two things, (1) that the account of the passions here is based upon the earlier treatise Mahá-Dhavala which in its second part (Kasháya Prábhrita) deals with passions. The age of Maha-Dhavala which is the last of the trilogy, Dhavala, Jai Dhavala and Maha-Dhavala, and of which only one copy exists in Southern India in the library of the Parshvanath Temple at Múdabidri, District South Canara, is very old indeed. This great commentary was put together by the saintly disciples of Dharasenacharya who flourished about 600 or 700 years after Lord Máháyira. Thus he was a near successor to Umásvámi, author of the marvellous Tattvartha-sutra, and the most illustrious pupil of Sri Kunda-kundá-charya who is daily mentioned in thousands of Jain temples as the carrier onward of the unadulterated, authentic and authoritative tradition of the Jain Doctrines of the great Gana. dharas, (apostles) who learnt the whole, unchangeable, and eternal truth at the feet of the last Lord Mahavira Himself. The saint Nemi-chandra is constantly anxious to advert to this unbroken continuity of Jaina tradition.
The second connotation of the phrase "so they call it" is this. The author disclaims any share in the origination of what he is giving. He tells us that he is merely repeating what has been taught for ages and ages, without any addition or alteration on his part.

Or (those which) destroy (Kashanti) the thoughtactivities of right belief (Samyaktva), conduct (Cháritra). with partial (Desha,) and full (Sakala, vows), (and) ideal conduct (Yathákhyáta chárítra), (are) the passions (Kasháyas). (Their) number (is) four, sixteen, and innumerable (times the spatial units in) the universe.
163
Commentary.
The four passions are: Anger (Krodha,) Pride (Mána), Deceit (Máyá) and Greed (Lobha).
Each of these is of 4 kinds: error feeding, Anantánu-bandhî which destroys right belief; partial-vow-preventing, Apratyakhyánávarana, which destroys such right conduct as consists in the observance of partial vows; total-vow-preventing, Pratyák hánavarana which destroys such right. conduct as consists in the observance of full vows; and perfect-right-conduct preventing, Sanjvalana, which destroys ideal right conduct.

Thus there are 16 kinds of the 4 passions,
The error-feeding-passions keep us in the first spiritual stage of wrong belief Mithyátva or tend to bring us down from 4th to the 2nd stage. Partial-vow-preventing passions keep us in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stages. Total-vow-preventing-passions keep us in the 5th stage. Perfect-right-conduct-preventing-passions keep us in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th stages, and bring us back from the 11th. In the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th stages there are no passions, except in the 11th stage where they are in a quiescent form, and bring the soul back to the 10th and lower stages.
In this and the last Gatha, two etymological derivations of the word Kasháya are given. In the first, it is derived from Krisha to plough, because it ploughs the field of Karmas of which the soul reaps the fruit. In this it is derived from Kasha to destroy, because it destroys the right-belief and right conduct of the soul.

284. Anger is (deep) like a furrow in stone, or in earth; or (mild like) a line drawn in dust, or water. (They are) respectively the producers of the hellish, sub-human, human and celestial conditions of existence.
Commentary. The four illustrations in the Gatha represent the intensity of the feeling of anger and the more or less lasting impression which it produces. They do not correspond to the 4 sub-classes, errorfeeding etc., of anger because all the four degrees may appear in each one of the 16 classes. These four degrees have been called Very intense, intense, mild, very mild (Tibra-tara, Tíbra, Manda, Mand-tara) from the point of view of the degree of intensity connoted: They are also called maximum, Utkrishta ; non-maximum Anutkrishta ; non-minimum, Ajaghanya ; minimum, Jaghanya.

285, Pride is (unbending like) mountain, bone, wood, and cane, illustrating (the distinctions of) its (four) kinds, (very-intense, etc). (They are) respectively, the producers of the hellish, sub human, human and celestial conditions of existenee.

287. Greed is ( fast) like crimson colour, wheel-dirt, body (dirt,) turmeric colour. (They are respectively producers of the hellish, sub-human, human and celestial conditions of existence.
Commentary.
These four degrees of greed are according to the difficulty in getting rid of them. It is most difficult to wash out fast crimson colour, similarly the maximum kind of greed is most difficult to be freed from. And so on.

Commentary.
Some Saints. This means the saint Bhútabali, the author of Maha-Karma-Prābhrita a part of the trilogy mentioned above, i. e., Dhavala etc. The other view given first in the above Gatha is due to the saint Yati Vrishabha, the commentator of Kashaya Prábhrita.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Note. Every part is less in number than the upper one, and each is equal to innumerablex universe, because the innumerable is of varying values. The divisor is not to be taken to be the same. We have merely by way of illustration taken it as 9, and 1.

296. In hell the duration of passions, greed etc, (i.e. greed, deceit, pride and anger) is for each, one antar
muhurta, (and the total of the four also is one antar. muhúrta), (and each is) numerable times (of the preceding one). In celestial beings (the duration) of anger etc. (i.e., of anger, pride, deceit and greed, is one antar-muhúrta severally, and collectively, and is also numerable-fold of the preceding one, successively.)

297. The total of each (celestial or hellish class) divided by the total of all (the instants in the 4 passions) multiplied by the number of its own instants (gives the number of its own class).
Commentary. Let 1700 be the total of celestial beings, and the number of instants for the duration of their anger, pride, deceit and greed be 4, 16, 64 and 256 ; and let 4 be the Sankhyata.
Then 17003 (4+ 16 + 64+256)31700340 - 5,
Now, 5 multiplied by 4 is equal to 20, the celestial beings with anger; 80 with Pride; 320 with deceit; and 1280 for greed.

This shows that greed i.e., a desire for long and many enjoy. ments is common among the celestials; and anger is very rare. Similarly, it would be found that anger is most common and greed the rarest of their passions, among hellish beings.
णतिरिय लोहमायाकोहो माणो बिइंदियादिव्व । श्रावलि असंखभजा सगकालं वा समासेज ॥ २६८॥ नरतिरश्चोः लोभमायाक्रोधो मानो द्वीन्द्रियादिवत् । प्रावल्यसंख्यभाज्या: स्वककालं वा समासाद्य ॥ २९८॥
298. (The number of) humans and sub-humans with greed, deceit, anger and pride (is found by treating their total number minus the numbers of passionless) ; like 2 sensed etc., beings (in Gatha 179), by dividing by an innumerable part of a wink (Ávalí). Or (it) may be got from the instants of their duration.
Commentary, Let us illustrate how to find out the comparative number of humans affected by each passion at one instant. Let the number of total humans be
100500 y passion-less humans be ... 500 Then the number of humans with passion is ... 100000 • Let the innumerable part of an ávalí be 10. Divide 100000 by 10=10000. And 100000 - 10000=90000.
Divide 90000 equally into 4 parts, and let the quotient, 22,500, be allotted to greed, deceit, anger and pride, each. Now divide the remaining one part, 10000, again by 10, the innumerable part of an Ávali. We get 1000.
10000 -1000-9000. This should be added to the above allotment. And we find the number of humans with greed = 22500 + 9001 = 31500.
Again divide the balance 1000, by 10. We get 100.
Then 1000-100 - 900. This should be added to the second class. Then humans with deceit would be 22500 + 900=23400.
Again divide 100 by 10 - 10. 100-10=90 should be added to third class. Then humans with anger will be 22500+ 90-22590.
The balance 10 should be added to 4th class, then humans with ride will be 22500+10=22510.

It shows that if there are 100000 humans with passions, the proportion will be like this:
:
Humans with greed -31500
deceit = 23400
anger 22590
pride -22510
""

""
""
Total
100000.
Similarly we can get number of sub-humans. The second process of finding out the comparative numbers as given in the gatha is illustrated as follows:
"
Let the instants of an Antara-muhúrta of duration of all the passions be 10000 and the total number of passionate humans be 100000, and the innumerable part of an Ávalí 10.
""
Then divide 10000 instants by 10-1000. Then 10000-1000-9000. This should be divided equally into the four passions, greed, deceit, anger and pride, i. e. 9000÷4-2250. The balance 1000 should again be divided by 10, and we get 100. Then 1000-100-900, should be added to greed. Then it will be = 2250+900=3150.
""
The balance 100 should again be divided by 10. We get 10. 100-10-90. This should be added to deceit, we have then 2250+90-2340.
""
The balance 10 should again be divided by 10. We get 1. 10-1-9. This should be added to anger, we have then 2250+9-2259.
39
The remaining 1 should be added to the pride=2250+1=2251. The instants of 4 passions will be 3150 +2340 +2259 +2251-10000. Now we should find out the number of humans by rule of three. In 10000 instants there are 100000 humans, how many will there be in 3150, 2340,2259,2251, instants.

(That) by which (the soul) knows (all) the substances, (and their) attributes, and many kinds of modifications, pertaining to the three times (past, present and future), directly and indirectly, is the knowledge (Jnána) so they say. पंचेव होति णाणा मदिसुदोहीमणं च केवलयं । खयउवसमिया चउरो केवलणाणं हवे खइयं ॥ ३०॥ पञ्चैव भवन्ति ज्ञानानि मतिश्रुतावधिमनश्च केवलम् । क्षायोपशमिकानि चत्वारि केवलज्ञानं भवेत् क्षायिकम् ॥३०॥
300. Sensitive (Mati), scriptural (Shruta), visual (Avadhi), mental (Manahparyaya), and perfect (Kevala) are the five kinds of knowledge. (The first) four (are) destructive-subsidential (Kshayopashamika, i.e., they arise when there is partial destruction, partial subsidence, and partial operation of knowledge-obscuring Jnáná-varniya Karma), (and) perfect knowledge (is) destructive tksha. yika, i.e., it arises only on the destruction of the knowledgeobscuring-Karma.)
Note.-The above five are right knowledge. अण्णाणतियं होदि हुसण्णाणतियं खुमिच्छअणउदये। णवरि विभंगंणाणं पंचिंदियसारिणपुगणेव ॥ ३०१ ॥ अज्ञानत्रिकं भवति हि सद्ज्ञानत्रिकं खलु मिथ्यात्वानोदये । नवरि विभंगं ज्ञानं पञ्चेन्द्रियसंज्ञिपूर्ण एव ॥ ३०१ ॥

By the operation of wrong belief (Mithyátva), and error (feeding-passions, Anantanubandhi-Kashaya) sub-classes of deluding, (Mohaniya Karma), (the first) 3 (kinds of) right knowledge themselves certainly become the three kinds of wrong knowledge; but wrong visual (Vibhanga or Ku-avadhi is found) only in developable rational five-sensed beings.
Commentary. The 3 kinds of right knowledge also is only in five sensed rational beings. मिस्सुदये सम्मिस्सं अण्णाणतियण णाणतियमेव । संजमविसेससहिए मणपजवणाणमुदिडं ॥ ३०२ ॥ मिश्रोदये संमिश्रमज्ञानत्रयेण ज्ञानत्रयमेव । संयमविशेषसहिते मनःपर्ययज्ञानमुद्दिष्टम् ।। ३०२॥
302. By the operation of the mixed (Mishra, rightand-wrong-belief of sub-class of right-helief-deluding Karma, Darshan Moha) the 3 kinds of (right) knowledge (are) themselves mixed up with 3 (kinds of) wrong knowledge. Mental knowledge has been predicated of (saints from the 6th to 12th stage with special (self) control.
Commentary. The first stage of wrong belief (Mithyátva) is mentioned in Gatha 301, as also the second stage of downfall (sásádana) in which there is the operation of error-feeding-passions. The 3rd, mixed stage is mentioned here. The 4th stage is where right knowledge begins. In the 4th and 5th stages all the three kinds of right knowledge can be found. Mental knowledge is found only in 6th stage and onward. The first four kinds of right knowledge may thus, be found from 6th to 12th stage. Perfect-knowledge is found only in the 13th and 14th stages, and in the liberated souls. विसजंतकूडपंजरबंधादिसु विणुवएसकरणेण ।

Commentary. Right scriptural knowledge is that which keeps one engaged in the thinking and writing of truth leading to liberation of the soul ; and that which appertains to temporal matters, and onesided views is called wrong scriptural knowledge. From this spiritual point of view, all literature and teaching of matters relating to the commission, as well as the prevention and detection of offences, literature of fiction, and impossible stories, propagation of doctrines which cannot be established by logical arguments, and all light, vulgar, and obscene literature are all instances of wrong scriptural knowledge.

Commentary. In this and the 2 preceding Gathas, three kinds of wrong knowledge are described. The Gathas are merely illustrative. They roughly exemplify rather than define and distinguish 3 kinds of wrong knowledge. The point to grasp is this, that wrong knowledge is certainly as much knowledge as right knowledge. The method and means of acquisition of both are the same. The character of the scope and limitations is the same. But the result is totally different in the 2 cases. In one it is knowledge of things as they are; in the others it is not so, it is perverse, contrary or otherwise distorted. This is called wrong knowledge. For example, take the teachings of Mahabharata and Rámáyana. The outlines of the story are certainly true. But their description is some times so grotescue that it must be called perversion of truth, for instance no one can believe in the literal truth of an army of monkeys being marched against the human hosts of the proud Lord of Lanká. If the reader believes such incidents to be literally true, he would certainly have wrong scriptural knowledge.

308. Perception knowledge necessarily rises immediately on the coming together of the senses and the senseobjects (i.e., after conation, Darshana). (Perception) being acquired, the desire (to gain) more (definite knowledge) is conception (Iha).

Commentary.
Sensitive knowledge is knowledge derived through the five senses and the mind. Each one of these may be perception, conception, judgment or retention. This gives 24 sub-clauses of deter - minable objects. Indeterminate perception (Vyanjanávagraha) is only by means of senses of touch, taste, smell and hearing. Thus there are 28. Each one of these may be of the 12 kinds given in the above Gatha. Thus there are 336 classes of Sensitive knowledge.

313. Knowledge of the (whole submerged body of the) elephant at the time of perceiving (only), the tip of his trunk, or (the knowledge) of the other thing moon, and of the cow, on apprehension of the face (of a woman ), or an ox (Gavaya, a species of ox) is (illustrative of perception etc., of the hidden objects.)
Commentary.
Hidden or (anihsrita), as the name implies, is the hidden subject matter of sensitive knowledge. It is the perception etc., of the whole from a part, or of one thing from a part or whole of another. It should be noted that the subject matter here is always hidden. It is a kind of inference. It is not the knowledge of the thing known. It is rather a knowledge of something else from this knowledge. For example, when an elephant is standing submerged in water, when I look at it and I have direct knowledge only of the tip of its living trunk, I have an inferential perception of the whole body of the elephant, although I do not see it. Or when I see a beautiful face or an ox, I think of the lovely moon or the anímal cow. This reminiscence of similar qualities of beauty and cow, is knowledge of something hidden (anihsrita. )

315. They call scriptural knowledge Shruta Jnána the knowledge of another object, through an object (known by the sensitive knowledge). Of necessity (it is) preceded by sensitive knowledge. Here (knowledge) produced from words (is) primarily meant.
. Commentary, Shruta, literally means that which is heard (shru, to hear). Scriptural knowledge is of two kinds: -
1. Lettered or verbal (Aksharátmaka), 2. Letterless or nonverbal (Anakshrátmaka).
Verbal scriptural knowledge is derived from words which are composed of letters (Akshara) spoken or written; as when the eye sees the written word or the ear hears the spoken word 'SOUL,' the seeing and hearing gives us merely sensitive knowledge. What more we think about the meaning, and connotation of the word 'SOUL'is scriptural knowledge. It is called verbal scriptural know

ledge; because it is derived from our sensitive knowledge of the word Soul.
Non-verbal scriptural knowledge is derived from all kinds of sensitive knowledge, except those kinds which can be reduced to words, written or spoken. E. G., you feel cold air; the knowledge of coldness is sensitive knowledge by means of touch of the skin. If you do not like it, that is unpleasant, it is (non-verbal) scriptu knowledge. It is derived from your knowledge of feeling of cold, which cannot be reduced to a mere word, written or spoken.
Verbal scriptural knowledge is possible only in rational beings. All the irrationals (asamjní) have only non-verbal scriptural knowledge.
Their sensitive knowledge is confined to perception (Avagraha) by the 5 senses, and indeterminate preception by all, except the eye. So, the irrationals have got only 9 out of 28 divisions.
The rationals (Sanjní) have the non-verbal scriptural knowledge also. Verbal scriptural knowledge (Aksháratmaka) is also called Shabda Jnana or Shabdaja produced by words. Non-verbal (Anakshratmaka) scriptural knowledge is also called Linga-Jnána or Lingaja, produced by signs.

816. In the non-verbal (Anaksharátmaka scriptural knowledge there) are innumerable times the spatial units of universe places with 6 (fold increase;) (The number of different individual letters) in the verbal (scriptural knowledge is) 6th term, of the square index series of 2 (Dvirúpa Varga Dhára) minus one.
Commentary. 6 fold increase - (1) Increase by an infinite part (Ananta Bhága vriddhi) i. e. by adding an infinite part to the original.
2. Increase by innumerable part (Asankhyáta Bhága Vriddhi.) 3. Increase by a numerable part (Sankhyáta Bhága Vriddhi.)

4. Increase by numerable fold (Sankhyáta Guna Vriddhi) i. e. numerable times added to the former.
5. Increase by innumerable times (Asankhyáta Guna Vriddhi.) (6) Increase by infinite times (Ananta Guna Vriddhi .)
The 6th term-expression { (((((2)*)±)±) 2)= } 2 this is called Ek - atthi. In this series the basic number is 2, and the index is also 2, each term is the square of the index of the immediately preceding term. Therefore it is called Dvirúpávarga Dhárá, because all the figures in it are 2 and the indices grow in a series of two to the power two, etc. The number of twos in any term is one more than the number of the term in the series and the number of the twos in the index is the number of the term itself. Thus the fourth term has 4 twos as its index and 5 twos in all. It is called Pannátthi. It is equal to 65536.
The 5th term in the series has 5 twos in index and 6 in all. It is called Vádála. It is equal to (65536)*.
The 6th term has 6 twos in index and 7 in all. It is called Ekatthi is equal to ( 65536 ) 4. The number of different unrepeated letters (Apunurukta Akshara) and their unrepeated combinations employed in the whole of the scriptures is (Ekatthi) - 1 { (65536 ) - 1 ) -184,467,440,737,095,516,15.
Total of the repeated letters is obviously very much more than the above number.

319. Know the Paryáya knowledge to be the minimum (possessed by) a fine (completely undevelopable common soul, Nigoda ). But the distinction ( is that ) Par - yáya (knowledge) obscuring ( Karma begins to obscure ) knowledge from the next degree.
Commentary.
The meaning is that this is the minimum kind of knowledge, almost the point where knowledge entirely vanishes. In other words, this is the point from which the knowledge begins. Naturally this must be immune from the activity of Knowledge obscuring Karma.

821. (This Paryaya minimum, non-verbal, scriptural knowledge) is only in fine (completely) undevelopable common soul, (Nigoda) during the first turning, out of the three (maximum possible) turnings (in transmigration), to its last completely undevelopable (incarnation) after having been born in all its possible (mean births, 6012-minus this last one.)
Commentary. This is so, because continuous wanderings in the same absolutely lowest form of existence cause the greatest pain, and generate the most instense kind of conation and knowledge-obscuring-Karmas. By the operation of such Karmas, when the soul moves towards the last of its mean births, it has absolutely the lowest degree of conation and of sensitive and non-verbal scriptural knowledge.

326. The preceding increase having been repeated (as many times as there are spatial units) in an innumerable part of a (linear, finger, the next increase takes place one time. Certainly this is done again and again till the last increase, (i. e. every one of 6 increases is repeated an innumerable part of a linear finger before the next one is taken).
Commentary. Six fold increase may best be explained by an illustrative statementLet infinite be represented by
innumerable ,, numerable
, , 2. and let the first figure subject to increase be 48.
(1) Infinite part increase = 48 + 4 = 48 + 6 = 54. (2) Innumerable,
=- 54.51-54 + 18 - 72, (3) Numerable ,
= 72+ 7 = 72 + 36-108. (4) Numerable fold
= 108 108 x 2-108 + 216 -324, (5) Innumerable fold
= 324 + 324 x 3-324 +972-1296. (6) Infinite fold , , -1296 + 1296 x 8 --1295 + 10368 - 11664.
Thus if all the 6 kinds of increase take effect once on 48, it would amount to 11664.
Now let us see how this six-fold increase takes effect as stated in gatha 326, on the minimum scriptural knowledge called paryaya knowledge, possessed by a non-developablo tine Nigoda vegetable vide gatha 321.
The infinite part increase takes place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger (Suchiangula), thereafter the innumerable part increase takes place only once. And again the infinite part increase takes place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger, after which, the innumerable part increase shall take place a second time. Then again the infinite part increase shall happen as before, and the innumerable part increase once again. Proceeding in this manner the innumerable part increase should take place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. Then again the infinite part increase should take place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. There-after the numerable part increase

shall take place once, and the process of infinite part increase and innumerable part increase repeated as above; there-after the numerical part shall take place the second time. The process should be repeated again and again to complete the numerical part increase as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. The process of infinite part increase and innumerable part increase should again be exhausted, the same number of times as above. Then again infinite part increase shall take place as many times as there are spatial units etc., etc., etc. Thereafter the numerable fold increase shall once take place. The whole of the preceding process from the very beginning being repeated we shall have numerable fold increase a second time.
The repetition of the process should be done as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger and then we shall have the numerable fold increase the same number of times. Now again the process from the very beginning should be repeated to complete the innumerable part increase, and numerable part increase and again the innumerable part increase the same number of times, then infinite part increase should be done the same number of times, afterwards once innumerable fold increase should be done. In order to complete this innumerable fold increase the same number of times, the same process from the very beginning should be repeated the same number of times.
Now-again the process preceding the first innumerable fold increase should be repeated.
Then after making infinite part increase as many times as there are spatial units in innumerable part of a linear finger, infinite fold increase should be done once.
The number thus gained will be the last figure of the six-fold increase. This figure should be taken as the first figure for calculating the second six-fold increase. Such six-fold increases effected innumerable times, the innumerable spatial units of the universe represent the extent of Paryaya-Samása-knowledge.
For further details see Sanskrit commentary of Gommatsara. The following table will show how the repetition of increases is done. U refers to infinite part. 4 to innumerable part, 5 to numerable part, 6 to numerable fold, 7 to innumerable fold and 8 to infinite fold. The recurrence of any one or more of these figures means their repetition as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger.

327. (The six-fold increases take place innumerable times of the innumerable spatial units of the universe), In the first of the six-fold increases, there are 5 increases only. In the remaining (there) are 6 increases. The number of (Pada equal to spatial units in an innumerable, which is part of a linear finger) is the same everywhere,
Commentary, The last increased figure of the first step is taken as the first figure of the second step, and therefore there are only 5 increases in the first step, and six in all the rest.

328. In all the 6 places (series) the first (number in the first place) is (the last of the last places of series i.e., infinite fold increase (Ananta-guna vriddhi, i. e.), the figure 8 (Ashțánka). And the last is (infinite part increase) (Ananta bhága vriddhi, the figure U (urvanka). The minimum knowledge (Paryaya Jnana) is also) the figure 8 (Ashtánka, i. e., infinite fold) as the omniscient has seen.
Commentary. In the six-fold increase, the last increase is the infinite-fold, which becomes the first commencing figure of the next six-fold increase. Then the last figure of any six-fold increase will be the infinite part increase preceding the infinite-fold increase infinite part increase is called Urvanka. The minimum knowledge is also called 8 Ashţánka because it is infinite fold of the measure of degrees (Avíbhága Pratichheda) in the attribute of individuality (aguru-laghu).

330. The square of Kárdaka plus one multiplied by the cube of (Kándaka plus one) is the total number (of all the increases in one set of 6 fold increase). So it has been said by the Conquerors (Jinas).
Commentary. ___The statement in Gathas 329 and 330 may be illustrated as follows: -
Let Kándaka be represented by 2.
Then the total number of increases in one set of six-fold increases will be (2+1) x (2 + 1)* = 9x 27%D 243 (vide gatha 330).
The separate increases dealt with in Gatha 329 may be shown as below:

उत्कृष्टसंख्यमानं तन्त्रिचतुथै कचत्वारिंशत्षपश्चाशम् । सप्तदशमं च भागं गत्वा च लब्ध्यक्षरं द्विगुणम् ॥ ३३१ ॥ · 331. The minimum non-verbal knowledge (i. e., Paryáya or Labdhyakshara Jnána becomes) double when three-fourths or 41 out of 56, or 7 out of 10, of the number of maximum numerable steps, have been worked out (in the process of numberable part increase).

332. Thus the six-fold increases in the non-verbal (Anaksharátmak iscriptural knowledge) are (innumerable by innumerable spatial units of) universe. All (these are) the (kinds of irreducible class of scriptural knowledge) or (Paryaya-Samása or Paryáya series). After this I shall describe the verbal scriptural knowledge (Aksharátmaka Shruta Jnána).

333. Verbal scriptural knowledge (Arthákshara) divided (by what is got) after the last U, multiplied by (what is got) after the last U, is the verbal scriptural knowledge. This is said by the Conquerors.
Commentary. Verbal scriptural knowledge is that which is got after an infinite fold increase (Ananta-guna-vriddhi) in the result of the last . U, increase i. e. increase by infinite part. This divided by (Ekatthi --- 1) is the minimum verbal scriptural knowledge (Akshara Jnána, knowledge of a letter).

The infinite degrees (Avibhága Pratichheda) contained in one letter-knowledge divided by the degrees (Avibhága Pratichheda) of U, the highest figure of Paryaya-Samasa-knowledge is the infinite by which we have to multiply the Paryaya-Samása-knowledge to obtain verbal scriptural knowledge. This infinite is different from the infinite in the six-fold increases heretofore.
Akshara is of three kinds:(i) Capacity of possessing (minimum) verbal scriptural know
ledge, produced by the destruction-subsidence of the scriptural-knowledge obscuring-Karma. It is called letter facul
ty, Labdhyakshara. (ii) Sound produced by means of the vocal organs, lips, teeth,
tongue, palate, throat, etc., are called letter sounds,
Nirvritti Akshara. (iii) Representation of sounds by letters is the letter-representa

334, Expressible matters, (i. e., the total of knowledge as expressed by the Adorable (Ara hanta) himself in His enlightened Voice, Divyadhvani or letterless speech, Anaksharáváni) is an infinite part of inexpressible (matter, i, e., the total of all what is known to the omniscient). And only an infinite part of expressible (matter) can be digested as scriptural (knowledge).

386. The letters (Varna-Akshara) of a foot or (Pada) are (1631,83,07,888) sixteen hundred thirty four crores, eighty-three lacs and seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight.
Commentary. Foot or Pada is of 3 kinds: -
(1) Arthapada meaning foot a combination of letters which conveys some meaning as "bring fire" "Agnim Anaya."
(2) Pramana-pada, measure-foot, a fixed number of letters or syllables necessary for a particular kind of combination in prose or poetry, such as, “ I bow to the Lord Mahávíra" (namah Shri-varddha Mánáya) Here the foot, consists of letters, forming a fourth part of verse of the metre called Anushțupa.
(3) Maddhyama-Pada-middle-foot. It comprises 1634,83,07,888 letters as said in the above gatha. This pada is used as a unit of measurement, in describing the contents of the different Angas or parts of the scriptural-knowledge in gatha 350 and those which follow.

Commentary.
The intermediate grades between (Pada) and ( Sanghata) (foot and division) are Pada-Samása or foot-class. For each unit of numerable thousands, the number of letters in the middle foot is increased as many times as there are units in it, i. e. in the middle foot.

370. (Visual knowledge is called) Avadhi, because it. is limited (Avadhíyate), and it is called in the scriptures Símá jnána (bounded knowledge, because it is bounded in respect of its subject matter, Dravya, its scope in space, Kshetra, its duration in time, Kála, and its different conditions Bháva). And the Conquerors speak of visual knowledge as of (2) kinds, produced by birth (Bhavapratyaya), or by merit ( Guna-pratyaya).

371. Birth born (Bhava-pratyaya, Visual knowledge, is possessed by) celestial and hellish beings, and also by the Tirthankaras, and rises (from the destructionsubsidence of visual-knowledge-obscuring Karma), in all (parts of) the body. Merit-born (Guna-pratyaya visualknowledge is acquired) by human and sub-human beings, and rises (from the destruction-subsidence of visualknowledge-obscuring Karma in body above the navel) at the marks of conch etc. (e.g. lotus, bolt, svastika, etc.)

872. Merit-born (visual knowledge is) of 6 kinds, (1) Accompanying (Anugami), (2) stead-fast (Avasthita), (3) increasing (Vardha-mána), and their opposites, [(4) Nonaccompanying (Ananugami), (5) unsteady or changeable (Anavasthita), (6) decreasing (Hiyamāna)]. And (generally there are) 3 kinds of visual (knowledge). Partial-visual (knowledge, Deshá-vadhi), High visual (knowledge Parmávadhi) and Full visual (knowledge, Sarvá-vadhi).

देशावधश्च अवरं नरतिरश्चि भवति संयते वरम् । परमावधिः सर्वावधिः चरमशरीरस्य विरतस्य ॥ ३७४ ॥
374. The minimum of partial visual (knowledge) is (acquired by merit) by human and sub-human beings; the maximum, by the self-controlled (Sanyami saints).
___High-visual (Parmā-vadhi) and Full-visual (Sarva. vadhi) (knowledge rise only) in vowful (saints) in their last incarnation.

375. Well! partial visual (knowledge is) fallible (Pratipáti), the remaining two are in-fallible (Apràtipátí). (Souls having the) last two kinds (of visual knowledge) cannot have wrong belief or vowlessness.

376. Visual (knowledge) from its minimum to its maximum, in respect of its subject matter, (Dravya), scope (Kshetra), Time (Kala) and condition (Bhiva) knows (only) material (objects). And the Full Visual knowledge is free from the distinctions of minimum and maximum).
Commentary. Matter alone can be the object of visual knowledge. Soul mixed up with matter, namely all mundane souls, are also, therefore, knowable by it.

नोकौंदारिकसंचयं मध्यभयोगार्जितं सविस्रसोपचयम् । लोकविभक्तं जानानि अवरावधिः द्रव्यतो नियमात् ॥ ३७७ ॥
377. The collection (Sanchaya) of quasi-karmic (nokarma), physical (audárika) molecules acquired by medium vibratory activity (Yoga of the soul) with its naturally attendant (Visrasopachaya group of atoms), divided by (the innumerable spatial units of) the universe (Loka, is what) minimum visual (knowledge) necessarily knows as (its) subject matter.
Commentary. Collection here means 1, times guna-hani unit of bondage (Samaya-Prabaddha). Obviously grosser things can be the subject matter of this minimum visual knowledge. But finer matter cannot be known by this minimum visual knowledge.

878. In the third instant of the birth of fine (completely) undevelopable common (soul, Súkshma LabdhyaParyápta Nigoda) there is the minimum extent of localisation. (This is) the minimum scope in space of the visual-knowledge.
Commentary. Minimum Visual-knowledge comprehends only the objects given in the last Gatha located in the space given here. The grosser matters also to be knowable by minimum visual knowledge must not occupy more space than mentioned here.

379. We do not know the length, breadth and height in space of minimum visual (knowledge) separately. But its cubic volume (Samíkarana) is the extent in space of minimum (Visual knowledge.)
Commentary. The extent in space of the body of a fine completely undevelopable common soul in the 3rd instant from its birth being the absolute minimum cannot be reduced to its length, breadth, and height, in any linear measure which can be conprehended by the human mind. This is what is meant in the gatha.
Otherwise there are innumerable spatial-units even in the space occupied by this body, and each one of them is perfectly plain to the all-knowledge of the Omniscient.

380. The extent of the minimum localisation is an innumerable part of an ordinary finger (Utseda-angula.) And the spatial volume of it is the cube of its base (Súchí.)
अवरं तु ओहिखेत्तं उस्सेहं अंगुलं हवे जम्हा। सुहुमोगाहणमाणं उवरि पमाणं तु अंगुलयं ॥ ३८१ ॥ अवरं तु अवधिक्षेत्रमुत्सेधमङ्गलं भवेद्यस्मात् । सूक्ष्मावगाहनमानमुपरि प्रमाणं तु अङ्गल म् ॥ ३८१ ॥
381. The minimum spatial extent (Kshetra) of visual (knowledge) is (measured) by Utseda angula, because (its measure is) the extent of the space occupied by (the body of the) fine (completely undevelopalle common soul in 3rd instant of its birth.) Beyond this (the measure is by) (Pramána-angula) (equal to 500 Utsedángula),

384. For the different divisions of the subject matter (Dravya) beyond the minimum subject matter, (there) is Dhruvahára (geometric progression with a fractional common ratio). (It is) an infinite part of the liberated souls or infinite times (the number of) souls which are incapable of liberation (Abhavya).

885. Common ratio (Dhruvahira multiplied by itself as many times as the number of divisions of partial visual knowledge as regards its subject matter in the geometric series (i. e., the number of terms minus 2, is) multiplier of the karmic molecule. (This) multiplied by karmic molecule should be known to be the unit of bondage (Samaya-Prabaddha. with regard to (the subject matter of) visual knowledge.

386. An infinite part of (the number of) divisions of molecules of mind matter (mano-varganā) is the common ratio (Druvahára.) The difference between the maximum and minimum (of mind matter) plus one (are) the divisions of these molecules. (It refers to common ratio of mind molecules)..
अवरं होदि अणंतं अशंतभागेण अहियमुकस्सं । इदि मणभेदाणंतिमभागो दवम्मि धुवहारो ॥ ३८७॥ श्रवरं भवति अनन्तमनन्तभागेन अधिकमुत्कृष्टम् । इति मनोभेदानन्तिमभागो द्रव्ये ध्रुवहारः॥ ३८७॥
387. The minimum of mind-molecules is infinite (i. e. minimum mind molecule is of infinite atoms). And an infinite part of it added to it (is) its maximum. Thus an infinite part of the divisions of the mind (molecules is) the common ratio (Dhruyahàra) for the subject matter (of visual knowledge).

388-89. Although the extent of common ratio is tlie infinite part of the liberated souls, yet it is an infinite part of that multiplier of Karmic Varganá, (which is used) for the unit of bondage (Samaya-Prabaddha). And the multiplier of the (karmic molecule) is the common ratio multiplied by itself as many times as the number of divisions in partial visual knowledge minus 2.
Commentary. The highest division of partial visual knowledge will be a karmic molecule divided by common ratio (Dhruvahára) once. The lowest division will be a karmic molecule multiplied by Dhruvahára mul. tiplied by itself as many times as number of divisions of partial visual knowledge minus 2.

392. Though the number of all the (karmic) molecules is an infinite part of the liberated souls; yet it is the product of the common ratio (Dhruvahára) multiplied by itself as many times as there are divisions in high visual-knowledge (Parmà-vadhi) plus two.
परमावहिस्स भेदा सगोगाहणवियप्पहदतेऊ । इदि धुवहारं वग्गणगुणगारं वग्गणं जाणे ॥ ३६३ ॥ परमावधेर्भेदाः स्वकावगाहनविकल्पहनतेजसः । इति ध्रुवहारं वर्गणागुणकारं वर्गणां जानीहि ॥ ३६३ ॥
393. The divisions of high visual knowledge (with reference to subject matter) are the product of the number of fire-bodied souls and the divisions of the next or size of their bodies. Thus know the common ratio, (Dhruahāra), multiplier of (karmic) molecules (Vargana-Guna kàra) and the Karmic molecule (Varganá).

395-96. In the intermediate divisions (of subject matter of) the partial visual knowledge where the visual knowledge sees the electric body (Taijasa-sharíra) with its naturally attendant (atoms ), ( visrasopa-chaya ), (further on ) the karmic body with its naturally attendant atoms, (still further) the electric molecule purely. (i. e. without the naturally attendant atoms), (and then the speech molecules (alone ), ( and then ) the mind molecule only; there (the spatial scope) extends to innumerable continents and oceans (and the time i. e., the past and future into which visual knowledge can see) is innumerable years.

413. The maximum matter of the partial visual (knowledge) divided by the common ratio (Dhruváhára) is necessarily the measure of the minimum matter (Dravya) of higli visual (knowledge, parmávadhi). परमावहिस्स भेदा सगउग्गाहणवियप्पहदतऊ । चरिमे हारपमाणं जेस्स य होदि दव्वं तु ॥ ४१४ ॥ परमावधेर्भेदाः स्वकावगाहन विकल्पहततेजसः । चरमे हारप्रमाणं ज्येष्ठस्य च भवति द्रव्यं तु ॥ ४१४ ॥
41*. (The number of) fire bodied (souls) multiplied by (the number of) the kinds of their sizes (is the number of) the divisions of high visual (knowledge.) In the last ż. e., the highest (division) the measure of common ratio (Dhruvahāra) is (the measure of) matter.

(Paramánu) is (the matter of) full visual (knowledge Sarvavadhi . It (is) without divisions.
Division by the common ratio is like the flow of the Great River Ganges (from the first division of partial visual-knowledge up to full visual-knowledge)

416. (There) are as many divisions in respect of spatial extent and time in high visual knowledge as (there are) divisions in its matter. (Each division of space and time from minimum to maximum) is innumerable times (of its preceding one), in succession.
आवलिअसंखभागा इच्छिदगच्छधणमाणमेत्ताओ। देसावहिस्स खेत्ते कालेवि य होति संवग्गे ॥ ४१७॥

417. An innumerable part of a wink or (Avali) multiplied by itself as many times as the sum of the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., up to the number of the given division (of high visual knowledge, and again) multiplied by (maximum) space or time of partial visual knowledge, amounts (respectively to the spatial extent or time of the given division of high visual knowledge).
__ Commentary. For example, if we have to find the extent and time of the fifth division of high visual knowledge, then the sum of series will be-1+2+3+4+5-15. Then the extent and time of maximum partial visual knowledge multiplied 15 times by the innumerable part of an ávali, will give the extent and time of the 5th division of high visual knowledge.

418, (Again) the number of times (the innumerable part of an Ávalí is) to be multiplied, (may be obtained) by adding the number of the given division to the sum of the series upto the number (just) preceding (the given division), namely (the sum of) the terms excepting the (last) one.
Commentary. Let us take the 5th division, for example. The sum of the series upto the 4th division is 1+2+3+4-10, adding 5 to this, we get 15 as the number of times we have to multiply.

419. The maximum spatial extent of the Highest (i.e., full, Sarva) visual (knowledge) divided by the maximum spatial extent of high visual (knowledge) is the multiplier of (the spatial extent) of the Highest visual knowledge, and as regards time (the multiplier is) innumerable multiplied by innumerable spatial units of the universe.
Note--The multiplier is to be multiplied with the extent of space or time of high visual knowledge.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
halvings of the desired number (Ichchita-rashi) by the number of halvings of the given number (Deya-Ráshi) is equal to the desired number (Ichchita ráshi).
Commentary. Suppose the desired number is 256 and given number is 16. Then halvings of 256 are 8 and those of 16 are 4. 8 divided by 4 = 2.. । And 16x16= 256 the desired number. दिण्णच्छेदेणव हदलोगच्छेदेण पदधणे भजिदे। लद्धमिदलोगगुणणं परमावहिचरिमगुणगारो ॥ ४२१॥ देगच्छेदेनावहितलोकच्छेदेन पदधने भजिते । लब्धमितलोकगुणनं परमावधिचरमगुणकारः ॥ ४२१ ॥
421. Divide the number of halvings of the (spatial units of the) universe by the number of halvings of (an innumerable part of an Ávalí) Deya. By the quotient divide the sum of the series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc., upto the term represented by the desired division) Multiply the (spatial units of the) universe, by themselves as many times as the number of this last quotient (We then) get the multiplier for any division of high Visual knowledge. (The same process will apply in respect of every division) till the last one.
Commentary. Let the spatial units of universe be 256, and the innumerable part of an ávalí be 16. We have to find out the multiplier of its third division. The halvings of 256 are 8; and those of 16 are 4. Now 8:4 2 . The sum of series 1+2+3-6. And 6:-2-3. Therefore 2563 is the number by which the extent and time of maximum partial visual knowledge will be multiplied to gain the extent and time of third division of high visual knowledge.

423. ( From the beginning of partial visual knowledge) up to the Highest visual knowledge, the process is to multiply each division by an innumerable part of an Ávalí successively (to get the modifications (Bháva) of the following division). The number of steps is the same as (in the increase of) matter (Dravya), (and) modifications (Bháva).

433-34. Having taken down the spatial units of the extent (of the visual knowledge) of each of the heavenly beings in turn and the number of Karmic molecules of visual-knowledge-obscuring Karma without their natural attendant atoms (Visrasopachaya), (the molecules) should be divided by the common ratio (Dhruvahára) as many times as the number of the spatial units of each group in turn are exhausted. The last part in each is the subject matter of the visual knowledge corresponding to each of them.

485-36. (The duration of time of the visual knowledge) of the heavenly beings in Saudharma and íshána is innumerable crore years, in the upper four heavens (Sanat-kumára, Máhendra, Brahma and Brahmottara), an innumerable part of a Palya Then from the heaven (Lántava) up to Sarvártha-siddhi, the measure of time is little less than one Palya with proper variations.

437. The said spatial extent of the visual (knowledge) of (residential, peripatetics) up to the stellars is not regular cube; and of the heavenly beings (it is) of unequal length, (i.e., oblong). And (in men, subhuman and hellish beings the spatial extent is cubic.
Commentary. The heavenly beings can never see by means of visual know.. ledge in the upper direction beyond the highest point of their own particular mansion in heavens. चिंतियमचिंतियं का अद्धं चिंतियमणेयभेयगयं । मणपज्जवंति उच्चइ जं जाणइ तं खु णरलोए ॥ ४३८॥ चिन्तितमचिन्तितं वा अर्द्ध चिन्तितमनेक भेदगतम् । मनःपर्यय इत्युच्यते यजानाति तत्खलु नरलोके ॥ ४३८॥
438. That is called the mental (knowledge, Manah Paryáya), which knows whatever has, about various (matters), been thought (in the past), or has not been thought (i. e., will be thought in the future), or is half thought (by other rational souls) within the human region, (2} continents up to the mountain Mánushottara).

439. And mental knowledge is of two kinds, simple (mental knowledge Rijumati), and complex (mental knowledge Vipulamati). Simple is of 3 kinds necessarily, (as knowing) subject matters of the simple activity of mind, speech and body (of others).

440. And complex (Vipulamati) (is) of six kinds, as knowing the subject matter of the simple and complex (activity) of body, mind, and speech ( of others ). And (all six kinds) are stimulated by question, or (by look) at any part (of the questioner).
Commentary.
A saint comes to know when any body who has forgotten what he had thought of or done before, questions him about the matter or is simply present, and wishes to know the same.

441. Simple mental knowledge knows the material objects of (all) the three times (past, present and future), thought of by (any) soul in the present. Complex (mental knowledge) knows also what (has been thought of) in the past and (will be thought of) in the future.
Commentary.
Simple mental knowledge directly sees the thing upon which the mind of another is exercised in the present. For example, a man is thinking of establishing a library. Simple mental knowledge

will see this fact. Also if the man is thinking of establishing a library of the same pattern as the Bodleian, but has forgotten the details; simple knowledge will see the present desire and also the forgotten details. There is no historic record of a particular action done by Lord Mahávíra, when preparing for renunciation. Complex knowledge can even to-day see his mental activity corresponding to that preparation. Simple knowledge cannot see this fact because there is nothing in the mind of another, at the present moment to link up that past with the present.

442. As the visual (knowledge) rises (by the destruction-subsidence of the matter of visual-knowledge-obscuring Karma)in the whole body, or in the marks (conch, etc.) on the body, in the very same manner, mental knowledge rises (from the destruction subsidence of mental-knowledge-obscuring-Karma) in the material mind (organ).

.. 444. It (mind) is named "No-Indriya," quasi-sense, because of the absence of (its external) manifestation, like other sense organs. (It) is there, (in the mind), that mental activity and mental-knowledge arise.

445. And mental knowledge appears in saints with one or more of the seven super-natural powers (Riddhis, namely Buddhi, Tapa, Vikriya, Aushadha, Rasa, Bala, Akshina) and with ever increasing lofty conduct, in the seven (spiritual stages, from the 6th to 12th).
इंदियणोइंदियजोगादि पेक्वित्तु उजुमदी होदि । हिरवेक्खिय विउलमदी ओहि वा होदि णियमेण ॥ ४४६॥ इन्द्रियनोइन्द्रिययोगादिमपेक्ष्य ऋजुमतिर्भवति । निरपेक्ष्य विपुलमतिः अवधिर्वा भवति नियमेन ॥४४६॥
446. Simple mental (knowledge) arises at the initiation of the (5) senses, the quasi-sense (i. e., mind , or vibratory activity (of the soul through mind, body and speech of one self or of another). Complex mental (knowledge) and visual knowledge necessarily arise without any initiation,
पडिवादी पुण पढमा अप्पडिवादी हु होदि बिदिया हु। सुद्धो पढमा बोहो सुद्धतरो बिदियबोहो दु॥४४७॥ प्रतिपाती पुनः प्रथम अप्रतिपाती हि भवति द्वितीयो हि । शुद्धः प्रथमो बोधः शुद्धतरो द्वितीयबोधस्तु ॥ ४४७ ॥
447. And the first (i. e., simple mental knowledge is) separable (Pratipati), but the second (complex mental knowledge is) inseparable (Apratipati). The first know. ledge (is) clear, but the second knowledge (is) clearer.

Commentary. A saint with complex mental knowledge must attain liberation from the same body. That very knowledge is enlarged to omniscience.
परमणसिठियमह ईहामदिणा उजुट्टियं लहिय । पच्छा पचक्खेण य उजुमदिणा जाणदे णियमा ॥ ४४८॥ परमनसि स्थितमर्थमीहामतिना ऋजुस्थितं लब्ध्वा । पश्चात् प्रत्यक्षेण च ऋजुमतिना जानीते नियमात् ।। ४४८॥
448. (The saint) having directed his attention to the material object located simply in the mind of another, through conception (the íhá kind of) sensitive knowledge verily knows (that object) directly by means of simple mental (knowledge). चिंतियमचिंतियं वा अद्धं चिंतियमणेयभेयगयं ।
ओहि वा विउलमदी लहिऊण विजाणए पच्छा ॥ ४४६॥ चिन्तितमचिन्तितं वा अर्द्ध चिन्तितमनेकभेदगतम् । अवधिर्वा विपुलमतिः लब्ध्वा विजानाति पश्चात् ।। ४४६ ।।
449. Complex mental (knowledge) like visual (knowledge) being (directly) inclined (to it), knows whatever has been thought (in the past) or has not been thought (i. e., will be thought in the future) or is half thought (about matter) of many kinds.

451. (The measure of) minimum and maximum subject matter of simple mental (knowledge) is (respectively) the unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha) shed from the physical body and the matter shed from the organ of sight tin one instant). मणदव्ववग्गणाणमणंतिमभागेण उजुगउक्कस्सं। खंडिदमेत्तं होदि हु विउलमदिस्तावरं दव्वं ॥ ४५२ ॥ मनोद्रव्यवर्गणानामनन्तिमभागेन ऋजुगोत्कृष्टम् । खण्डितमात्रं भवहि विपुलमतेरवरं द्रव्यम् ॥ ४५२ ॥
452. The minimum subject matter of complex mental knowledge is the part obtained by dividing the maximum subject matter of simple mental knowledge by the common ratio Dhruvahára which is) an infinite part of the number of divisions in mind molecules.

456. The phrase, human region indicates the (square of the, diameter and not the circumference, because the spatial extent of the mental knowledge is said to be cubic dimensions with a square base, ( but smaller height).
Commentary.

Yojans.
If a square is formed round the circle of the Mánoshuttara mountain, it will include four little corner-spaces beyond the human region, and mental knowledge knows also the matter in the mind of the celestial and sub-human beings in those corners.

Commentary. Thus there are 7 kinds of control (samyama). (1)Equanimity-(Sámáyika). (2)Recovery of equanimity-after-downfall(Chhedopasthápaná). (3)Pure-and absolute-non-injury (Parihára vishuddhi). (4)All but entire-freedom from passion, or slightest delusion
(Súkshma Sámparáya). (5) Ideal and passionless (Yathá-khyáta). (6)Partial control (Desha-samyama). (7)Non-control (Asamyama). संगहिय सयलसंजममेयजममणुत्तरं दुरवगम्म । जीवो समुव्वहंतो सामाइयसंजमो होदि ॥ ४७०॥ संगृह्य सकलसंयममेकयममनुत्तरं दुरवगम्यम् । जीवः समुद्वहन् सामायिकसंयमो भवति ॥ ४७०॥

471. Having pierced through the old condition (of censurable conduct into which it fell from its condition of equanimity, Sámáyika) the soul, who fixes himself in the observance of the (5 sorts of) control, is with recoveredequanimity (Chhedopasthápaná). पंचसमिदो तिगुत्तो परिहरइ सदावि जो हु सावजं । पंचेकजमो पुरिसो परिहारयसंजदो सो हु ॥ ४७२ ॥ पंचसमितः त्रिगुप्तः परिहरति सदापि यो हिसावद्यम् । पश्चैकयमः पुरुषः परिहारकसंयतः स हि ॥ ४७२ ।।

CHAPTER XIV.
Conation soul-quest (Darshana márganá)
जं सामरणं गहणं भात्राणं व कट्टुमायारं । विसे सिदू

245
482. The vague and indefinite apprehension of things without grasping anything definite and without knowing the details of a thing is said to be conation (Darshana) in scripture. (See Dravya Sangraha G. 43, S. B. J. Vol. I). भावाणं सामाविसेसयाणं सरूवमेत्तं जं । वराहीग्गहणं जीवेण य दंसणं होदि ॥ ४८३ ॥ भावानां सामान्यविशेषकानां स्वरूपमात्रं यत् । वर्णनहीनग्रहणं जीवेन च दर्शनं भवति ॥ ४८३ ॥
483. The indescribable apprehension by the soul of the mere presence of objects having general and particulars (qualities) is conation (Darshana).

484. That by which the (object) of sight is made visible or (that) which sees ( such objects ) —they call it ocular conation (Chakshu Darshana). The becoming visi• ble (of their peculiar object) to the other (4) senses (and

quasi-sense, the mind)-this should be known to be the non-ocular conation (Achakshu Darshana).

485. And from an atom, etc., up to the last (maximum) molecule (mahá skandha, are the forms of) material substances—that which sees them directly is the visual conation (Avadhi Darshana).
बहुविहबहुप्पयारा उज्जोवा परिमियम्मि खेत्तम्मि । लोगालोगवितिमिरो जो केवलदसणुज्जोओ॥ ४८६॥ बहुविधबहुप्रकारा उद्योताः परिमिते क्षेत्रे । लोकालोकवितिमिरो यः केवलदर्शनोद्योतः॥४८६ ॥
486. Luminaries of many kinds, in many ways, (make visible) limited space. That luminary which removing all darkness makes visible the (whole) universe and the non-universe (is) perfect conation (Kevala Darshana).
जोगे चउरक्खाणं पंचक्खाणं च खीणचरिमाणं। चक्खूणमोहिकेवलपरिमाणं ताण णाणं व ॥४८७॥ योगे चतुरक्षाणां पञ्चाक्षाणां च क्षीणचरमाणाम् । चक्षुषामवधिकेवलपरिमाणं तेषां ज्ञानं व ॥४८७॥
487. The total of 4-sensed beings, and of 5-sensed beings up to the end of (the 12th stage, where all delution) has been destroyed (is the number of souls) with ocular (conation). And the number (of souls) with visual and perfect (conation) (is equal to the number of) those (who have visual and perfect) knowledge.

488. The total of (souls in) the infinite groups from one-sensed beings up to the end of (the 12th stage, where all) passions have been destroyed is the number of souls with non-ocular conation..
CHAPTER XV. Thought-paint soul-quest (Leshyá Márgana.) लिंपइ अप्पीकीरइ एदीए णियअपुण्णपुण्णं च । जीवोत्ति होदि लेस्सा लेस्सागुणजाणयक्खादा ॥ ४८६ ॥ लिम्पत्यात्मीकरोति एतया निजापुण्यपुण्यं च । जीव इति भवति लेश्या लेश्यागुणज्ञायकाख्याता ॥४८६ ॥
489. That by which the soul, stains himself with, or, makes his own the demerit (Pápa) and merit (Punya) is the (thought) paint (Bháva Leshyá). So it has been described by the knowers of the attributes of Paint (Leshyá).
Commentary, Thought-paint seems to be a better expression than thought colour. Colour is a part of the thing itself. Paint is something imposed from without. The soul is immaterial (Amúrti), and colour (Varna) is an essential and peculiar attribute of Matter (स्पर्थ रस गेष वर्णवन्तः पुद्गलाः)
Thought-colour and thought forms are familiar to all students of Theosophy. See " Thought Forms by Mrs. Besant and C. W. Leadbeater 1905." There are differences in arrangement, and in description also here and there. The definite, and unbridgeable demarcation between living and non-living, which characterises Jainism so beautifully is sometimes lost sight of. The soul, i.e., consciousness and also every modification of this consciousness, i.e. thought-activity, is immaterial and colourless. Colour is in matter; and matter certainly acts and reacts upon the soul by Inflow, Bondage, etc., due to Passions and Vibrations.

490. The vibratory activity (of the soul) coloured by the operation of the passion (sub-class of deluding karma) is thought-paint ( Leshya). Therefore 4 ( kinds of) bondage has been said to be the effect of these two.
Commentary.
Vibratory activity (Yoga) determines the nature of Karmic matter (Prakriti) and the number of Karmic molecules (Pradesha) which bind the soul. The passions (kasháya) by their intensity, etc. determine the duration of bondage (Sthiti), and strong or mild character of fruition (Anubhága.)

498. Black (Krishna), blue (Nila), dove-grey (Ka. pota), yellow (Teja or Pita), pink (Padma) and white Shukla ---verily these are the six kinds of Paints (Leshyá).
Commentary. From the view-point of substance thought-paints are of six kinds; but from the view-point of modifications their number is innumerable times innumerable spatial units of the universe.

(And of) each (of these) (there are) numerable, innumerable and infinite distinctions (from the point of view respectively of their being visible to the eye, of the number of their molecules and the number of their atoms). णिरया किण्हा कप्पा भावाणुगया हु तिसुरणरतिरिये। उत्तरदेहे छकं भोगे रविचंदहरिदंगा॥ ४६६ ॥

496. Hellish beings (are) black. Heavenly beings (have the colour of their bodies) according to their thought. . paints. (And) in the remaining three (kinds of) celestials, in humans and sub-humans (and in their) transformed bodies (there are all the) six (colours). In the (supreme, Uttama, middle, Madhyama and lowest, Jaghanya), enjoyment (regions,) the bodies are) respectively (in colour like) the sun, (and) the moon, (and are) green.

499. The operation-places (Udaya Sthána) of passions are innumerable universe (i. e., innumerable times the innumerable spatial units of universe). Of these, the pain. ful (and) bad (passion places are by far in excess of the) pleasant, good, by calculation.
Commentary. Bad passion-places correspond to the three bad thought-paints, black, blue and grey, and good passion-places to yellow, pink, and white. The total number of places being divided by a smaller kind of innumerable universe spatial units, give the number of
d places, and these are themselves innumerable universe units. The huge balance is the number of bad and painful places.

500. The bad (thought-paint places are) most intense (Tibra-tama), more intense (Tibra-tara), intense (Tibra); and the good (thought-paint places are) mild, (manda) more mild, (manda tara) and most mild, (manda-tama). And in each, (the decrease and increase) is 6-fold (as given in the chapter of knowledge in gatha 325 and the following).
Commentary. The operation places of passions (Kasháy-adhya-vasáya-sthana) are equal to innumerable times the innumerable spatial units of universe.
Let this be equal to 1; and let the divisor for it=innumerable universe-9.
Then good thought-paints are 1:9- " bad , , , the rest-1-1

502. By the increase of pain, the soul modifies (its conditions) through grey, blue, and black (thought paints). Thus by the decrease and increase of pain (there) is (modification) of 3 bad (thought paints.).
Commentary.
All sub-humans up to 4-sensed and hellish beings, have only these three bad thought-paints.

505. In thought-paints, (the change) in their own. place (Svasthána) from the maximum (is) by minimum decrease (i. e., decrease by infinite part, Ananta Bhāga Háni) and (the change) from the minimum (is) by minimum increase, (i. e., increase by infinite part, Ananta Bhága Vriddhi). (And) necessarily, (the change) from the minimum (of every thought paint) to other place (Parasthána) is by decrease infinite fold, Ananta Guna Háni).
Commentary. Out of six Leshyás, three are bad and three are good. Black, blue and grey are bad. The thought activity in black is the worst. Pale, pink, and white are good. The best thought activity is in white. In each thought-paint, the change in degrees, from the highest impurity or purity to the lowest impurity or purity, respectively, will be by infinite part. But when it is to be transformed into its next thought-paint of low impurity or purity the change will be by infinite fold decrease. The highest impurity in black-thought-paint having decreased to its last decrease of infinite part, is at its lowest point of impurity. But the minimum impurity in the next, namely the blue thought-paint, will be by infinite fold decrease in the lowest impurity of black-thought-paint. And so on.

507-508. Six men, travellers, are lost in the central part of a forest. Seeing a fruit-laden tree they (severally) think of eating the fruits, by uprooting (the tree), by cut. ting its trunk, by (cutting) the branches, by cutting the minor branches, by plucking (the fruits), by (picking) the fallen (fruits from the ground). Their speech (which represents the six kinds of activity) in the mind is the (result or) action (of the respective thought-paints).
___ Commentary. The person who wants to uproot the whole tree is actuated by black-thought-paint. The one who keeps the root, but wishes to cut it down from the trunk is of blue-paint. He who wishes to cut the large branches is of grey-thought-paint. The remaining three persons do not want to destroy the generating parts of the tree, but they are indifferent in having their object fulfilled as harmlessly as possible. The person who wants to pick up the fallen fruits

518. There are 26 parts of thought-paints. Of these the eight middle ones (only are) fit for bondage of age (Karma), (and) these occur at the eight declining-times (Apakarsha Kala).
.. Commentary. Among six thought paints there are 26 parts. The most intense part of black is one. The most mild part of white is another.
The remaining 24 parts occur in both bad and good thought paints by 6 places of increase or decrease (infinite part, etc.)

between the most intense black and the most mild white, namely from black to blue 6 places decrease.
blue to grey 6 » white to pink 6 ,, pink to yellow 6
These 24+2 said above are the 26 parts of thought-paints. Out of these, 8 parts are for age-bondage only. In the chapter on passions we have given a diagram to Gatha 295. It shows that the force of passions is classified into four kinds (1) Intenser like stone (2) intense like earth, (3) mild like dust, (4) milder like water.
In the first stone-kind, there are 2 divisions, in the last or most intense of black no age Karma is bound, but in the next division. which is a kind of medium intense black, hellish age only is bound. In the second earth-kind, there are medium conditions of all the six thought-paints; bondage of all the four kinds of age Karma is possible there. In the third dust-kind, also there are 6 thoughtpaints of medium mild kind, where also all the four age Karmas • are bound: but in places where black thought paint is absent, there is such a mild degree of five other thought-paints, that only celestial age-Karma is bound. Its last portions do not bind any age Karma. The fourth, water kind is the mildest and cannot bind any age-Karma.
Thus it will be seen that out of 24 medium places of thoughtpaints there are only 8 such special medium kinds of thought-paints. which only have the capacity of binding age-Karmas.
Rule for bondage of age Karma in humans and sub-humans of work-region (Karma bhúmi) for future incarnation is, that when two-third of their operative age-Karma is exhausted, the first occasion, where a soul may bind age-Karma appears for one antar-mu: húrta. Then again after the expiry of two-third of the remaining age-Karma, the second occasion for bondage of age-Karma appears for an antar-muhúrta. Thus after expiry of every two-third part of the remaining age, six more occasions for bondage of age-karma will in succession be presented to the soul. If a soul cannot have the required kind of medium thought-paint in any of these 8 occasions which are called Apakarsha-Kála or declining-times, he must bind it in the last antar-muhúrta of his life.
It should be noted that a soul will bind only one of the four age Karmas. He cannot bind more than one. He will gain rebirth in the same condition of existence corresponding to the particular ageKarma bound for future life. It should also be noted that duration

of age-Karma can be increased or decreased in other declining-times, if age-Karma has already been bound in any previous declining time.
In order to illustrate the eight periods of declining-times let us suppose that a human being has got his operative age Karma for a duration of 6561 years. Then the 8 occasions will appear as shown below: Declining times.

Celestials and hellish beings bind it, when only six months are left in their life. All these also have the eight declining-times in the period of 9 or 6 months, respectively.
Humans and sub-humans of work-region where 8 decliningtimes for bondage of age-Karma occur during full length of their age are called Sopakramáyushka or with breakable age. They can die early by untimely shedding off of age-Karma molecules on account of suicide, murder, incurable disease, fire, railway accident etc. If no such disturbance occur, they would die after completing their age-Karma fully. Celestials, hellish, humans and subhumans of enjoyment-region as well as some great men out of 63 Shaláká Purushas (24 Tírthankars, 12 Chakravarties, 9 Náráyanas, 9 Balbhadras, and 9 Prati-náráyanas), who attain liberation from that life are called Anupakramáyushka or with unbreakable age. They die a natural death.

(The wrong-believing humans and sub-humans of the work-region), dying with the middle parts of the three black, (blue and grey are born) as fire, air, and incomplete sensed (i. e. 2,3, and 4-sensed Vikalatraya, beings (or as irrational 5-sensed and the common (Sádhárana) vegetables). (And) the hellish and the (remaining) celestial beings go to the human and sub-human (conditions of existence) corresponding to the particular thought-paints (with which they die).
Commentary, A soul is born always in that condition of existence for which he has bound to himself the age Karma in the eight decliningtimes in which the age-Karma can be bound in life, but the death point is also important, as it seriously affects the future condition of the soul. If no age Karma is bound in the 8 declining-times, then the duration of age-Karma and the condition of existence, both, are determined within the Antar-muhúrta which precedes death by an innumerable part of a wink or Ávalí called Asankshepaddha. But if the age Karma has been bound in one of the previous eight declining-times (Apakarsha-Kála), the condition of existence (Gati) will remain the same, but the soul will go to a higher or lower part of it, according to the character and degree of the thought-paint at the time of death.

530. In human and sub-human (beings there are) all (the 6 thought-paints); in one, and 2 to 4-sensed beings, the three (black, blue and grey). In the irrational (5sensed developable sub-humans), four (black, blue, grey and yellow), In the (irrational) and rational (five-sensed) completely undevelopable wrong. believing (sub-human and human being3); in (the potentially developable human, sub-human, residential, peripatetic and stellar beings), in down-fall from right (to wrong belief), there are three bad (thought-paints, black, blue and grey).
Commentary. Beings with one to 4 senses are never reborn as hellish or celestial beings. The irrational 5-sensed developables can be born as residential or peripatetic celestial beings, when dying with yellow-thought-paint, and as hellish, when dying with grey. Humans and sub-humans with subsidential-right-belief do never possess three bad-thought-paints, but when such a right-believer falls from right-belief to the second downfall stage on account of the operation of any of the error-feeding passions, he can have 3 bad-thought-paints in his undevelopable condition.

भोगाऽपूर्णकसम्यक्त्वे कापोतस्य जघन्यकं भवेनियमात् । सम्यक्त्वे वा मिथ्यात्वे वा पर्याप्ते तिस्रः शुभलेश्याः ॥३१॥
531. In the right-believing, potentially developable (human and sub-human beings) of enjoyment (regions), necessarily there is the minimum part of grey. In the developable (humans and sub-humans in the enjoyment regions) in their (condition of) right or wrong belief (there are) three good-thought-paints (yellow, pink and white).
Commentary. The right believing potentially developable soul in enjoyment regions has the minimum grey-thought paint, because dying as a right believer he was bound to be born as a male heavenly being, but before he acquired right belief he may have bound an age-Karma for a lower condition of existence. If this condition was human or sub-human then instead of going to heaven he will have to go to the highest enjoyment-region, where we have the best human and sub-human life. The thought-activity at death time of such a soul will be a little painful, and therefore he has minimum greythought-paint also, although in the enjoyment-regions, there are only the three good thought-paints.

532. In the non-control (condition of the soul, i.e., up to the 4th stage of vowless-right-belief, Avirata Samyaktva there are) six thought-paints. In the three, (i.e, 5th, 6th and 7th, stages of) partial vow, (imperfect vow and perfect vow) there are three good thought-paints. From that (the 8th to the 13th stages there is), white thought paint (only). And (there is) no thought-paint in the (14th) stage of nonvibration.
Commentary. Thought-paints are the colours of vibrations coloured with passions. When the vibrations stop, there is no thought-paint.

(minimum) white; (medium) white; and maximum white. And the non-developable three residential (peripatetic and stellar have only) the bad-thought-paints (black, blue and grey).
Commentary. It should be noted that the heavenly celestials have the same thought-paint in their non-developable and developable conditions.
Sub-Chapter IX Cause (Sádhana). वण्णोदयसंपादिदसरीरवएणो दुदव्वदो लेस्सा। मोहुदयखओवसमोवसमखयजजीवफंदणंभावो॥ ५३६ ॥ वर्णोदयसंपादितशरीरवर्णस्तु द्रव्यतो लेश्या । मोहोदयक्षयोपशमोपशमक्षयजजीवस्पन्दो भावः ॥ ५३६ ॥
536. The colour of the body produced by the operation of the colour (sub-class of the body making Karma) is matter-paint (Dravya Leshyá). The vibration of the soul produced by the operation (in the first four stages), by destructive-subsidence in the 5th, 6th and 7th stages), by subsidence in the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th, stages of subsidential ladder (Upashama Shrení), and by destruction (in 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th) of deluding-Karma (Moha) is thought.(paint) (Bháva Leshyá).
Commentary Here vibratory activity would seem to be the same as thoughtpaint. Yoga and Leshya, i.e., Vibration and thought-paint are really not two things but two aspects of the same thing, with the distinction that in one the vibratory activity alone is considered and in the other it is considered as mixed with and coloured by the passions. The vibratory activity is the same. It is never without the tint or taint of passion of some kind or other which is found only in the first 10 stages. The passion-coloured vibration is the thought-paint in these 10 stages. In the next three there is no passion, but there is
ation, which results in white thought-paint, the purest and highest kind of thought-paint. Here although there is no passion, thought-paint is said to exist, because its basis, the vibration still continues, although there is no passion to taint it with any colour.

Notice also that the passionless vibratory-activity is still the cause of inflow of Karmic and Quasi-Karmic matter into the soul. The quasi-Karmic matter, i.e., Áháraka, speech, mind, and electric molecules are assimilited, but the Karmic molecules merely touch the soul for an instant and pass away without binding. Note also that where there is no passion there is inflow only of the molecules of pleasant feeling-Karma (sátá vedaniya). Where there is passion, there is an inflow every instant of all the Karmas except the age Karma.

537. The total of (souls) with black, etc., (i. e. black, blue, and grey thought-paints), (should be) divided by an innumerable part of an Ávali ; (the quotient) subtracted from the total and the balance equally divided among the three (thought-paints). (The quotient should) again be divided (by an innumerable part of an Ávalí), (and the resulting quotient subtracted from the first quotient, and added to one of the three equal parts, to get the number of souls in black thought-paint). (The process indicated in Gatha 179 should be adopted to find out the number of souls with other thought-paints). (Soul) substances (may be) described on the basis of time, also, by division, etc. in order, (according to the above process).
Commentary, Let the number of souls with all the three bad thought-paints be 3525, and let an innumerable part of an Ávalí be 5. Then 3525-5 - 705. And 3525-705-2820. And 2820 should be equally distributed among the three thought-paints. And 2820 : 3 940, which should be assigned to each of the three thought-paints. 705 should again be divided by 5. And the quotient 141, being subtracted from 705, and the balance added to 940, we get 705-141-940 - 1504.

as the number of souls with black thought-paints. And 940 +1411415 - 1081-282 10528 would be number of souls with blue thought-paints. And 940+141÷5-940+28-2-968 2 would be the number of souls with grey thought-paints. And 1504 +1052 8+968*2 - 3525.
This shows that, proportionately speaking, souls with blackthought-paint are the greatest in number.

Commentary. Stellars with yellow thought-paint amount in number to the basic area of the universe divided by 65536 square fingers.
The words " and more" include the following :
Residentials with yellow thought-paint amounting in number to base line of the universe multiplied by the square root of a cubic finger.

543. The place of (the souls) with (three) bad (thoughtpaints as) to their own place (svasthána), overflow (Samúdgháta, and) birth-time (is) the whole universe. And (the place of the souls) with three good (thought-paints is) innumerable part of the universe.
Commentary.
Here place or Kshetra signifies the space where at a particular time the souls with respective thought-paints are found.
Fine one-sensed beings, with three bad-paints, are pervading through out the whole universe.
Svasthana is of two kinds, (1) Svasthána Svasthana, the place of their birth (2) Viháravat Svasthana, the place to which they can go out.
Samudgháta or overflow means the extending of spatial units of mundane souls out of body to some extent and then resuming their former form. Souls do not leave their own body, but extend out. There are seven occasions when such overflow is possible: -
(1) Vedaná samudgháta, pain-overflow, emanation on account of extreme and unbearable suffering.
(2) Kasháya samudgháta, passion-overflow, emanation on account of passionate thought activity.

273
(3) Vaikriyika samudgháta, fluid overflow-emanation on account of transformation into small or large fluid body or into many such bodies. Celestials do not leave their own place, they send their newly made fluid body with extending soul-units to far off places. Their connection is never ceased.
(4) Máranántika samudgháta, death-bed overflow-emanation before death for touching the place of next birth. The soul extends to that point and then contracts and dies thereafter.
(5) Taijasa samudgháta, electric overflow-It is possible in
ts with special powers obtained by ascetic practices. It is bad or good. If a saint gets in rage, his soul-units emanate from his left shoulder with electrical matter, and burn the undesirable object. This is bad. A saint being compassionate at seeing famine or disease prevaling anywhere, emanates his soul-units with electric matter from right shoulder. It removes all cause of trouble and brings happiness.
(6) Áháraka Samudgháta, assimilative overflow--A saint in 6th scriptural stage emanates a man-like white form of one cubit from his head with soul-units. It goes to an omniscient or saint with full scriptural knowledge and sees him. The saint either removes his doubt or enjoys the benefit of personally paying respect to him.
(7) Kevali Samudgháta, omniscient overflow-when age Karma has a smaller duration than that of other three Karmas, body-making, family-determining and feeling, then the soul of an omniscient Conqueror overflows and expands throughout the whole universe in 4 instants, and then withdraws to its body in another 4 instants, and the duration of all four Karmas becomes equal.
Upapáda means extent of space in the first instant of birth after leaving the last body.
Place should be considered with reference to the above ten conditions, the two Svasthana, seven Samudgháta and Upapáda. Souls with bad thought-paints are not found in electric, assimilative, and omniscient overflow. For details see sanskrit commentary.
मरदि असंखेज्जदिमं तस्सासंखा य विग्गहे होति । तस्तासंखं दूरे उववादे तस्स खु असंखं ॥ ५४४॥ . म्रियते असंख्येयं तस्यासंख्याश्च विग्रहे भवन्ति । तस्यासंख्यं दूरे उपपादे तस्य खलु असंख्यम् ॥ ५४४ ॥

in transmigration. An innumerable part (is) in distant (overflow), and an innumerable part of it (is) in birthplace (Upapáda).
Commentary. This gatha mainly refers to the celestials of Saudharma and Ishána heavens. They are with pale thought-paint.
The total number of them is equal to spatial units in the universe line (Jagat shrení) multiplied by a third square root of a cubic finger. Their total being divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those dying in one instant: This quotient should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya. The resulting quotient being subtracted from the preceding quotient the balance called "many parts" is the number of those in transmigration with one, two or three turns. This number should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient being subtracted from the number, the remaining “many parts" balance is the number of those in death-bed overflow. This number being divided by an innumerable part of a palya, the quotient is
he number of those with distant death-bed overflow. This number should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those in the birth-instant.
The number found above multiplied by the place of one soul gives the total place for that.
For the number of pink and white thought-paints and other details see Sanskrit commentary.
सुक्कस्स समुग्घादे असंखभागा य सव्वलोगो य । शुक्लायाः समुद्राते असंख्यभागाश्च सर्वलोकश्च ।

overflow Samudgháta) and first instant of birth (upapáda) is the whole universe,
___Commentary. Place (Kshetra) is the space in which the soul is at present. Extent (Sparsha) is the space in which the soul has been in the past and is in the present.
Generally the extent of soul with three bad paints is the whole universe for their own place (Svasthāna), overflow (Samudghata) and first instant of birth.
In details, the black-paint souls out of the ten places called Padas, for their sphere of birth (Svasthāna Swasthana), anguish (Vedná), passion, (Kasháya), death-bed overflow (márnánika samudgháta) and instant of birth in transmigration (Upapáda) have the whole Universe as their extent.
___ Their extent (Sparsha) of sphere of motion (Vihāravat-svasthána) is basic area (Jagatpratar) multiplied by numerable linear finger (Súchi-angula). In their transformation overflow (vaikriyika Samudgháta) it is a numerable part of the universe.
In the black-thought-paint there is no electric (Taijasa) Áhárka and omniscient (Kevala) overflow.
The extent of blue and grey should be known like that of black. See sanskrit commentary for further details. तेउस्स य सहाणे लोगस्त असंखभागमेत्तं तु ।

546. (The extent) of yellow as regards its sphere of birth (Svasthāna svasthāna), and (its sphere of motion Viháravat-svasthána) are necessarily an innumerable part of the universe, and a little less than 8 parts out of 14 (of the mobile channel, Trasa Nadi respectively). .

And (the extent is) the same (i. e., a little less than of mobile channel in overflow (for souls of yellowthought-paint, but for death-bed overflow it is) a little less than - (of mobile channel). And for first instant of birth in transmigration (Upapáda) the extent (Prathamapada is) a little less than one and half (parts) of 14 (of mobile channel).

548. The extent (prathamapada) of pink (thought paint) for sphere of motion (Viharavat svasthāna), and for two pairs of overflow, (i, e., anguish and passion, transformation and death-bed overflow) are necessarily a little less than 8 by 14 parts (of mobile channel) and (for sphere of birth, Svasthána svasthána it is innumerable part of a universe; and for electric Taijasa and Aharaka overflow is numerable cubic fingers).

549. And the extent (of pink-paint) for the instant of birth in transmigration (Upapáda) is little less than five out of fourteen parts (of mobile channel). Of the white (paint) (the extent) for the first, (i.e., sphere of birth Svasthána svasthána is an innumerable part of the universe). And for the 3 places, (i. e., sphere of motion, overflow in anguish, passion, transformation, and deathbed and instant of birth in transmigration, it is) a little less than a (of the mobile char nel).

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. For the celestial and hellish beings the extra time is equal to 2 Antar-muhúrta, because their thought-paint begins one Antarmuhúrta before they are born and continues for one Antara-muhúrta after their death. The extra time for yellow and pink is little less than half Ságara. It is thus. Saudharma and íshána heavenly beings have the maximum age of 2 Ságaras, but if a right believer with interrupted age (Ghátá-yushka) dies prematurely and is born there, he may have an age of 23 Sagaras minus one Antar-muhurta. Similarly a wrong believer dying prematurely can add an extra innumerable part of a Palya to his age. These 2 extras are possible up to the 12th heaven, because no one dying prematurely can be born beyond it. A little less than half Ságara will be added to the prescribed age of each pair of heavens till the 12th heaven.

It is the same for the three yellow (pink and white), but the maximum intervals are necessarily the innumerable matter cycles of existences (Pudgala Parivartana),
Commentary, Interval means time spent in other thought-paints before regaining the one which was left. A soul born in Videha with one crore of Púrya age, acquires black thought-paint at the age of 8 vears minus 6 Antar-muhúrtas, then he changes into blue, grey, pale, pink and white gradually, each in one Antar-muhúrta. Then

he becomes a saint with white thought-paint, retains it for the remaining life, and after death goes to Sarvárth-siddhi for 33 Ságars. There he keeps his white thought-paint. Then he is born a man and for one Antara-muhúrta he remains in white paint. Then he begins to transform from white to pink, pale, grey and blue and black each in one Antara-muhúrta. The interval for black is thus 33 Ságars, 1 crore Púrva years minus 8 years and 10 Antar-muhúrtas. This example will show interval of blue and grey also with, respectively, 2 and 4 Antara-muhúrtas less than black.
The intervals for the other three thought-paints is no doubt a long time, for only five sensed beings can have them. If a soul has to pass from one-sensed to 4-sensed lives, he can pass a long time there with only 3 bad thought-paints. After a long time, he may become again five-sensed with pale thought-paint. Sub-Chapter XV & XVI.-Modifications and quantity

555. As to quality the six-thought-paints are due to the operation (of Karmas). Their quantity has been described as the number of (their) matter (in sub-chapter of number, Sankhyá). Thus the paints are described.
Commentary. The least number is of those with white thought-paint, yet It is innumerable. Its innumerable-fold is the number of those with pink thought-paint. Its numerable fold is the number of those with pale thought-paint. Its infinite fold is the number of souls with grey thought paint. A little more than this is the number of those with blue thought-paint and a little more than this is the number of souls with black thought-paint.

556. Freed from thought-paints, black and others, having crossed (the ocean of mundane ) existences, possessed of infinite bliss, and having acquired the abode of liberation-such liberated souls or the non-vibratory omniscients, should be known to be Paintless (Aleshyá).
CHAPTER XVI.
Capacity of liberation, (Bhavya márganá).
भविया सिद्धी जो जीवाणं ते हवंति भवसिद्धा । विवयाऽभव्वा संसारादो ण सिज्यंति ॥ ५५७ ॥ भव्या सिद्धिर्येषां जीवानां ते भवन्ति भवसिद्धाः । तद्विपरीता अभव्याः संसारान्न सिद्ध्यन्ति ॥ ५५७ ॥
557. The souls whose liberation is to take place (or who have the capacity of liberation) are capable of liberation (Bhavya siddha or Bhavyas). The opposite to these (are) incapable of liberation (Abhavya). They are never liberated from mundane existence.
Commentary,
Souls as seen by omniscient are of two kinds, Bhavya, capable of liberation, and Abhavya, incapable of liberation. Even in Bhavyas, who have got the capacity, only those who will have favourable circumstances for making efforts for liberation can attain liberation, while those who will never have favourable circumstances will never be liberated.
भव्वत्तस्स जोग्गा जे जीवा ते हवंति भवसिद्धा ।
हु मलविगमेशियमा ताणं कणवलाणमिव ॥ ५५८ ॥ भव्यत्वस्य योग्या ये जीवास्ते भवन्ति भवसिद्धाः । न हि मलविगमे नियमात् तेषां कनकोपलानामिव ॥ ५५८ ॥
558. ( Some) would-be-liberated souls, who are cap - able of being liberated (Bhavyatva), are such that their dirt (of Karmic matter) like (the dirt of) golden ores (Kanakopala) will certainly never be removed.
णय जे भव्वाभव्वा मुत्तिसुहातीदांत संसारा । ते जीवा गायव्वा व य भव्वा अभव्वा य ॥ ५५६ ॥

न च ये भव्या अभव्या मुक्तिसुखा अतीतानन्तसंसाराः। ते जीवा ज्ञातव्या नैव च भव्या अभव्याश्च ॥ ५५६ ॥
559. Those souls who are neither capable of liberation (Bhavya), nor incapable of liberation (Abhavya), but have the bliss of liberation (and are) beyond the cycle of infinite existence should be known to be neither Bhavya nor Abhavya.
Commentary. The distinction of Bhavya and Abhavya apply only to the mundane souls.
अवरो जुत्ताणतो अभव्वरासिस्स होदि परिमाणं । तेण विहीणो सव्वो संसारी भव्वरासिस्स ॥ ५६०॥ अवरो युक्तानन्त अभव्यराशेर्भवति परिमाणम् । तेन विहीनः सर्वः संसारी भव्यराशेः ॥ ५६० ॥
560. The total number of souls incapable of liberation (Abhavya) is the minimum secondary infinite (Jaghanya Yuktánanta). All the mundane souls minus these (is) the total (of) souls capable of liberation (Bhavya).
Commentary. Mundane souls wander in 5 kinds of Parivartana, cycle of wandering:
(1) Dravya-Parivartana, matter cycle. It is of two kinds, quasikarmic and karmic. No-karma, quasi-karmic cycle is the time which soul takes in the renewing exactly the same set of a particular number and quality of molecules, as it took once. Karmic cycle is the time taken in-renewing exactly the same set of a particu number and quality of 8 karmas, as the soul took in once. The time taken in both of these is called one matter cycle or dravya or pudgala parivartana. For example a soul takes on a body to day, with its quasi-karmic and karmic matter. It goes on changing both. When in the course of its changes, it again chances to take on a similar body with similar quasi-karmic and karmic matter, it is said to have completed one matter cycle (Dravya Parivartana).
(2) Kshetra Parivartana. Space-Cycle. The time taken by

one soul in going once, round every single point of space in the universe consecutively, beginning from the foot of Mount Meru.
(3) Kala Parivartana. Time-cycle,-a soul is born in the first samaya, or instant of an Avasarpiní, then in the 2nd samaya of another (next or any other) Avasarpiní, then in the 3rd samaya of a third, and so on; till in the last samaya it is born in the last samaya of a new Avasarpini. Similarly it must be born in Utsarpini. Then it must die in each samaya of the two eras, like the above. The time taken to go through all this is a Time-Cycle(KálaParivartama.)
(4) Bhava-parivartana, Incarnation-cycle, a soul is born in hell with minimum age of 10,000 years. He is reborn again (after other births) in hell with 10,000 years ago. This goes on as many times as there are samayas in 10,000 years. Then he is reborn there with an age of 10,000 years, and one samaya, then with an age of 10,000 years and 2 samayas, and thus at every birth, he adds one samaya till he is born with the maximum age of 33 Ságaras. The time taken is called Hellish-Cycle. Similarly with the Celestial-Cycle; but there the minimum is 10,000 years and the maximum is only 31 Ságaras, up to the 9th Graiveyaka.
In the sub-human and human-Cycles the minimum is one Antar-muhúrta, and the maximum is 3 palyas. The procedure is the same as in the Hellish and Celestial-Cycles.
The time taken in all these four cycles, is called one Incarnation-Cycle.
(5) Bháva-Parivartana. Thought-Cycle.
Innumerable units of soul's, Yoga-sthána, Vibratory activity make one Anubhága-bandha-Adhyavasáya-sthána, or a degree of the passion which determines intensity of bondage. Innumerable xinnumerable, Anubhága-bandhas make one Kasháyá-dhya-vasáya sthána. 2. e., one degree of passion which determines the duration of bondage. Innumerable x innumerable Kasháya, etc., make one Jaghanya-sthiti-bandha, i. e., minimum duration of bondage in a rational wrong-believing person. This is Antah crore X crore ságars. One sthiti needs that the soul should pass through everyone of the innumerable Yoga-sthánas, to earn one Anubhága-bandha and then so on, to earn one sthiti. Thus it should go up to the maximum duration of each one of the 8 Karmas, of course adding only one samaya at each step onwards from the minimum duration. When it has thus gone through the 8 karmas and their 148 divisions, it is said to have done one Thought-Cycle (Bháva-parivartana).

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary.
Mundane souls are said to be material from the figurative point of view, because every spatial unit of a mundane soul is full of infinite Karmic material molecules.
अजीवेय रुवी पुग्गलदव्वाणि धम्म इदरोवि ।
आगासं कालोविय चत्तारि रूविणो होंति ॥ ५६४ ॥ जीवेषु च रूपीणि पुद्गलद्रव्याणि धर्म इतरोपि ।
श्राकाशं कालोपि च चत्वारि रूपीणि भवन्ति ।। ५६४ ॥
584. In the non-living, matter substances (Padgala Dravya_are) material (Rūpi ). And the four, medium of motion (Dharma), and the other Medium of rest ( Adharma), Space (Akáshá) and time (Kála) are immaterial (Arúpí).
Commentary.
Padgula is so-called because it unites and forms into molecules and dissolves into particles, also it modifies in its attributes colour, smell, taste and touch. An atom is in a regular hexagonal. As substance it is one, as to modification, it is possible to say, that it has a six-fold modification from its six faces.
Sub-Chapter II. - Description of Differentia. उ जोगो वरणचऊ लक्खणमिह जीवपोग्गलाणं तु । गदिठागोग्गहवत्तणकिरियुवयारो दु धम्मचऊ ॥ ५६५ ॥ उपयोगो वर्णचतुष्कं लक्षणमिह जीवपुद्गलानां तु । गतिस्थानावगाहवर्तनक्रियोपकारस्तु धर्मचतुर्णाम् ॥ ५६५ ॥
565. The differentia (Lakshana) of soul, matter and the four (other substances ), medium of motion (medium of rest, space and time respectively, are) attention (Upayoga); the four attributes, colour, (smell, taste and touch); auxiliary help in the activity of motion (of soul and matter), of rest (of soul and matter), giving place (to all substances); and of alteration (in substances ).

गतिस्थानावगाहक्रिया जीवानां पुद्गलानामेव भवेत् । धर्मत्रये न हि क्रिया मुख्याः पुनः साधका भवन्ति ।। ५६६ ।।
566. The activity of motion, rest and occupation of space is only in soul and matter (substances). In the three, medium of motion, ( and of rest and space, there is ) no (such) activity. But they are the important causes (of the three activities respectively).
जत्तस्स पहं ठत्तस्स असणं विसगस्स वसदी वा । गदिठाणोग्गहकरणे धम्मतियं साधगं होदि ॥ ५६७ ॥ यातस्य पन्थाः तिष्ठत श्रासनं निवसकस्य वसति । गतिस्थानावगाहकरणे धर्मत्रयं साधकं भवति ॥ ५६७ ॥
567. ( Like ) the road for the traveller, seat for the sitter, and the house for the resident, the three, medium of motion (and of rest, and space) are the auxiliary causes in effecting motion, rest and giving of space (respectively).

वर्तनाहेतुः कालो वर्तनागुणमवेहि द्रव्यनिचयेषु । कालाधारेणैव च वर्तन्ते हि सर्वद्रव्याणि ॥ ५६८ ॥
285
568. Time is the cause of alteration (Vartaná). The attribute of altering is in all the (six) substances. And all subtances alter only by the support (Adhára) of time (substance).

569. Because in the media of motion and rest, etc., (i. e., in the six substances ), ( there is an attribute of) in - dividuality (Agurulaghu, by means of which a substance never loses its own essential and peculiar attributes and

never acquires the peculiar and essential attributes of any other substance), (and this attribute of individuality) alters (Vartate) itself by increasing by 6 increases or by decreasing by (6) decreases in its infinitesimal degrees (Avibhága Pratichheda).
Commentary.
In all substances whether pure or impure, natural modifications of 6 fold increase and 6 fold decrease in infinitesimal degrees of the common attribute of individuality do occur at every instant. It is due to this sort of change that we can attribute rise (Utpáda), decay (Vyaya), and continuity (Dhrauvya) in pure souls (Siddhas), and to pure Space, time, media (substances) of motion and rest. These changes are called natural modifications (Svabháva Paryaya). For six-fold increase and decrease see Gatha 322 and those which follow.
य परिणमदि सयं सो ण य परिणामेइ अएण मरणेहिं । विविहपरिणामियाणं हवदि हु कालो सयं हेदू ॥ ५७० ॥ न च परिणमति स्वयं स न च परिणामयति अन्यदन्यैः । विविधपरिणामिकानां भवति हि कालः स्वयं हेतुः ॥ ५७० ॥
570. Time never alters itself into the other ( 5 substances), nor does it change the other (substances into itself). . It is merely the auxiliary help to the other (substances) characterised by different kinds of alterations.
कालं अस्सिय दव्वं सगसगपज्जाय परिषदं होदि । पायावद्वाणं सुद्धरणये होदि खणमेत्तं ॥ ५७१ ॥ कालमाश्रित्य द्रव्यं स्वकस्वकपर्यायपरिणतं भवति । पर्यायावस्थानं शुद्ध नयेन भवति क्षणमात्रम् ॥ ५७१ ॥
571. By the support of time, ( each) substance is altered in its own modifications. The duration of (each of these) modifications is an instant only from the pure real stand point (i. e., from the actual conditional stand-point, Riju sútra Paryáyárthika naya).

572, Vyavahara, Vikalpa, Bheda and Paryáya (are) synonymous, (signifying modification). The duration of modification (Vyavahára) (is) practical time (Vyavahára Kala).

578. The minimum duration of modification (Paryaya) is only an instant. That (alone is) Samaya (instant). It amounts to the time taken by one atom in passing over to the other (where two atoms are placed side by side in space).

more (i, e., minus 2 or more instants till the result is one Ávalí and one Samaya) is one Bhinna or (Antar)-muhúrta.
Commentary. The minimum antar-muhúrta is one Ávalí and one Samaya. Then follow innumerable medium Antar-muhúrtas. The maximum is one muhurta minus one Samaya.

576. (30 Muhúrtas make) one day (and night). (15 days and nights make) one fortnight, (2 fortnights make) one month. (2 months make) one season (Ritu), (3 seasons or Ritu make) one half year (Ayana). (2 ayana make) one year, and there are other (measures of time), the numer. able, innumerable and infinite divisions of practical time (Vyavahára Kála).

577. But this practical time (Vyavahára Kála) should be known in the human region (2) continents up to the Mánushottara Mountain); because the practical (time) corresponds to the movements of the stellars (with their abodes Vimána).

the liberated souls multiplied by numerable winks (Avalís).
Commentary, In every period of 6 months and 8 instants, 608 souls leave the primitive common, or Nitya Nigoda, condition; and the same number of souls, enter the abode of liberation from the 2 continents.
The number of siddhas or liberated souls is infinite part of the total of all the souls (mundane and liberated). 6 months and 8 Samayas being reduced to Ávalís and divided by 608 would be the numerable Avali mentioned in the gatha.
It would be noticed that the numerable Avalis in the Gatha are constant. They do not vary. They represent the average time for one soul to attain liberation. The number of liberated souls increases every 6 months and 8 instants by 608. This explains the ever-increasing-length of past time by the constant number of of Ávalís.
समयो हु वट्टमाणो जीवादो सव्वपुग्गलादो वि । भावी अणंतगुणिदो इदि ववहारो हवे कालो ॥ ५७६ ॥ समयो हि वर्तमानो जीवात् सर्वपुद्गलादपि । भावी अनन्तगुणित इति व्यवहारो भवेत्कालः॥ ५७६ ॥

The future practi. cal time is infinite times (the total of all) souls and all matter (substances). कालोचि य ववएसो सब्भावपरूवो हवदि णिच्चो। उप्परणप्पद्धंसी अवरो दीहंतरहाई ॥ ५८०॥ काल इति च व्यपदेशः सद्भावप्ररूपको भवति नित्यः। उत्पन्नप्रध्वंसी अपरो दीर्घान्तरस्थायी ॥५८०॥
580. And the very name "Time" (Kála) itself is an index to the (Time) substance itself, (which as a substance is) permanent, (but) rises and decays (as regards its modifications). And the other (i. e., practical time rises and decays like present time, but is) of a very long duration (as past and future).

581. The time of existence of the six substances is. the same, (for all ). Its duration is got by adding together their modifications in attributes (Artha Paryaya) and their modifications in space (Vyanjana Paryáya) in all the three times (present, past and future).

582. Whatever modifications take place in a substance in its attributes (Artha Paryaya) or in space (Vyanjana Paryáya) in the past, the future and (the present), they constitute the substance.
Commentary.
A substance is nothing separate from, but is merely the name of the sum total of its attributes and modifications.

583. Except space, all the substances exist only in the universe (Loka), not beyond it (i. e., in the non-universe). (And the substances ), media of motion and rest (Dharma and Adharma ) are (all) pervading (vyapi ), fixed (Avasthita), un-quivering ( Achalita in their units, Pradeshas), and permanent.
Commentary.
Support is of 3 kinds, (1) tactile (Aupashleshika), wherein the supporter and the supported touch each other, as the book is on the

(Achala). In the other mundane souls they are quivering-nonquivering; i.e., all the units quiver from birth to death except the 8 central units which do not quiver. All the same, every unit of soul is bound by Karmic matter. But the bondage is due to the nature of vibration (Yoga capacity to draw in molecules) and not to their being quivering. Therefore these 8 units do not quiver but are bound by Karmic matter.

601. (From the second to the 23rd molecule) each is one more than the maximum of the one immediately preceding it. Thus matter substances with their 23 kinds have been described by the Conqueror (Jina).
Commentary. Among the 23 kinds of molecules, the first kind of atom-molecules have no minimum and maximum divisions, because each atom is its one separate molecule. The other 22 kinds of molecules have minimum, medium and maximum divisions. The minimum and maximum are shown below, between these two there are many medium divisions of successive increase of one atom.

616. In the smooth and the other (i.e. rough degrees both) even (sama) and odd (vishama) (series) two, three, etc., increase by two (each). And in each of the two (smooth and rough) even and odd (series), there are similar (Rúpí) and the other (dissimilar Arúpí).

617. Proceeding beyond (atoms of) 2, 3 and more (degrees), union would occur (in case of) difference of 2 degrees, between (them) whether, they be smooth or rough, or both (smooth and rough). Still an (atom of) minimum (degrees does not unite) anywhere.
Commentary. Atoms unite together with the difference of 2 degrees. A smooth atom of two degree will unite with a smooth or rough atom of 4 degrees only. Similarly an atom of 3 degrees of roughness will unite with that of 5 degrees of roughness or smoothness only. Atoms having one degree of smoothness or roughness will never unite.

618. An atom with minimum degree of smoothness or other(i.e, roughness) is never fit for union in its own place or in the other. It unites (if there is a proper) change in its degree (of smoothness or roughness) owing to external and internal causes.

Commentary.
An atom as long as it has got only one degree of smoothness or roughness will neither unite with another atom with one degree nor with other atoms of more degrees. But when degrees of smoothness or roughness are increased in that very atom owing to internal capacity of change and auxiliary cause of other substances, it becomes fit for bondage with other atoms possessing 2 degrees in
excess.

619. In molecules of numerable, innumerable, and in - finite atoms, (the atoms) with greater degrees of smoothness or other (i. e. roughness) when uniting, alter (atoms of) lesser (degree) to their own kind).
Commentary.
This gatha shows that there is the same rule for the union of molecules also. A molecule of 500 degrees will unite with another of 502 only, neither more nor less. Any atom or molecule uniting with another of less degrees than two will transform it into its own kind. When a rough atom with 25 degrees unites with a smooth atom of 23 degrees, the united molecule will be a rough molecule.

622. The two, soul (and non-soul) have been explained (before). The meritorious souls (Punya. Jiva are) with the attribute of right belief, and also with vows. And the demeritorious (Pápa Jíva) are the reverse of them. मिच्छाइट्ठी पावाणंताणंता य सासणगुणावि । पल्लासंखेज्जदिमा अणअण्णदरुदयामिच्छगुणा ॥ ६२३॥ मिथ्यादृष्टयः पापा अनन्तानन्ताश्च सासनगुणा अपि । पल्यासंख्येया अनान्यतरोदयमिथ्यात्वगुणाः ॥ ६२३ ॥
628. Wrong-believers(are)demeritorious,(and amount to) infinite x infinite, and also those (who are) in the downfall stage (Sásádana Guna Sthána) by the operation of any one of (the four) error-feeding (passions going down to) the stage of wrong-belief, and (they are in number) an innumerable part of a Palya. मिच्छा सावयसासणमिस्सा विरदा दुवारणंता य। पल्लासंखेज्जदिममसंखगुणं संखसंखगुणं ॥ ६२४ ॥ मिथ्याः श्रावकसासनमिश्रा विरता द्विवारानन्ताश्च । पल्यासंख्येयमसंख्यगुणं संख्यासंख्यगुणम् ॥ ६२४ ॥
624. Wrong-believers (are infinite into infinite. Lay. men (Shrávaka in the Partial-vow-stage), (souls) in down. fall (Sásádana), in mixed (Mishra), and in vowless (Avir. rata, i. e., the 4th stage number respectively) an innumer

able part of a Palya, an innumerable times (the innumerable part of a Palya), numerable times (of this last product), and innumerable times (this last number).
Commentary. Partial vow stage is found in human and sub-human beings. The innumerable part of a Palya souls in this stage as given above refer to sub-humans, and 13 crores of humans should be added to that number. Downfall stage is found in all the four conditions of existence. In this stage there are 52 crores of humans also, and the souls in the other three conditions of existence number innumerable times the souls with partial vow. The mixed stage of rightand-wrong-belief is also found in the four conditions of existence. In this stage the humans are 104 crores; and the number of souls in the other 3 conditions of existence is the numerable times the total of those in downfall stage.
The vowless right-belief is also found in the four conditions. In it the number of humans is 700 crores; and the number of the other 3 is the innumerable times the total of those with mixed right and wrong belief.
The division of Palya by innumerable representing the number of partial vowers means that the Palya is to be divided 3 times by the innumerable and then once by numerable. In the downfall stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable and then once by numerable. In the mixed stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable. And in the vowless stage, Palya is divided once by innumerable.

And for the downfall right-belief it is numerable times. (The divisor for the downfall stage, in 11 places from Anata, Pránat to 9 Graiveyakas is numerable times of that for its immediate predecessor. We begin with Anat, Pranat, where the divisor is numerable times that for the mixed souls in the last Graiveyaka). In the above (5) places the index of numerable is successively 5, 6, 7, 8 and 4.

642. (The number of humans) in the partial-vow stage should be known to be thirteen crores; in the downfall stage, 52 (crores); in the mixed, double of that (i, e., 104 crores), and in the vowless, (right-belief) 700 crores.

644. The matter of inflow (Asrava) and stoppage (Samvara) (is) one unit of bondage (Samaya-Prabaddha). And the maximum matter of shedding (Nirjará) is necessarily innumerable times of it (i. e., of a unit of bondage).
Commentary. The maximum shedding is of course the result of special deliberate austerities, as is shown in multiplicatory series of shedding (Guna Shreni Nirjarā) in gathas 66 and 67 above, and in the Tattvartha Sutra, chapter 9 Sutra 45.

845. (The matter of) bondage is one unit of bondage (Samaya-prabaddha) and (the matter of the final shedding at the end of the 14th stage just before attaining) liberation (Moksha) is a little less than (one unit of bondage multiplied by) one and a half Gunahani-Thus things ascertained as they are (Tattvártha) should be believed.

646. The belief which is caused by the destruction of right belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Moha and 4 errorfeeding-passions sub-classes of right-conduct-deludingKarma) is perfectly pure. It (is) destructive right-belief (Ksháyika Samyaktva so called as it destroys the causes of wrong belief entirely). (It is) eternal and (is) the cause of destruction of Karmas.
Commentary. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief can attain liberation in the same life. But if before or after its acquisition the soul binds celestial-age-Karma, he will be born as a celestial and if before its acquisition the soul has bound hellish-age-Karma, will be reborn in the first and not in a lower hell, will thereafter be reborn as a man, and then attain liberation. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief will thus surely attain liberation in the third life. But if before acquiring destructive right-belief he had bound a human, or sub-human age-Karma, he would be reborn in the enjoyment-region, from where he would be reborn as a celestial and then as a man in work-region and attain liberation in his 4th life. Note that destructive right-belief never leaves the soul once it has been acquired. So in hell also there are some souls with right-belief who are just waiting to attain liberation in their next birth. Raja Shrenika alias Bimbasára, father of Ajit-shatru a contemporary and a follower of Lord Mahávíra and a devout listener to the letterless speech (Anaksharí Váni) in his Samavasarana is such a soul in the first hell. Before attaining destructive rightbelief he had bound a hellish-age-Karma of the maximum kind of 33 Sagaras, on account of having put a dead snake, round the neck of Saint Yeshodhara in meditation. Then he repented and ultimately in the Samavasarana of Lord Mahavira acquired perfect rightbelief and then in the subsequent declining times (Apakarshana Kála) though he could not change the character of th age Karma he had already bound, he reduced the maximum duration of 33 Sagaras of the 7th hell to 84,000 years in the 1st hell, where the minimum is 10,000 years. Thus he has passed about 2,500 years in hell, from where he would be reborn in BharataKshetra after nearly 81,500 years as Padma Nábha, the 1st Tirthankara in the beginning of the third aeon of the next or Utsarpini 'cycle of time and attain liberation after having re-proclaimed Jainism in Bharata-kshetra. It is interesting to note that the

continuity of Jain tradition is curiously evident in the above account. Before the last Tirthankara of the present cycle attained liberation, his teaching was already implanted in a soul so firmly that when the proper time comes it should fructify as exactly the same teaching from the mouth of the first Tirthankara of the next cycle. Lord Mahávíra attained liberation 3 years and 8 months before the expiry of the 4th Aeon of the present cycle. The present or the 5th aeon is 21,000 years long, the next one the sixth and the last of the present cycle is also of 21,000 years' duration. The next cycle retraces the course of the present cycle, so that its first two Aeons will be 21,000 years each. And after nearly 84,000 years after Lord Mahávíra's liberation the soul of Raja Shrenika which has literally been under the earth for the whole of this long length of darkness will be reborn and blossom forth as Padma Nábha, the propounder afresh of Eternal Truth.

648. The initiator (Prasthápaka) of the destruction of right-belief-deluding-Karma (Darshana Moha, and of the 4 error-feeding-passion is) certainly a man born in the work-region (Karma bhúmi), (who begins it) at the feet of an omniscient (or of a saint with full scriptural knowledge), and (he would be its) accomplisher (Nishthápaka) in all (conditions of existence).

Commentary. Any human soul while he has begun the destruction of right belief-deluding Karma and is on the process of destruction may die and go to any of the four conditions of life. He will complete its destruction there. The beginning of the destruction can only take-place in human life, but the final destruction which must necessarily come-about, may happen in any other condition of existence. दसणमोहुदयादो उप्पज्जइ जं पयत्थसदहणं ।

649. Belief in the (9) categories, which is produced by the operation of (the clouded-right-belief sub-class of) the right-belief-deluding-Karma is destructive-subsidential right-belief (Vedaka or Kshayopa-shamika Samyaktva). Know it to be wavering (Chala), impure (Malína) and non-, steadfast (Agárha). (Compare Gathas 25 and 26).

650. The belief in the (9) categories produced by the subsidence of right-belief-deluding-Karma (and of the 4 error-feeding-passions) is subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva) (and is) like water with its dirty mud settled down, ' खयउवसमियविसोही देसणपाउग्गकरणलद्धी य ।

(Vishuddhi), (3) precept (Deshaná), (4) Completency (Prayogya), (5) efficiency (Karana), the first four are common (i 8. attainable by all), but the efficiency Karana) is attained only by (soul capable of) right-belief, (and liberation).
Commentary. Kshayopasama-Labdhi, destructive-subsidential attainment, is attainment by a soul (by the subsidence, destruction and operation of certain Karmas) of such senses, mind, etc., that he may be able to acquire right-belief.
Vishuddhi Labdhi-virtue attainment, is attainment of a disposi. tion for good, and against bad actions.
Deshaná Labdhi, precept attainment, is attainment of an inclination to know the Truth. This reduces the Sthiti, duration of Karmas except the Ayukarma, the age Karma, to a maximum of Antar Kodá Kodi, inter crore of crore, Ságaras and a minimum of one crore (Ságaras).
Práyogya-Labdhi, competency-attainment, is attainment of thought activity which further reduces the Sthiti, duration of the 7 • Karmas, i.e., all except the Ayukarma, age-Karma. But as to intensity of fruition the reduction applies only to demeritorious Karmas. The meritorious Karmas are proportionally increased in intensity of fruition (Anubhága).
Karana Labdhi -efficiency attainment, is attainment of thoughtactivity which must cause right-belief in one Antar-muhúrta, within 48 minutes.

852. (A soul) attains right-belief (if he is) capable of liberation, (Bhavya) in whichever of the 4 conditions of existence (Gati) he may be, (is) rational, developable (Páryápta), Virtuous, possessed of knowledge attentiveness (i.e. Sákára), awake, with favourable thought-paint, and with efficiency-attainment (Karana Labdhi).

653. Even after the binding of the age-Karma of the four places (i.e., conditions of existence, Gati), right belief is possible, but except in (bondage of) celestial age, (in the bondage of other ages, the soul) does not acquire the minor vows (Anuvrata) and great vows (Mahāvrata).

654. He who has fallen from right belief, but has not reached wrong belief is in downfall (right-belief Sásádana . Samyaktva). He should be known to be with the fifth kind of thought activity (i. e., natural Párinámika, with respect to the right-belief-deluding karma which is neither operative, nor subsided, nor destroyed in this stage).

655. The soul?in whom (there) is belief and nonbelief in the (7) principles, like the one with vows and non-vows (i.e.. in the 5th stage of partial vows) should be known to be right-wrong believer (Samyak-mithyadrishti in the mixed or 3rd stage). मिच्छाइट्ठी जीवो उवइटें पवयणं ण सदहदि । सदहदि असब्भावं उवइट वा अणुवइहं ॥ ६५६ ॥

658. Wrong believing soul does not believe in the Truth as preached (by the Conqueror) and believes in wrong views (of things) (whether they have been) preached (to him) or not preached.
Commentary. If preached, the wrong belief is called acquired, Grahíta otherwise, non-acquired, agrahita.. वासपुधत्ते खइया संखेजा जइ हवंति सोहम्मे । तो संखपल्लठिदिये केवदिया एवमणुपादे ॥ ६५७ ॥ वर्षपृथक्त्वे शायिकाः संख्येया यदि भवन्ति सौधर्मे । तर्हि संख्यपल्यस्थितिके कति एवमनुपाते ॥ ६५७ ॥ संखावलिहिदपल्ला खइया तत्तो य वेदमुवसमया।

857-58. If in the saudharma. (ishana) there are numerable destructive-right-believers in 3 to 9 (Prithaktva) years, then how many (will be in a duration of a numerable palya, we shall find this (as follows). A Palya divided by numerable Avalis, (is the total of) destructive-right believers. And this total multiplied by innumerabie Ávalís or divided by innumerable (is) respectively (the total of) destructive-subsidential (Vedaka) or subsidential right believers (Upashamaka).

The destruction-subsidence (Kshyayopashama) of the quasi-sense or mind-knowledge-obscuring-Karma (No-Indriya-varana-Karma), as also the knowledge produced by it is rationality (Sanjná). He who has got it is certainly rational (Sanjni). One who has knowledge of the other senses (only) is the other, i.e., irrational (or Asanjni). सिक्खाकिरियुवदेसालावग्गाही मणोवलंबेण। .

661. Rational (Sanjní), is the soul, who is capable of receiving instruction (Shikshá), of (understanding) gestures (Kriya), preaching (Upadesha) and recitation (Alapa), by help of mind. And (a soul) opposite to it (is) irra. tional (Asanjní).

Assimilative Soul-Quest (Áhára Márgana.) उदयावएणसरीरोदयेण तदेहवयणचित्ताणं । णोकम्मवग्गणाणं गहणं आहारयं णाम ॥ ६६४ ॥ उदयापन्नशरीरोदयेन तद्देहवचनचित्तानाम् । नोकर्मवर्गणानां ग्रहणमाहारकं नाम ॥ ६६४॥
884. The intaking of the quasi-Karmic molecules (No-karma Varganá) for a body, speech or mind under the operation of such body (sub.class of body-making- Karma) as happens to be in operation, (Udaya-panna) is called Assimilation (Áhára).
Commentary. The soul assimilates only 5 out of the 23 kinds of matter molecules enumerated in Gatha 594, 595.
These five are (1) assimilative (Ahara Vargana) which forms the physical, the fluid and the Áháraka bodies; (2) electric (Taijasa), (3) Speech (Bháshá,) (4) mind (Mano) and (5) Karmic (Kármana), of these the first 4 are called quasi-Karmic and the last is called Karmic.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
665. The soul constantly assimilates the molecules of one of the three (physical, fluid or Áháraka) bodies, and of speech and mind. Therefore (the soul) is called assi. milative (Aháraka).
विग्गहगदिमावण्णा केवलिणो समुग्घदो अजोगी य। सिद्धा य अणाहारा सेसा आहारया जीवा ॥ ६६६ ॥ विग्रहगतिमापन्नाः केवलिनः समुद्घाता अयोगिनश्च । सिद्धाश्च अनाहाराः शेषा आहारका जीवाः ॥ ६६६ ॥
888. Souls who are in transmigration (Vigraha Gati), the omniscients (in the 3rd, 4th and 5th instants in omniscient overflow, when they spread sheet-wise across the universe, fill it, and then contract sheet-wise again), and non-vibrating omniscients), and the liberated (souls aree) non-assimilative (Anáháraka). The rest (are) assimilative (Áháraka).
वेयणकसायवेगुध्वियो य मरणंतियो समुग्घादो। तेजाहारो छट्टो सत्तमो केवलीणं तु ॥६६७॥ वेदनाकषायवैगूर्विकाश्च मारणान्तिकः समुद्घातः । तेज आहारः षष्ठः सप्तमः केवलिनां तु ॥ ६६७ ॥
887. Anguish (Vedaná), passion (Kasháya), fluid (Vaikriyika), death-bed (Márnántika), electric (Taijasa), the 6th assimilative (Áhára ka),; and the 7th of the omniscient (kevalí, are the seven) overflows (Samudgháta).
मूलसरीरमछडिय उत्तरदेहस्त जीवपिंडस्स। णिग्गमणं देहादो होदि समुग्धादणामं तु ॥ ६६८॥ मूलशरीरमत्यक्त्वा उत्तरदेहस्य जीवपिण्डस्य । निर्गमनं देहाद्भवति समुद्घातनाम तु ॥ ६६८ ॥
668. Without having left the primary body, the going out of a group of soul (spatial units, Pradeshas) from the body along with the secondary bodies (i. e., Karmic and electric, which two are never separable from the mundane soul) is called overflow (Samudgháta).

669. And the (soul in the ) two Áháraka and death - bed overflows necessarily goes only in one direction. But (souls) in the other 5 overflows go in the ten directions. Commentary.
In the Áháraka and death-bed overflow, the height and width of the overflow is a numerable part of a linear finger (Súchiangula), but the length is very long.

670. The maximum time of an assimilative (Aháraka soul is the number of spatial units in) an innumerable part of a (linear) finger (Súchiangula); and the maximum (time) of the non-assimilative (soul) in the Karmic body ( is ) 3 instants.

Commentary,
Their minima are, respectively, 1 / 18th of a pulse beat minus 3 instants; and one instant.
कम्मइयकायजोगी होदि श्राहारयाण परिमाणं । तविरहिद संसारी सव्वो आहारपरिमाणं ॥ ६७१ ॥ कार्मणकाययोगी भवति अनाहारकाणां परिमाणम् । तद्विरहितसंसारी सर्व आहार परिमाणम् ॥ ६७१ ॥
671. The number of non-assimilative (souls) is (the same as that of) the souls with Karmic body Vibration, Mundane souls minus these (is) the number of all assimilative souls.

Commentary. Here the number of non-vibrating omniscient souls is not included. This calculation is limited to souls up to the.13th stage of vibrating omniscients, because in the 14th stage, there is no vibration, and hence no assimilation of any kind of matter is possible.

872. The (conscious) thought-activity produced in the soul for the purpose of (apprehending) a substance is certainly conscious attentiveness or attention (Upayoga), It should be known to be of two kinds with form (Sákára) and without form (nirakāra).
णाणं पंचविहंपि य अण्णाणतियं च सागरुवजोगो। चदुदंसणमणगारो सव्वे तल्लक्खणा जीवा ॥ ६७३ ॥ ज्ञानं पंचविधमपि च अज्ञानत्रिकं च साकारोपयोगः । चतुर्दशनमनाकारः सर्वे तल्लक्षणा जीवाः ॥ ६७३ ॥
673. Right knowledge of 5 kinds, and wrong know. ledge of 3 kinds is attention with form (Sákár upayoga). Conation of 4 (kinds) is (attention) without form. This con(scious attention is) a differentia (Lakshana) of all the souls.

679. In the 4 middle (vibrations) of mind and speech (i.e., the false and true of each of them, there are stages) from (wrong-belief) up to the delusionless, in rationals.
__ In the other (four vibrations, i. e., true and neitherfalse-nor-true of mind and speech, the stages are from the 1st up to the 13th), the vibratory omniscient; but neither (true-nor-false) speech (vibration begins) from the incomplete sensed (i. e., 2, 3 and 4 sensed).

682. In the fluid body vibration in developable, celestial and hellish beings (there are) the first four stages. In the other (i.e, non-developable) there is the mixed, i.e. fluidmixed-with-Karmic body vibration). This mixed vibration (exists) not in (the third stage of) mixed (right-and-wrongbelief).
Commentary.
In mixed-fluid-vibration only three spiritual stages are possible i.e. wrong belief, downfall and vowless right belief.
आहारो पज्जत्ते इदरे खलु होदि तस्स मिस्सो दु ।
तोमुहुत्तकाले छगु होदि आहारो ॥ ६८३ ॥ माहारः पर्याप्ते इतरे खलु भवति तस्य मिश्रस्तु । अन्तर्मुहूर्त काले षष्ठगुणे भवति आहारः ॥ ६८३ ॥
688. In the assimilative (body vibration) in the developable there is the 6th stage for the duration of one Antar-muhúrta. In the other (ie., non-developable) certainly is the mixed (ie, assimilative-mixed-with physicalbody vibration), (in which) 6th assimilation there is the stage for one Antar-Muhürta).

684. Like the physical-mixed (with Karmic body vibration), the Karmic (body-vibration) is in the same 4 stages. (But the difference is that) it is at the time of transmigration for the 4 conditions of existence, and in the vibratory omniscient stage (it is at the 3rd, 4th and 5th instant: of) the sheet-wise and whole universe (and again sheet-wise forms of omniscient overflow).

688, (In passion quest) the three, anger (pride, and deceit passions) (are found, respectively, in stages commencing from wrong belief) to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th part of (the 9th stage of) advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana (in all) from immobile embodiment. Greed (begins like the others but goes up) to (the 10th stage of) slightest attachment (Súkshma Sarága). Thus it should be known,

Commentary. Second-subsidential right belief arises only in the 7th stage, but the soul possessing it may fall down up to the 4th, therefore it is said to be from the 4th to the 11th stage.

699. In the wrong belief (stage, there are) (all the) 14 soul classes. In downfall, vowless, imperfect vow and (in vibratory omniscient stages there are) the two rational, (i.e., developable and non-developable). In the other stages up to delusioniess, (the 12th) (there is) only (one soul class of) developable rationals. तिरियगदीए चोदस हवंति सेसेसु जाण दो दो दु। मग्गणठाणस्सेवं णेयाण समासठाणाणि ॥७००॥ तिर्यग्गतौ चतुर्दश भवन्ति शेषेषु जानीहि द्वौ द्वौ तु । मार्गणास्थानस्यैवं ज्ञेयानि समासस्थानानि ॥७००॥
700. The soul-classes in the (1st) quest places should be known as follows:
In the sub-human condition of existence (there) are all the fourteen. In the remaining 3 (conditions of existence) know two (i.e., rational developable and undevelopable) in each.

Commentary. When vibratory omniscient is silent, only three vitalities are working, but when respiration is ceased, only 2 vitalities remain.

702. (All the 4 impulses, Sanjná, hunger, fear, coition, and attachment, are) active (from the first) to the 6th (stage of imperfect vow). (At the end) of the 6th stage) the first impluse (drops off), and the remaining (three exist) from the point of view of their causes only. The first (of these 3, i.e., fear) drops off at the end of (the 8th stage), new-thought activity, (Apúrva-karana). The remaining (coition and attachment drop off, respectively, at the end of the 9th, i e.) advanced-thought-activity (and the 10th, i.e.) slightest (passion, Súkshma Sámparáya).

704. In the three (stages of wrong belief, downfall and vowless, there are) 13 (kinds of vibrations, i.e., all except assimilative-body and its mixed (i.e, assimilative. physical-body-vibration). In the mixed (stage), 10 (i.e. all the above 13, except physical mixed, fluid-mixed, and Karmic-body-vibration; because no soul dies in the mixed and there is no consequent migratory or undevelop. able condition). And in (the next) seven (leaving the 6th, i.e., in the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th), nine(ie , the above 10, except the fluid-body-vibration), In the 6th, eleven(ive. the above 9 and assimilative body and assimilative-mixed with-physical body-vibration). In the vibratory omniscient (there are) 7 vibrations (the true, and neither-false-nor-true speech and mind vibrations, physical body, physical body-mixed-with-Karmic body, and the Karmic body vibrations). And (there) is no (vibration) in the stage of non-vibratory omniscient.

707. The further distinctions in the ( 14 ) stages and 14 quests dealt with in the above 20 chapters, ( are general, Sámánya; developable Paryápta and non-developable Aparyápta). From the point of view of sex-inclination and passion, (there are 5 distinctions) in the 5 parts (of the 9th stage) of advanced-thought-activity (anivritta Karana). घोघे मिच्छवि यदपमत्ते सजोगिठाणम्मि । तिणेव य झालावा सेसेसिक्को हवे खियमा ॥ ७०८ ॥

vibratory omniscient stages (there are all) the three distinctions (i.e. general, developable and non-developable); and in the remaining (stages), necessarily, (there) is only one (distinction i.e., developable Paryapta).
सामगणं पजत्तमपज्जत्तं चेदि तिरिण आलावा। दुवियप्पमपज्जत्तं लद्धी णिवत्तगं चेदि ॥७०६ ॥ सामान्यः पर्याप्तः अपर्याप्तश्रेति त्रय पालापाः। द्विविकल्प अपर्याप्तो लब्धिनिवृत्तकश्चेति ॥ ७०६ ॥
709. General, developable and non-developable these (are) the three distinctions. Non-developable is of two kinds, completely undevelopable (Labdhya Paryápta) and potentially developable (Nirvritta-Paryápta).
दुविहंपि अपजत्तं ओघे मिच्छेव होदि णियमेण । सासण अयद पमत्ते णिव्वत्तिअपुण्णगं होदि ॥ ७१०॥ द्विविधमपि अपर्याप्तमोघे मिथ्यात्वे एव भवति नियमेन । सासादनायतप्रमत्तेनिवृत्यपूर्णकं भवति ॥ ७१० ॥
710. In the worng belief stage necessarily, (there) is the non-developable (distinction) of both the kinds. In the downfall, vowless and imperfect vow stage (there) is only potientially developable (distinction).
जोगं पडि जोगिजिणे होदि हुणियमा अपुण्णगत्तं तु । अवसेसणवठाणे पज्जत्तालावगो एको ॥७११ ॥ योगं प्रति योगिजिने भवति हि नियमादपूर्णकत्वं तु । अवशेषनवस्थाने पर्याप्तालापक एकः ॥ ७११ ॥
711. And in the vibratory conquerors, necessarily, there is undevelopableness with regard to (the physicalmixed-with-Karmic body) vibration (in the omniscient overflow). In the remaining 9 stages there is only one distinction of developable.

712, In the wrong belief stage in the 7 hells, and in the vowless stage of the 1st hell, also, (there are all) the three distinctions (general, developable and nondevelopable). And in the rest (of the stages, i.e., downfall, mixed and vowless right belief in hell, there is only one) distinction of developable.

718. In the two, wrong belief, and downfall and in the vowless stages of 4 kinds of sub-humans (i.e. general, 5 sensed, developable and females) there are all the 3 distinctions. But in the vowless stage of the female subhumans, (there is) only (one distinction of developable). And in the remaining (i.e. mixed and partial vow stage), also (there is only one distinction of) developable.

714. In the completely un-developable sub-humans (there is only) one distinction, non-developable. In the 3 humans (i.e. general. developable and feminine, the distinctions are) according to the corresponding spiritural stages, but in the vowless stage among women (there is only) developable. मणुसिंणि पमत्तविरदे आहारदुगं तु णत्थि णियमेण । अवगदवेदे मणुसिणि सण्णा भूदगदिमासेज्ज ॥७१५॥ मानुष्यां प्रमत्तविरते आहारद्विकं तु नास्ति नियमेन । अपगतवेदायां मानुष्यां संज्ञा भूतगतिमासाद्य ॥ ७१५ ॥

715. In a soul (i.e. a saint) with feminine inclination in the imperfect vow stage necessarily there never are (the vibrations of) the two assimilative (Áháraka. and assimilative-mixed-with physical Áháraka Mishra). And in a soul with feminine inclination in sexless part of the 9th stage, (sex) inclination is mentioned from the point of view of the past (i.e, figurative or Naigama-naya point of view).
Commentary. The word "Tu" in the gatha refers to the following, (1) Mental knowledge and pure and absolute-non-injury control are not acquired by saints when they are under operation of feminine and common sex-inclination, (2) A woman can only have the first five spiritural stages. (3) second subsidential right-belief and mental
nowledge are not possible in saint with assimilative body or pureabsolute-non-injury-control.

720. In the wrong belief or any higher stage of the rationals, the distinctions are according to the corresponding stage. In the completely undevelopable, (there is only) one distinction of undevelopable.
भूाउतेउवाऊणिञ्चचदुग्गदिणिगोदगे तिरिण । ताणं थूलिदरेसु वि पत्तेगे तदुभेदेवि ॥ ७२१ ॥ भ्वतेजोवायुनित्यचतुर्गतिनिगोदके त्रयः । तेषां स्थूलेतरयोरपि प्रत्येके तद्विभेदेपि ॥ ७२१ ॥ तसजीवाणं ओघे मिच्छादिगुणेवि ओघ आलाओ। लद्धिअपुगणे एकोऽपज्जतो होदि आलाओ ॥ ७२२॥

721-22. In the gross and the other (fine) earth, water, fire, air bodied, ever-common (Nitya Nigoda) and the four-condition-common (Chatur-gati Nigoda, vegetables), and also in the two kinds (host and non-host Sapratishthita and Apratishthita), of individual (Pratyeka vegetables, there are all) the three distinctions. And in the wrong belief and other stages of the mobile souls, the distinctions correspond to their different stages. In the completely undevelopable (embodiments, there) is only one distinction of undevelopable.
एकारसजोगाणं पुण्णगदाणं सपुषणलाओ। मिस्सचउक्कस्स पुणो सगएकअपुरणालाओ ॥ ७२३॥ एकादशयोगानां पूर्णगतानां स्वपूर्णालापः । मिश्रचतुष्कस्य पुनः स्वकैकापूर्णालापः॥ ७२३ ॥

724, From the sex to the assimilation (quest), the distinctions are according to their respective stages. But in souls with common and feminine sex inclination (there) are not two assimilative body (and assimilative-mixedwith-physical body vibrations).

727. In the stages and quests, in what are (described as the 14 soul-classes) up to rationals, there can be 19 or (19) multiplied by one, two and three (i. e., 19, 38 and 57), sub-classes respectively. (See chapter on soul-classes).
वीरमुहकमलाणग्गयसयलसुयग्गहणपयडणसमत्थं । णमिऊण गोयममहं सिद्धतालावमणुवोच्छं ॥ ७२८ ॥ दीरमुखकमलनिर्गतसकलश्रुतग्रहणप्रकटनसमर्थम् । नत्वा गौतममहं सिद्धान्तालापमनुवक्ष्ये ॥ ७२८ ।। ___728. Having bowed to Gautama who was capable of understanding and proclaiming all the scriptures as issued from the lotus-mouth of (the last Tirthankara) Vira, I shall describe the distinction of the Jain Canon (Siddhanta).
मणपज्जवपरिहारो पढमुवसम्मत्त दोषिण आहारा। एदेसु एकपगदे णस्थित्ति असेलयं जाणे ॥ ७२६ ॥ मनापर्ययपरिहारः प्रथमोपसम्यक्त्वं द्वावाहारौ । एतेषु एकप्रकृते नास्तीति अशेषकं जानीहि ॥ ७२६ ॥
729. In (case of) existence of any of the following four, (1) mental knowledge, (2) absolute-non-injury-control (Parihára-vishuddhi Samyama), (3) First subsidential right-belief, and (4) the two, assimilative body and assimilative-mixed with physical-body-vibration, know that all the others cannot be found. बिदियुवसमसम्मत्तं सेढीदोदिएणअविरदादीसु ।
सगसगलेस्सामरिदे देवअपज्जगेव हवे ॥ ७३०॥ द्वितीयोपशमसम्यक्त्वं श्रेणीत अवतीर्णाविरतादिषु । स्वकस्वकलेश्यामृते देवापर्याप्तके एव भवेत् ॥ ७३० ॥
780. Second subsidential-right-belief is found in nondevelopable celestial beings only (when they are born). after dying with their respective thought-paints, after having fallen down to yowless and other (stages, from the (subsidential), ladder.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. The second subsidential right belief is found in no other undevelopables except those celestials. सिद्धाणं सिद्धगई केवलणाणं च दंसणं खयियं । सम्मत्तमणाहारं उवजोगाणकमपउत्ती॥७३१॥ सिद्धानां सिद्धगतिः केवलज्ञानं च दर्शनं क्षायिकम् । सम्यक्त्वमनाहारमुपयोगानामक्रमप्रवृत्तिः ॥ ७३१॥
731. In the liberated souls, the condition of existence (is) liberation, (knowledge is) perfect knowledge, (conation is perfect) conation, (right-belief is) destructive or purified right-belief, assimilation (of any Karmic molecule) does not exist, and the activity of attentions is (perpetual and) simultaneous. .
गुणजीवठाणरहिया सण्णापज्जत्तिपाणपरिहीणा। सेसणवमग्गणूणा सिद्धा सुद्धा सदा होति ॥ ७३२ ॥ गुणजीवस्थानरहिताः संज्ञापर्याप्तिप्राणपरिहीनाः । शेषनवमागणोनाः सिद्धाः शुद्धाः सदा भवन्ति ॥ ७३२ ॥
782. Free from (the distictions of) spiritural stages: and soul-classes, devoid of impulses, developableness, and vitalities, beyond the scope of the remaining 9 quests (i. eur all except the five mentioned in gatha 731), --The liberated souls remain always pure (and perfect souls). णिक्खेवे एयत्थे णयप्पमाणे णिरुत्तिअणियोगे।
मग्गइ वीसं भेयं सो जाणइ अप्पसब्भावं ॥ ७३३ ॥ निक्षेपे एकार्थे नयप्रमाणे निरुक्तयनुयोगयोः । मागयति विश भेदान् स जानाति आत्मसद्भावम् ।। ७३३ ॥
.783. He who investigates these twenty dintinctions by means of (4) aspects (Nikshepa), by their (various) synonyms (Ekártha), from different points of view (Naya), by means or measures of right knowledge (Parmána) by etymology (Nirukti), and by questions (Anuyoga), acquires knowledge of the true nature of soul.
