PUBLISHER'S NOTE
Ardhamāgadhi Jaina Āgamic literature is a valuable treasure of Indian culture and literature. It is unfortunate that due to the non-availability of suitable translations of these works, both, the laymen as well as the learned scholars were unfamiliar with them. Of these āgamic works, the Prakīrņakas have almost been unavailable even though they are of an ancient origin and are predominantly spiritual in their content. We are fortunate that Mahāvīra Jaina Vidyālaya, Mumbai has already published the original texts of these Prakīrņakas, duly edited by Muni Śrī Punyavijayajī, but in the absence of suitable translations in modern Indian languages, they were generally inaccessible to the lay readers. It is for this reason that the Coordinating Committee of the scholars of Jainology had decided to accord priority to the translations of the canonical texts and allotted the task of translating the Prakīrnakas to the Agama Samsthāna, Udaipur. The Samisthāna has, to date, translated fifteen Prakīrnakas into Hindi and published them for the benefit of the inquisitive readers.
However, those western and Indian readers, settled abroad, who don't read and understand Hindi, are still deprived of the contents of these enlightening works. We are happy to see that Colonel Dalpat Singh Baya has translated the 'Devindatthao Prakīrnaka’into English for such readers as well as for them that would enjoy reading them in English as much, if not more, as in Hindi. The exhaustive preface and original text with foot-notes have been taken from the Hindi edition of the work prepared by Dr. Subhash Kothari with the assistance of Dr. Suresh Sisodiya

MONETARY SUPPORT FOR THIS PUBLICATION
The monetary support for the publication of this work has been very generously provided by Shri Kamal Singh ji Bacchawat in the sacred memory of his mother, Late Shrimati Jatan Devi Bacchawat, who was herself generously endowed with noble qualities like sweetness of speech, dignity in behaviour, and a fountain of deep compassion in her heart. By virtue of such noble qualities of her personality she has left an indelible impression on the hearts of the members of her own family as well as those of others who came in contact with her.
Late Shrimati Jatan Devi Bacchawat was born, in the year 1940 AD, to her equally noble parents – Late Shri Champalal ji Kankariya and Shrimati Manak Devi Kankariya - of Gogolav in 1954. She was married to Late Shri Shikhar Chand ji Bacchawat from Bikaner and, in due course, gave birth to a son, Shri Kamal Singh ji Bacchawat and five daughters - Shrimati Kusum Sethiya, Shrimati Vijaya Bhansali, Shrimati Rekha Baphna, Shrimati Anju Choradiya, and Shrimati Sarita Daga. All of them have been married into highly cultured and religious families.

Shrimati Jatan Devi passed away on 27th September, 1998 in Gogolav and her son, Shri Kamal Singh ji Bacchawat, has very generously got the Samata Bhawan, and a guest house constructed at Gogolav. He has also got a complete wing of the Jain Hospital, Kolkata constructed in order to perpetuate the memory of his late parents.
Shri Kamal Singhji Bacchawat is a very religious person and he regularly and generously donates to promote educational, health and social service activities. He was the apple of his mother's eyes and she was able to instil noble qualities in her dear son who was very much devoted to her. He remains ever ready to extend health services to the poor. He and his family enjoy a very special place within the Kolkata sangha. His wife, Shrimati Sarala Bacchawat, daughter of Shri Bhanwarlal ji Bacchawat, is also of very noble, religious, and charitable nature and she always stands behind her husband in all charitable activities. They have a daughter, Shweta, who is a genius.
We appreciate Shri Kamal Singh ji Bacchawat's generosity in supporting the publication of this work and thank him for his gesture.

DEVENDRASTAVA
TRANSLATOR'S NOTE
Jaina canonical works are a treasure trove of spiritual and cultural heritage of India. However, the knowledge of these works is hidden behind the veil of Prakrit language, which is no longer an in language that it used to be when these works were codified. Yeomen services have been rendered, from time to time, by various scholars, both monks and householders, to render some of these works into Hindi and other modern Indian languages and, in rare cases, into English. As a result, the English-speaking readership is more or less deprived of this treasure.
The case of Prakīrņakas is still worse as their Hindi translations themselves were taken up, in an organised manner, only a few years ago. To my knowledge, no effort has so far been made to translate them into English except for seven Prakīrnakas translated by me and published by the Samsthan in the years 2001 to 2004. I can, therefore, feel a justifiable sense of elation and fulfilment on this near maiden effort in the field of translating the Prakīrņakas into English.
Translations are, at the best of times, only shadows of the originals. The problem becomes more acute when the original happens to be in an as ancient language as Prakrit and the language of the translation a western language as English. As exact equivalent words are not only difficult to come by, but, in some cases, well nigh impossible to find, one has to be content with a word, phrase or term nearest to the original meaning. It has been my endeavour to adhere as close to the original meaning as possible.
My task of translating this work, Devendrastava Prakīrnaka,

into English was very much simplified by its Hindi version, by Dr. Subhash Kothari and Prof, Sagarmal Jain, having been made available to me and, which I have freely used in my work. I am deeply indebted to these eminent scholars.
I shall be failing in my duty if I didn't mention the encouragement I have received from Prof Sagarmal Jain and Sri Sardarmalji Kankariya as well as the unstinted support of Dr. Suresh Sisodiya in my work. Agam Ahimsa Samata Evam Prakrit Samsthan, Udaipur deserves a special mention, as without their decision to bring out this work in its English edition, it would have been impossible to venture this effort. They have taken a great step forward and certainly deserve kudos.
I dedicate this effort to the memory of my dear departed father, Sri Ganeshlalji Baya, whose personal example, guidance and encouragement awakened in me a desire to study the Jaina philosophy and made me capable of undertaking this task. I must also not forget to mention the motivation received from venerable Acharya Shri Ramlalji Maharaj who has always encouraged me to proceed further and further in my scriptural quest. My wife, Mrs. Kanta Baya, who has patiently supported my effort day after day and month after month, also deserves my grateful acknowledgement.
How far have I succeeded in my efforts is for the readers and critics to judge. However, I shall feel rewarded if this work fulfils the purpose for which it is intended, even partly, as it would mark a beginning in the right direction.

PREFACE
General Introduction -
In every faith scriptures occupy an important position amongst religious texts. Agamas enjoy the same position and importance in the Jaina faith as the Vedas in Hinduism, Tripitaka in Buddhism, Avestā in Zarthustism, the Bible in Christianity and the holy Koran in Islam. Although the Agamas are neither considered to be as created by a superhuman entity or Apauruseya as the Vedas are considered to be, nor are they considered to be the divine message handed down by any prophet as the Bible and the Koran are considered to be, however, they are the compilations of the teachings of the most venerable and enlightened Arhantas and sage saints, who had realised the truth and attained enlightenment through spiritiual practices and purification. Although the scriptures say that that the Ariga Sūtras or the Primary canons or the foremost scriptures are considered to have been preached by the Tīrtharkaras or the Prophet Propounders of the Jaina faith, we must remember that they preach only the meaning (Artha) i.e. they only present the thoughts or the ideas, which are then given the garb of words or codified into sūtras or canonical texts by the Ganadharas' – the principal disciples of Tīrtharkaras, Ācāryas (Spiritual masters) and other learned preceptors, elders or senior monks (Sthaviras).

X VI: DEVENDRASTAVA
The Jaina tradition doesn't lay as much emphasis on words as the Hindu tradition does. It considers words only as a means to convey the thought or idea or meaning. In its view the meaning is important not the words. It is this lack of emphasis on words that the āgamas of the Jaina tradition could not keep their linguistic character unaltered as the Vedas have been able to do over the millennia. This is the reason that the Jaina canonical literature got divided into two streams, namely the Ardhamāgadhī canons and the Sauraseni canons. Of these, the Ardhamāgadhĩ canonical literature is not only more ancient but also closer to the original language in which Lord Mahāvīra preached. The development of the Saurasenīcanonical literature was also based on these Ardhamā gadhī canons. The Ardhamāgadhī canonical literature was also compiled and edited over a period of nearly a thousand years - from the time of Lord Mahāvīra to 980 or 993 Vīrābda (reckoned from the date of Lord Mahāvīra's Nirvāṇa), when they were rendered in their present form in the Vallabhi conclave assembled for the purpose. Therefore, it is quite possible that these were also modified, altered and enlarged by various preceptors during this period.
In the ancient times the Ardhamāgadhīcanonical literature was divided into two categories, namely the Angapravisttha (Canon included) and the Angabāhya (Canon excluded). The Angapravistha category includes eleven Anga Āgamas (Anga included or Primary canons, which are based on the sermons of the Tīrthařkaras and are composed by their principal disciples) and the Drstivāda while the Angabāhya Agamas (Arga excluded or other than Primary canons) include all the other canonical scriptures that were considered to be the compositions of the Śrutakevalis or Canon-omniscients who were fully learned in all canonical knowledge and the Pūrvadhara sthaviras (Elder monks in the know of the fourteen Pūrvas or the Pre-canons -- fourteen Pūrvas were a part of the twelfth Anga Āgama – Drstivāda). In

the Nandīsūtra, these Angabāhya canons have been further subdivided into Avaśyaka (Essential) and Āvaśyakavyatirikta (Other than essential). The Āvaśyakavyatirikta canonical works have again been divided into Kālika (Timely studiable scriptures) and Utkālika (Anytime studiable scriptures). This classification, as per the Nandīsūtra is as follows! :
Śruta or Āgamas

PREFACE :XIX found under the classification of Kālika Āgamas or the timely studiable canonical texts and the rest seven - Devendrastava, Tandulavaicārika, Candravedhyaka, Gani-vidyā, Maranavibhakti, Āturapratyākhyana and Mahāpratyā-khyāna -are found under the Utkālika Āgamas or anytime studiable canonical texts.' Thus, we see that the Devendrastava has been mentioned in the Nandīsūtra and the Pāksikasūtra among the extra-primary other than essential anytime studiable canonical work (Angabāhya Āvasyakavyatirikta Utkālika Āgamas). Besides this style of classification in the Nandīsūtra and the Pāksikasūtra, there is yet another ancient style of classification is found in Mülācāra, a sauraseni canonical work of the Yāpanīya tradition of the Digambara Jainas. Mūlācā ra divides the canonical texts into four classes” – 1. Tīrtharkara Kathita (Prophet preached), 2. Pratyekabuddha Kathita (Selfenlightened preached), 3. Śruta-kevalī Kathita(Canon-omniscient preached) and 4. Pārvadhara Kathita (Pūrva-learned preached). Again, in Mūlācāra, these āgamic works have been divided as Kā lika śruta and Utkālika śruta as well. In this classification of canonical works in the Mūlācāra, the 'Thudi (Stuti) has been mentioned as an Utkālika or anytime studiable canonical work. However, it is not clear as to whether the name ‘Thudi means Vīrastava or Devendrastava. Like this, in both the Ardhamāgadhi and the Sauraseni canonical traditions, ‘Thudi (Devendrastava or Vīrastava) have been mentioened as an Utkālika canonical text.
At present the canonical literature is classified into Anga (Primary), Upānga (Secondary), Mūla (Basic), Cheda (disciplinary), Āvaśyaka (Essential), and Prakīrņaka (Miscellaneous), canonical works. This classification was, first

of all, found in the Vidhimārgaprapā by Jinaprabha (Circa 13th century).' Generally, the term “Prakīrņaka' means “a treatise compiled on miscellaneous subjects'. According to Malyagiri, the commentator on the Nandīsūtra, the monks used to compose the Prakīrņakas based on the sermons of the Tīrtharkaras (the Prophets Propounders of the Jaina faith). “Caurāsīim painnagasahassāim”, in the Samavāyāngasūtra, points towards eighty-four thousand Prakīrņakas having been composed by the eighty-four thousand disciples of the first Tīrtharikara, Lord Prophet Rsabhadeva.? As there were fourteen thousand disciples in the order of the last (twenty-fourth) Tīrthařkara, Lord Prophet Vardhamāna Mahāvīra, the number of Prakīrņakas now should be of a similar number. However, today the number of Prakirnakas is not definitely known and presently only ten Prakīrṇakas are taken amongst the forty-five canonical works recognised by the idolworshipping white-clad (Svetāmbara Mūrtipājaka) Jainas. These ten Prakīrņakas are as follows? :

In some works we find Candravedhyaka and Vīrastava instead of Gacchācāra and Maranasamādhi,' while in some others we find that the Bhaktaprijña has been excluded while the Candravedhyaka has been included.? Besides, more than one Prakīrņakas bearing the same name are also found. E.g. three Prakīrņakas bearing the name Aturapratyākhyāna and two with the name Catuḥsarana are found.
The Mūrtipūjaka Sampradāya of the Svetāmbara Jaina (Idol worshipping white clad sect of the Jainas) tradition recognises only ten Prakīrņakas as canonical texts. However, according to Muni

PREFACE :XXIII
Again, although the Prakīrņakas enjoy a place of secondary importance in the scheme of canonical works, if we consider the linguistic ancientness and spirituality of contents of these works, some of these Prakīrņakas appear to be of an even more ancient origin than certain canonical texts. The Prakīrņakas like the Rsibhāsita, etc are even more ancient than quite ancient canonical texts like the Uttarādhyayana and Daśavaikālika.' Hence, the importance of Devendrastava in no way reduces by its being included amongst the Prakīrņakas. However, it is a fact that this Prakīrņaka is eulogistic in nature rather than being spiritual or monastic conduct oriented. Its subject matter pertains to the sets of heavenly abodes (Deva-nikāya) and their geography and cosmology.
Eulogistic Literature -
The tradition of singing the praise or eulogising the objects of worship and veneration has been present in India since the very ancient times. Vedas, the eternal and immortal treasure of the Indian sacred lore, are basically eulogistic in nature. Besides the Vedas, too, the eulogistic literature had been composed in the Hindu tradition, but as far as the Sramanic traditions are concerned, they are basically intellectual traditions that do not believe in the existence of Godheads. In the ancient works of the Śramanic tradition, we find literature that emphasises spirituality and Selfpurification rather than worship and devotion. Jaina faith is also a faith belonging to the Śramanic tradition and the eulogistic literature had no place of much importance in its basic characteristic. When Lord Mahāvīra was accepted as an object of worship and veneration, the very first devotional composition was composed in His praise, which exists till today as the sixth chapter of the

XXIV: DEVENDRASTAVA second primary canonical work, Sūtrakrtānga.' Possibly this chapter of the Sūtrakrtānga, Vīrastuti' marks the beginning of the eulogistic compositions in the Jaina tradition. However, this composition can also be called as eulogistic only on the basis of the fact that its author sings the Lord's praise by mentioning His virtues and attributal names. As opposed to the normal genre of eulogistic compositions, he does not beg for any personal mundane favours. After the Vīrastuti, the next work in the style of eulogisto composition was, possibly, the ‘Sakrastava' popularly known as 'Namotthu nam'. This composition is generic in nature that eulogises the Arahantas without naming anyone in particular. However, while Sakrastava depicts the Arahantas as divine beings with extra worldly attributes the Vīrastuti, except a few instances, eulogises Lord Mahāvīra as the best amongst the worldly persons and not as an extra-worldly divine personage. However, it cannot be denied that in this work (Vīrastuti) also some divine attributes have found their entry over the Lord's life-sketch given in the first part of the Ācārānga. Also, while the Vīrastuti of the Sū trakrtānga is a poetry, the sakrastava is in prose. From all this we feel that in the beginning, 'Pucchisu ņam' was the only eulogistic composition in praise of Lord Mahāvīra and 'Namotthu namas the only one in the praise of the venerable Arhantas. The name Sakrastava only confirms this theory, because Sakrastava or Devendrastava also mean the eulogy of the Lord by Sakra or Devendra (the kings of heavenly gods).
After these two, the next composition in this genre is the ‘Logassa or the Caturvimśatistava', which is an eulogistic composition singing the praise of all the twenty-four Tīrtharkaras and, therefore, it is fair to assume that it was composed only after the concept of twenty-four Prophets had firmly established itself

in the Jaina tradition. However, a major difference between the earlier two compositions and this one is that while in the the former the devotee only remembers the virtues of his Lord without asking for any mundane favours, in the latter composition he starts begging for such favours and prays, “O'Lords twenty-four Tīrtharkaras ! pray be pleased and grant me the gifts of good health, enlightenment and liberation.” Possibly, it is here, that in the Jaina tradition, the devotee has used the language of supplication and begging for the first time. Although the Jaina tradition has always believed that the Tīrtharkaras are completely detached from all things mundane and that they neither grant boons nor inflict banes, that they simply show the worldly the path of spiritual emancipation. To see to the devotee's welfare and to punish his foes is not their tasks. From the text of the Logassa sūtra, it becomes quite clear that its composition is clearly influenced by the concurrent Hindu tradition. In this composition the devotee has desired three things from the Lords Tīrtharkaras - Good health, enlightenment and liberation. While the latter two desires may be condoned as being spiritual in nature, the first prayer of asking for the boon of good health is clearly linked with mundane welfare. Although, this prayer is also explained away on a spiritual plane as praying fo good spiritual health by ridding him of the spiritual disease wrought about by the defilement of the soul by the karma-mire, the fact remains that the element of supplication and begging from the Lords had entered the Jaina eulogistic literature, which doesn't go well with the concept of complete detachment associated with the Lords Tīrthankaras.

XXVI: DEVENDRASTAVA
In this very context, later the belief gained ground that the devotees' worshiping the Tīrtharkaras pleases the gods and goddesses of their religious order and they, in turn, ensure the welfare of the devotees. This gave way to the concept of particular gods and goddesses being associated with each Tīrtharkara and independent eulogistic compositions also began to be composed in their (the gods' and goddesses') praise. 'Uvasaggahara' is possibly the first eulogistic composition of the Prāksta literature in which besides the Tīrthařkara Parávanātha, Dharanendra the god (Pārśva-yakşa) attending on Him has also been indirectly eulogised. In this stotra (eulogistic prayer), where on one hand the devotee prays for enlightenment in the form of righteous belief and a position of eternality or immortality or spiritual salvation, on the other he also supplicates that the very name of the karmafree Lord is the magical chant that can destroy the poison of the most venomous snake and grant all well-being. The ill effects of the harmful planets, fever and other diseases of the one, who chants this magical word (the name of the Lord), are easily dispelled. Also, it has been said that the one, who merely bows to Lord Pārsvanātha, frees himself of the misery of many a bad birth. Thus, in this prayer, on one hand the devotee desires spiritual fulfilment and he also prays for mundane favours on the other. If we compare this Uvasaggahara stotra with the Caturvimśatistava, we clearly perceive that in both these eulogistic compositions there are elements of seeking spiritual weal as well as the mundane one. Even then it is clear that the element of praying for mundane boons has markedly increased in the Uvasaggahara stotra as compared to that in the Caturvimśatistava. In the Caturvimśatistava the devotee prays for good health only while in the Uvasaggahara stotra he also seeks cures from fever, other diseases and snake poison. This stotra has been given the form of a magical chant that can

PREFACE :XXVII
effect the desired well-being. This stotra can be considered as the first step in the direction of the entry of such hymns and rituals, in the Jaina literature and tradition, which are reputed to produce miraculous effects. This stotra is believed to be a composition of
Bhadrabāhu II, the brother of the famous astrologer Varāha-mihir of the days of yore.
After this, many such eulogistic compositions cum prayers cum miraculous chants were composed in Prākīta, Samskrta and later in Marugurjara, in which the author and through him the devotees have prayed for mundane weal and wealth. We have included this discussion here in order that the readers may appreciate the sequence and form in which such eulogistic compositions developed in the Jaina literature. Now, we shall evaluate the Devendrastava in this context.
As we have said earlier, it is difficult to decide as to whose eulogy is Devendrastava at all. Where its earlier and concluding verses are in the form of the Tīrthankaras' eulogy, the rest of the composition is full of the descriptions of the heavenly gods and their kings. However, the notable feature of this composition is that no prayer has ever been made from either the Tīrtharkaras or from the gods and the Indras. Only in the penultimate verse it has been said that the Siddhas may grant the author the fruit of ultimate accomplishment of spiritual perfection (Siddhi).' From this consideration this composition apeears to be of a period after that of the Vīratthui' and 'Namotthu nam' and earlier than that of the 'Caturvimśatistava'. However, the only difficulty that presents itself in the way of considering it as older than the Caturvimśtistava is that in the very first verse of this composition also the author

has bowed to Lord Rsabha and Lord Mahāvīra, mentioning them as the first and the last Tīrtharkaras. It, therefore, appears that it was composed after the concept of twenty-four Tīrthankaras had been established. However, we must remember that only the mention of Lord Rsabha as the first Tīrthankara and Lord Mahāvīra as the last does not conclusively prove that the concept of twenty-four Tīrtharkaras was there in front of the author when he composed this eulogy. In the Uttarādhyayana, too, Lord Mahāvīra has been accepted as the last Prophet, but nowhere the concept of twenty-four Prophets has been mentioned clearly. Thus, in the order of development of eulogistic compositions, ‘Devendrastava' appears to be sufficiently ancient.
Again, if ‘Devendrastava’ is considered to be a eulogy of the Indras, the kings of heavens, then it is their eulogy only in the sense that it contains detailed descriptions of their attributes and specialities. Although it contains an exaggerated account of the capabilities of gods and the Indras, it has been clearly mentioned therein that even the wealth of all the gods and Indras be put together and multiplied infinite times it cannot equal the infinitesimalth part of the wealth of the Lords Jina.' From this it appears that though this composition presents an account of the Devendras (kings of heavens), its main object is to eulogise the Lords Tīrtharkaras and to establish their glory.
The Justification Of The Name -
Although this work is referred to as ‘Devindatthao' only in the Nandīsūtra, Pāksikasūtra, etc, if we study its subject-matter carefully, we find that it is actually an eulogy praising the Lords Prophets rather than being an eulogy of the heavenly kings. In its

PREFACE XXIX
310th verse, the author has called himself as Rsipalita, the composer of Devendrastava, a eulogy of Lord Mahāvīra.' The Mūlācāra refers to it as ‘Thudi (Stuti or eulogy) only. Although there is a detailed description of the heavenly kings in this composition, there is not a single verse in this work where they have been eulogised or prayed to. Hence, while interpreting Devendrastava it must be borne in mind that it is not a eulogy of the heavenly kings but a eulogy of the Lord by them. If it is to be considered as a eulogy of the heavenly kings it is so only in the descriptive form.
The Author Of Devendrastava -
The name of Ķsipālita is clearly available as the author of Devendrastava. In the very beginning of this Prakīrnaka edited by Muni Śrī Punyavijayajī and published by Mahāvīra Jaina Vidyā laya, Mumbai (As a part of Painnayasuttāim), there is a clear mention that this Prakīrņaka is a composition by 'Sthavira Rsipālita'2 Not only this, in verses 309 and 310 of its text also twice there is a clear mention, as follows, of the fact that it is a composition by Rsipālita :
a. "Isivāliyamaimahiyā karenti Jinavarānam/"
b. “Isivāliyassa bhaddam suravarathayakārassa vīrassa /” Herein Rsipālita has been clearly mentioned as the eulogist (one offering eulogy). Hence, on the basis of these external as well as internal eviendences, it is proven that Rsipālita is the author of this work. Although Dr. Jagadeesh Candra Jain in his 'Prākrta Sāhitya Kā Itihāsa' and Ācārya Devendramuni Śāstri in his ‘Jaina Āgama Sāhitya : Manana Aur Mīmāmsa' have mentioned
“Suraganaaiddhi samaggā savvaddāpiņdiyā aṇantaguņā| Na vi pāve Jiņaiddhim ņantehim vaggavaggūhim || 307 ||” “Sirilsivālivatheraviraio”

Vīrabhadra as the author of this Prakīrņaka,' they have given no proof in support of their contention. Perhaps, Dr. Jagadeesha Chandra Jain was carried away by the fame of Vīrabhadra as the author of many a Prakīrņaka such as Causarana. Āurapaccakkhā na, Bhattapaiņņā, Ārādhanāpatākā etc and thought that he was the author of this Prakīrņaka as well and mentioned it as such without any verification and even without going through the concluding verses of this work. As Devendramuniji has based his work on the histories of Prāketa literature by Dr. Jagadeesh Chandra Jain and Dr, Nemichandra Jain, he, too, mentioned it as such without due verification from the original text. It was, therefore, natural that he, too, fell pray to the same error of judgement. Although Dr. Mohanlal Mehta in his “Jaina Sāhitya Kā Vrhad Itihāsa' published by Parshvanatha Vidyashram, Varanasi and Acārya Vijaya Padmasūri in his “Jaina Pravacana Kiraṇāvali have dwelled at some length on the subject matter of this work, they have also made no effort to throw any light on the issue of its authorship.? It therefore rests upon us to give a serious thought to the issue of Devendrastava's authorship.
From the mention of Devendrastava in the Nandīsūtra and the Mülācāra it is clear that this work had come onto being in the 5th Century AD. Also, it is clear that its author cannot be Vīrabhadra, who, according to a brief note in the beginning of Painnayasuttāim by Canon-learned Muni Sri Punyavijayajī, his time was 1008 or 1078 VikramīEra.

PREFACE : XXXI
of the name of Vīrabhadra in the text or otherwise in this work, as well as the fact that Vīrabhadra was of a significantly later period as compared to the period of composition of this work, it is certain that its author was not Vīrabhadra. Moreover, as the name of Rsipālita has been mentioned as its author in the original verses of this work,' it proves beyond a shadow of doubt that its author was Rsipālita only and none else.
Now, the question arises as to who was Rsipālita, the author of Devendrastava? When was he there? Although we couldn't find the name of Ācārya Rsipālita in the rolls of Ācāryās (Sthavirāvali) in the Nandīsūtra as well as those of the Svetā-mbara tradition, but on further investigation we ultimately came across his name in the roll of Ācāryas in the Kalpasūtra.? According to this roll of Ācāryas Rsipālita was the disciple of Arya Sāntisena. Not only this, in the Kalpasūtra's roll of Acāryas the MasterDisciple lineage of Rsipālita has also been mentioned. According to this lineage Rsipālita's guru was Ārya sāntisena, śāntisena's guru was Indradinna, the guru of this Indradinna was Ārya Susthita from whom came out the Kodiya monastic branch. Later Arya Śā ntisena established the Uccanāgarī branch in which the famous Vācaka Umāsvāti, the author of the Tattvārthasūtra was there at a later point of time. Again, this roll of Ācāryas further mentions that the Arya Ķsipālita branch of the Kodiyagana started from Ķsipā lita, the author of the present work, it is evident that he was an influential Acārya and a historical figure of his time. In our view this Ārya Rsipālita is the author of this work – Devendrastava. The scholars may have only one objection in believing that the Rsipā lita mentioned in the roll of Ācāryas in the Kalpasūtra as the author of Devendrastava that on this basis the Devendrastava has to be a

very ancient work. However, on studying the linguistic characteristics of this work, we have no doubt about its ancientness. Again, when no mention of any other Rsipālita is available after the one being examined up to the period of Nandīsūtra, we have no choice but to accept the Rsipālita mentioned in the Kalpasūtra as the author of this work. According to the roll of Ācāryas in the Kalpasūtra, the lineage of Rsipālita from the period of Lord Mahāvīra downwards is as follows :

Rsipālita
Rsipalita's Period -
According to the abovementioned lineage of masters and disciples, the position of Rsipālita is twelfth from that of Lord Mahāvīra. In other words there had been ten other Acāryās between Lord Mahāvīra and Ķsipālita. If we take the period of each Ācārya as thirty years on the average, the period of Ķsipālita is at the very least comes out to be around 300 years after the Lord. In this lineage Arya Suhasti is known to be a contemporary of King Samprati, the grandson of Emperor Aśoka the great. Rsipālita is fifth from Ārya Suhasti, hence we will have to agree that Ķsipālita must have been approximately 100 years after Arya Suhasti. King Samprati's reign is believed to be from 216–207 BC. By this consideration Rsipālita's period turns out to be around 107 BC. Thus, Ķsipalita must have lived in the 1st Century BC and hence, the period of composition of Devendrastava must be the 1st Century BC as well.
Here, it would be appropriate to consider the objections that might be there in believing the Devendrastava to be a composition of the 1st Century BC. To this end we will have to consider it from the points of view of its linguistic style as well as its subject-matter. As far as the question of the linguistic style of Devendrastava is concerned, it is true that there seems to be a considerable influence of the Mahārastrī Prākrta on it, but then such influence is also noticed on the linguistic styles of not only

XXXIV: DEVENDRASTAVA as ancient a Prakīrņaka as Rşibhāṣita but also on the first part of the most ancient canonical work – Ācārānga as well as on other canonical works as the Uttatādhyayana and the Daśavaikālika. The fact is that due to the Sruta (the canonical lore)'s being verbal for centuries such linguistic changes had crept in unnoticed before they were reduced to writing as late as 980/993 after the Lord's Nirvāṇa. Also, the different Ardhamāgadhī readings of the Mahārastrī versions are available in some older mss of the āgamic works concerned. Therefore, it is not justified to relegate any work as of a later origin simply on the basis of the influence of Mahārāstrī Prāksta on its text. Again, its linguistic character is certainly older than that of some canonical works such as Praśnavayākaraṇa, etc.
Style -
If we consider the style of Devendrastava, we find that its style is quite different than that of all the āgamic works. In the ancient style ofāgamic compositions, they invariably started with the phrase /– “Suyam me Āusam! Tena Bhagavayā evamakkhāyam ...” (I have heard, O'Blessed one ! that the Lord had said thus ...). In the āgamic compositions of a later date, the style follows the pattern where Arya Jambu puts forth a query, which is then answered by Ārya Sudharmā in the form of a dialogue between Gaņadhara (Principal disciple) Gautama and Lord Mahāvīra. The style of presenting the text containing the canonical content after certain eulogistic verses, as benediction, is followed in the canonical works composed by Acāryas and Sthaviras of the periods later than that of the Ganadharas. This style is noticeable in the more recent Ardhamāgadhi canonical works such as the Nandīsūtra as well as in the Sauraseni canonical works.

PREFACE XXXV
The style of Devendrastava is also of this type. However, there is one characteristic of this work that is at variance from the rest of the canonical works, namely the fact that the āgamic content of this work has been narrated by a lay follower of the faith (Śrā vaka) in answer to the query raised by his wife, a Śrāvika. Thus, we see that the style of this work is a combination of both the styles – the style of satisfying the curiosity of an enquirer as well as that of the eulogistic style.
Amongst the canonical works in the curiosity and satisfaction style, it is probably the only work in which the curiosity has not been expressed by Arya Jambu or Ganadhara Gautama or some other monk and it has not been satisfied by Arya Sudharma or Ganadhara Gautama or the Lord Himself. There appears to be a design behind the curiosity of a Śrāvika being satisfied by a Śrā vaka in this work. In the canonical works such as the Bhagavtīsū tra, Sürya-prajñapti, etc, the descriptions regarding the heavenly gods have been given as if delivered by the Lord Himself and the queries of Ārya Jambū have been answered by Arya Sudharma in the form as answered by the Lord on being enquired by Ganadhara Gautama. Therefore, we are left wondering as to why is it that, here, the queries have been raised by a Śrāvikā and answered by a Śrāvaka. In our view the reason fro this deviation from the established practice is that this work is a eulogistic composition and hence it would have been inappropriate to have it said by the Lord Himself, because He could not have composed an eulogy in his own praise. Also, up to a certain period down the ages the Śramaņas, who were mainly spiritually oriented didn't praise the heavenly gods and hence, the author must have thought that this eulogistic description of the heavenly gods and their kings must

XXXVI: DEVENDRASTAVA be given by a lay follower rather than a monk or Ganadhara or the Lord Himself.
Again, when it has been said in the very beginning of this work that all the heavenly gods and their kings bow to the first and the last Tīrthankaras, then how was it possible that a eulogistic description of the heavenly gods and their kings was given by the Lord who was bowed to by them? At the same time another reason for this deviation could be that for a time the matter of the descriptions of the heavenly gods and that of the Geography and Cosmology were considered to be mundane matters in the Jaina tradition, and hence, this description was presented through a Śrāvaka rather than by an Ācārya or the Tīrtharkara. If we accept this style of Devendrastava on the basis of its subject-matter being of mundane genre rather than that of spiritual importance, we can explain away many anomalies in the descriptions contained in the canonical works devoted to the subjects of astronomy and cosmology when compared to those of the modern scientific astronomy and cosmological findings, and which hurt the nonviolent image of the faith, as mundane beliefs rather than being propounded by the Lord.
In our view, Lord Mahāvīra, who was a propounder of spirituality and moral ethical values with utmost emphasis on nonviolence, must not have had much to do with such mundane beliefs and it must have been the effort of the later Ācāryas to include the subjects of Astronomy and Cosmology also in the canonical works in order to enrich these works with this branch of knowledge as well. Otherwise, these matters had no direct bearing on the Jaina beliefs, which were predominantly spiritual and ethical conduct oriented. This style of Devendrastava saves us from all

these problems and doesn't hold the teachings of the Lord responsible for the anomalies pertaining to this branch of knowledge.
Again, in the Idol-worshipping sect of the Svetāmbara Jaina tradition, the group known as 'Tristutika (Tīna-thui)', doesn't consider reciting the forth step in the panegyric in which the heavenly gods or goddesses or their kings - even those believed to be attending on the Tīrtharikaras – as necessary amongst the pursuit of six necessary practices by a believer. Possibly, this was the view that must have prevailed in the ancient times and, therefore, in the Devendrastava, a Srāvaka has been made to give the descriptions about the gods and their kings. This style of Devendrastava was possible only in the age when the mundane matters, as perceived by the Ācāryas of the later period, were increasingly entering into the Jaina beliefs, which were otherwise spiritual and ethical in their content, but they were not being peddled as being stated by the Lord. Thus, looking at the peculiarities of style and language, the scholars must have no objection in accepting the Devendrastava as a composition of the 1st Century BC.
If we wish to decide the period of composition of Devendrastava on the basis of its subject-matter, we will have to consider the questions – “What is the subject-matter of Devendrastava?” “To which period it may belong?” and “Besides Devendrastava, in which other canonical works is it found?” First of all it is quite clear that the subject-matter of Devendrastava revolves around the descriptions of four types of heavenly gods - Bhavanapati, Vāņavyantara, Jyotiska and Vaimānika, their kings, their residences, their heavens, the shapes and sizes and colours etc of their living mansions and palaces, their life-spans, their powers, their powers of clairvoyance, etc. At the same time the

XXXVIII : DEVENDRASTAVA motions of the Jyotiska gods and their corresponding heavenly bodies have also been discussed, which is in accordance with that contained in the canonical work Sūrya-prajñapti. According to the astronomical beliefs contained in the Sūrya-prajñapti, the scholars have decided that its period of composition must have been around the 3rd Century BC. As the same beliefs have been expressed in the present work, it ought to be a contemporary of the Sūrya-prajñapti or of a period somewhat later than that. We have found that most of Devendrastava's verses, i.e. nearly half of its 300 odd verses, are found in the canonical works such as Sūryaprajĩapti, the Sthānānga, the Samavāyānga, the Prajñāpanā, etc either verbatim or with slight changes. We have given a detailed comparative statement of this aspect at the end of this preface.
This similarity of verses in Devendrastva and the canonical works, referred to earlier, presents two propositions in front of us. Either these verses have gone from Devendrastava into these canonical works or that they have been taken by its author from these other agamic works. Although this can be a difficult and controversial question, in our view, there are some overweighing considerations, which go to prove that these common verses have gone from Devendrastava into these other canonical works. We expect the scholars to give this proposition a serious thought and if they are able to produce some evidence to the contrary, we may not have any objection in agreeing to their theory as well. However, our belief that these verses have gone into the other canonical works from Devendrastava is not unfounded and the scholars must reflect upon these bases before deciding to the contrary. These considerations are as follows: -
Firstly, all the canonical works referred to - Sūryaprajñapti, Sthānānga, Samavāyānga and Prajñāpanā – are all in

PREFACE :XXXIX
prose and the verses in question have been presented after the notation ‘gāhāo? Generally, this practice is followed when a verse/ verses, pertaining to the subject-matter of a treatise, in prose, is/ are quoted from some other work. Since, these verses have been quoted in these canonical works, their period of composition must be earlier than that of these canonical works. If it is to be believed that the period of composition of these verses is later than that of these canonical works, we will have, also, to believe that these verses were added to/ included in their texts at a later date.
Out of the canonical works in which these verses have been found, all (Sthānārga, Samavāyānga, Prajñāpanā and Jīvābhigama) except Sūrya-prajñapti have been considered by the scholars as the compositions of either of the 1st Century AD or afterwards. Sthānānga and Samavāyānga are, in any case, compilatory works of a later period. As the Sthānānga contains mentions of the Ninhavas (circa 584 after Vīra Nirvāṇa) and Gaņas (circa 1st Century BC), it cannot be considered as a composition of a period earlier than the 1st century AD. Similarly, according to the roll of Ācāryas in the Kalpasūtra, Ārya Syāma, the author of Prajñāpana, is an Ācārya of a period after that of Ķsipālita, the probability is that these verses have gone from Devendrastava to this work as well. Similar arguments can be advanced about the Samavāyānga, which is also a compilatory work. It is possible that these have been included in the Sūrya-prajñapti at a later date.
While Devendrastava is an orderly composition, it appears that these verses have been contextually incorporated into the other canonical works. From the linguistic characteristics of these verses in the Devendrastava it is apparent that these are the compositions of the same person at the same time, while the other works in

X L: DEVENDRASTAVA
which these versess are found are compilatory works in which subject-matter from different sources of different times have been compiled. The possibility is that these verses have been taken from Devendrastava, which must have been a popular work for study of the time, at the time of compiling these compilatory volumes. Also, it doesn't seem possible that this work must have been compiled by collecting verses from different sources. The fact that the Devendrastava is a composition by one person and one period, is a sufficient proof that its verses are the original compositions and that they have been incorporated into the other compilatory works and the works on related subjects later. We expect the scholars to go through the comparative statement given at the end of this preface and try to assimilate the truth of this matter.
From the considerations of the author's period, the subjectmatter of the text and the fact of its verses being found in other canonical works conclusively prove that the period of composition of Devendrastava must have been around the 1st Century BC.
The only objection that can be raised in the context of deciding upon the period of the Devendrastava on the basis of its subject matter is that in its text pertaining to the consciousnesses of the Siddhas it has been said about the general and specific perceptions (Darśana and Jñāna) of the omniscient souls (Kevalis) that they happen one at a time and not both at the same time. The dispute between the believers of serialised happening of these two types of consciousnesses versus those of their happening together is very old in the Jaina tradition. While the Ardhamāgadhi Āgamic tradition believed that they happen one at a time the Digambara

PREFACE :XLI tradition believed that they happened together. The earliest attempt to reconcile this difference was made by Ācārya Siddhasena in his work entitled Sanmati-tarka! The author of Devendrastava has emphatically said that these two forms of perceptions occur to the Kevalis only one at a time and not both of them together. From this it appears that the other belief was there in front of him. However, if the other belief was present in front of him, he would have mentioned it earlier and then refuting its contention established his own, as was the general practice of refutation of wrong beliefs and establishment of the right ones at the time. However, he didn't do so. Again, the belief of their serial occurrence is older and āgamic. It is possible that at the time of composition of Devendrastava the dispute had just started and, therefore its author stated his belief so emphatically.
Therefore, Devendrastava cannot be considered as of a later period only on the basis of the presence of this āgamic belief in it as it had already come into being in the āgamic period. Also, it does not have to be viewed in the context of the dispute at all, which for all purposes may have either just started or started much after the period of its composition. Again, all the verses describing the attributes of the Siddhas are invariably found in the Prajñāpana and Devendrastava identically. Only this verse is not found in the Prajñāpana. It is, therefore, possible that this verse may have been added to the text of Devendrastava at a later date when this dispute had gained ground. Moreover, the detailed descriptions about the heavenly gods in this work also contain some details, which are found in the Hindu and Buddhist works of the time. We shall discuss these details when we present their comparative analysis while discussing the subject matter of Devendrastava.

XLII:DEVENDRASTAVA
Subject-matter -
Devendrastava presents a detailed analysis of the heavenly gods and thirty-two kings of heavens (Indras) in a well ordered manner. There are 307 verses in some editions of this work while some others have 311. The treatise opens with a benediction in the form of bowing to the Tīrtharkaras from Lord Rsabhadeva to Lord Mahāvīra. Then, the wife of a certain lay believer (Śrāvaka) asks her husband about the thirty-two kings of gods (Devendras) as to who were these thirty-two Indras, where did they live, how many were their heavens, what were their forms. (Verses 3–11). In reply to her query the Śrāvaka describes the Bhavanapatis, the Vāņavyantaras, the Jyotiskas and the Vaimānikas and, in the end, the Siddhas. Now, we shall serially present a description of these categories.
Bhavanpati Indras -
First of all, the description of the twenty Bhavanapati Indras that has been given in this work can be understood from Table-1. (Verses 15-50).
Vāņavyantara gods –
Eight types of Vāņavyantara gods have been described. They are - Piśāca, Bhūta, Rākşasa, Kinnara, Kimpuruşa, Mahoraga and Gandharva. The names of their sixteen kings (Indras) have been mentioned as Kāla. Mahākāla, Surūpa, Pratirūpa, Pūrņabhadra, Manibhadra, Bhīma, Mahābhīma, Kinnara, Kimpurusa, Satpuruşa, Mahāpuruşa, Atikāya, Mahākāya, Gītarati and Gītayasa respectively. These gods are born in any of the lower, middle and upper parts of the universe. Their minimum life-spans are of ten thousand years and the maximum ones are of one Palyopamayears. (Verses 67–80).

XLIV: DEVENDRASTAVA Jyotişika gods -
Jyotisika gods are said to be five. They are – Moons (Candra), Suns (Sūrya), Stars (Tārāgana), Constellations (Naksatra) and Planets (Graha). Here, in this Prakīrņaka, their numbers, their spreads, their celestial bodies and their diameters have been described in detail (Verses 81–93). A very detailed discussion is found here about the Suns and the Moons. About their speed, it has been said that the Suns move faster than the Moons, the planets move faster than the Suns, the Constellations move faster than the Planets and the Stars move the fastest (Verses 94–96). The periods of conjunctions of various Constellations with the Moons and the Suns have also been given. For instance, the Constellations called satbhisaja, Bharani, Ārdrā, Āślesā, Svāti and Jyesthā have conjunctions with the Moons lasting for the periods of fifteen muhurtas each; three northern constellations – Punarvasu, Rohiņi and Viśākhā have conjunctions lasting for the periods of fortyfive muhurtas each, etc. Similarly, the conjunctions of other constellations with the Moons and the Suns have been given (Verses 97-107).
The numbers of Jyotişika gods in various regions of the universe can be very well understood from the Table-II on the next page (Verses 108–129) :
After this the groups, rows, divisions, their heat regions, their speeds etc have been described. Then the reasons and process of waxing and waning of the Moons have been described. In this context, it has been said that in the brighter halves of the lunar months (Sukla paksa), daily one 62th part of the Moon is uncovered by the planet Rāhu and the Moon waxes from new Moon (Sukla Pratipada) to full Moon (Pūrnima). Similarly, during the darker halves of the lunar months (Krsna paksa), daily one 62"" part of the

PREFACE XLIX
Siddhasila -
Towards the end of this work the author has described the Siddhasilā or the abode of the ultimate spiritually accomplished perfected souls. This land is situated 12 Yojana above the highest dome in the uppermost heaven - Sarvārthasiddha-vimāna heaven. That land, called the Isatpragbhārā prthvī, is in the shape of an upturned umbrella and is 4,500,000 (four and a half million) Yojana wide. Its circumference is somewhat more than 14230249 Yojana.
It is here that the Siddhas – the perfected souls, who have completely freed themselves from the bondage of karma, live. Those Siddhas are free from pain, attachment, affection, physicalbody and have undefined vision (general perception or Darśan) and definite knowledge (particular perception or Jñāna). Their maximum stature is somewhat more than 333 arches (Dhanusa) and the minimum one is somewhat more than one Ratni and eight fingers' width. (Verses 277–306).
In the end, glorifying the Siddhas, the author - Arya Ķsipālita says that all the Bhavanapati, Vāņavyantara, Jyotiska and Vaimānika gods bow to the Arhantas and eulogise them.

LXXXII: DEVENDRASTAVA
The Concept Of Gods In Buddhism -
Buddhism divides the living-beings into five categories – 1. Hellish beings (Nāraka), 2. Sub-human beings (Tiryañca), 3. Ghosts (Preta), 4. Human-beings (Manusya) and 5. Heavenly gods (Devatā). On comparing this concept with that held by Jainism we find that while Jainism classifies Preta, Asura, etc into the category of gods only, Buddhism awards them an independent classification. However, in the Buddhist literature, too, their powers, etc have been mentioned as being equivalent to those of the heavenly gods. Hence, there isn't much difference, here, in the context of the heavenly gods' division. The Buddhist tradition classifies the universe (Loka) into four divisions, namely 1. Kāmā vacara Apāyabhūmi, 2. Kāmasugatabhūmi, 3. Rūpāvacarabhūmi and 4. Arūpāvacarabhūmi. On comparing this classification with that available in the Jaina tradition, we find that the nether-universe (Adholoka) of the Jainas compares with the Kāmāvacara Apāya Bhūmi of the Buddhists, the middle universe (Madhyaloka or Tiryak Loka) with the Kāmasugata Bhū mi, the upper universe (Urdhvaloka) with the Rūpāvacara Bhū mi and the forefront of the universe (Siddhaloka or the abode of the perfected souls) of the Jainas compares with the Arūpāvacara Bhumi of the Buddhists.
However, there is a fundamental difference here. The Buddhists believe that the Arūpāvacara Bhumi also as the residence of the gods, who are formless and exist only as pure conscious entieties. The Jainas consider the Siddhaloka to be the residence of the liberated perfect souls that have shed their karmic bondage completely and exist only as pure conscious soul-matter. In the Buddhist tradition there is no definite concept relating to the

PREFACE :LXXXIII
question of the existence of the completely liberated perfectly pure souls (Siddhas). They are undecided about the question as to whether the Siddhas exist or not, if at all they exist, where? However, we shall adhere to the comparison between the concepts of heavenly gods in these two traditions, without going into the details of question of existence of Siddhas.
Just as, according to the Jaina belief, the heavenly gods reside in the nether, middle and upper universe, according to the Buddhist tradition, too, (taking the Pretas also amongst the heavenly gods) they reside in the Kāmāvacara Apāya Bhumi (Adholoka or the nether universe), Kāmasugata Bhūmi (Madhyaloka or the middle universe), Rūpāvacara Bhūmi (Urdhvaloka or the upper universe) and Arūpāvacara Bhūmi (Siddhaloka or the abode of the liberated souls). Here, it must be remembered that the gods that have been thought of as residing in the Arūpavacara Bhūmi are also unembodied and exist only as pure conscious entities just like the liberated perfected souls (Siddhas) in the Jaina tradition. The only difference being that according to the Buddhist tradition, these unembodied gods existing as pure conscious entities finally liberate after living out their life-duration there without taking rebirths as human-beings. The Jaina tradition, however, believes that the Siddhas residing in the Siddhaloka are already liberated souls that are unembodied and exist as pure conscious entities.
The heavenly gods, whom the Jainas call Asura and Vyantara gods, have been termed as Pretas by the Buddhists. According to the Jainas these Asuras and Vyantara gods reside in the nether universe. Similarly, according to the Buddhists the Pretas also reside in the nether universe termed as Kāmāvacara Apāya Bhūmi. While the Jainas have thought of various heavenly kings

LXXXIV: DEVENDRASTAVA
(Indras) for these groups of gods, the Buddhist tradition considers Yama, the god of death, as the king of the Pretas. Yama, according to the Buddhist tradition, lives 500 Yojanas below the Jambūdvīpa.
A description similar to that of the Bhavanavāsī gods of the Jaina tradition is not found in the Buddhist tradition. However, according to the Buddhists, too, the gods of the Kāmadhātu category have been divided into two subcategories – terrestrial (Bhūmivā si) and celestial (Vimānavāsī). Though the concept of terrestrial (Bhūmivāsī Kāmadhātu) gods of the Buddhists is quite close to that of the Bhavanavāsī gods of the Jainas, the main difference is that according to the Jainas some Bhavanavāsī gods also reside in the nether universe while all the terrestrial gods of the Buddhists reside in the ranges of Mt. Sumeru. The Buddhist tradition further subdivides the terrestrial gods into two main sub-categories – Cāturmahārājikas and Trāyamstrimsakas. The Cāturmahārājikas are, again, of four sub-categories - Karotapānī, Mālādhara, Sadāmada and Cāramahārājika. The second category of terrestial gods are the Trāyamstrimśakas. These thirty-three gods, with their councils, reside on top of Mt. Sumeru. According to the Buddhist preceptors, these Trāyamstrimsaka gods reside on the summit of Mt. Sumeru, which is eighty thousand Yojanas wide and the Brajavāni Yaksas (gods) reside on its auxiliary summits that are five hundred Yojanas high. Sudarśana, the capital town of Sakra (the king of gods) is situated in the middle of this summit, where he (Sakra) lives in the Vaijayanta palace that is 250 Yojanas in spread. Here, we see that while the Sakra and the Trāyamstrimsaka gods have been considered as Vimānavāsī (celestial) in the Jaina tradition, the Buddhist consider them to be terrestrial (Bhūmivāsi) gods.

﻿________________

PREFACE:LXXXV
Again, according to the Buddhists, one category of Caturmahārājika gods only reside in the celestial bodies (Devavimānas) such as Moon (Candra), Sun (Surya), Stars (Tārā-gaṇa), the Jaina tradition has an independent categoriy of gods designated as Jyotiska gods that reside on these heavenly bodies. Although the mention of the Sun, the Moon and the Stars is available in the Buddhist literature, the Abhidhammakośa doesn't mention the constellations (Naksatras) as the Jaina tradition does. According to the Buddhists the Sun, the Moon and the Stars revolve around Mt. Meru and their movements are on the same plane as the Yugandhara summit. Again, according to the Buddhists, the Moon is fifty Yojanas wide and Sun is fifty-one Yojanas in spread. The smallest star is one Kośa (one fourth of a Yojana, nearly two miles) wide and the largest is sixteen Yojanas in spread. Around the Sun there is a firey shell that envelopes it and there is an aura around the Moon that give them their brilliance and Moon-light respectively. In the Buddhist literature there is no mention of the large numbers of Suns and Moons as is there in the Jaina literature. The Buddhist literature merely mentionbs that there is one Moon and one Sun in the four lands.
About the waning and waxing of Moon, where the Jaina tradition holds the Rāhu vimāna responsible for this phenomenon, the Buddhista cite the togetherness of the Sun and the Moon as the reason for it. According to them, when the Moon comes closer to the Sun, the Sun's brilliance casts a shadow behind the Moon and it (the Moon) appears partial or becomes invisible. The Abhidhammakośa mentions that the external association of the Moon is such that sometimes it appears full while at other times it either appears in part or becomes invisible. The reason for the

changing durations of the days and nights has also been given here. Thus, it is apparent that the concepts connected with the Sun(s), the Moon(s) and the Stars as mentioned in the Jaina and the Buddhist traditions are quite at variance with each other and that the concept of waxing and waning of Moon due to the influence of the Rāhu-vimāna is quite ancient.
The situation of the Vimānavāsī gods is above that of the Jyotiska gods. According to the Buddhist tradition the Kāmadhātu Vimānavāsī gods are of four categories - Yāma, Tusita, Nirmāṇarati and Paranirmitavaśavartina. Like this the gods are of six types - two terrestrial types of the Kāmāvacara Sugata Bhūmi (Cāturmahāraijika and Trāyamstrimiśaka) and four celestial types (Vimānavāsī). These gods have been called 'Kāmadhātu' as they generally satisfy their carnal desires in various ways. The Cāturmahārājikas and the Trayamstrimsakas satisfy their carnal lust by cohabition just as the humans do. However, devoid of semen they douse the fire of their lust just by ejaculating air. Out of the other four the Yama gods are satisfied by embracing the members of the opposite sex, the Tusitas by hand-shakes, the Nirmāṇarati gods by jocularity and the carnal desires of the Paranirmitavaśavartina gods are satisfied just by looking at the members of the opposite sex.
Thus, we see a great commonality, in the concept connected with the satisfaction of carnal desires by gods, in the two traditions. Although there is a difference of opinion regarding the types of Vaimānika gods in the two traditions, both the traditions believe that the carnal desires exist up to this category of gods. Where the Buddhist tradition believes in only four types of Vaimānika gods, the Svetambara Jainas believe in twelve and the Digambara Jainas

PREFACE :LXXXVII
in sixteen types of Vaimānika gods.
Just as tha Jaina tradition believes in absence of carnal desire amongst the Graiveyaka and Anuttara-vimāna gods, the Buddhist tration also believes in its absence amongst the Rūpadhātu gods. There are seventeen sub-types of Rūpadhātu gods and the last five types have been termed as Suddhāvāsikas. Just as the Jainas believe in three triads of the Graiveyaka gods, the Buddhists also believe in three dhyānas each consisting of three types (triads) of the Rūpadhātu. The fourth dhyāna, of course consists of three types besides the five Suddhavāsikas. Like this, though there are differences of names etc, generally there is some commonality in the concept pertaining to the gods in these two traditions.
Though there is no similarity in the concepts pertaining to the life-spans and body-statures of the Rūpadhātu gods of the Buddhists with those of the Vaimānika gods of the Jainas, it is seen that the life-spans of the gods of the higher heavens are longer than those of the lower ones. There is a marked difference in the concept of body-stature. While the Jaina belief is that the bodystature reduces as we go into the higher heavens, the Buddhist belief is quite the opposite. However, both the traditions believe that the gods in these heavens are born by sudden manifestation (Upapāduka or Aupapātika). The Buddhist belief has it that the heavenly beings (gods and goddesses) are born by sudden manifestation on the thies of their parents, the Jaina belief is that they are born on the same bed in each heaven.
The most significant difference in the concept of gods in

LXXXVIII : DEVENDRASTAVA
the two traditions is that the Buddhists believe in the existence of the unembodied gods, who exist only as pure consciousness. According to them these gods are formless, that is they don't have physical bodies that can be perceived through the senses. These gods or entities are said to have four levels of meditation-grounds, which are -
Ākāśānantyāyatana, Vijñānānantyāyatana, Akiñcanantyāyatana, Naivasañjñānāsañjñāyatana.
D.
While desiring the bliss of these levels if the conscious entity engages itself in the pursuit of its right-duty and rightmeditation, it keeps on enjoying the pleasures of the formless universe. As the extent of this formless universe is only upto the fourth ground called Naivasaññānāsañjñāyatana, it is also known as the fore–front of the universe (Lokāgra).
By this comparative study we find that this condition of the formless pure conscious entity of the Buddhist tradition compares well with the concept of the Perfected or liberated souls (Siddhas) of the Jaina tradition. As the Siddhas are situated at the fore-front of the universe enjoying eternal bliss, so are the Arūpadhātu gods of the Buddhist tradition exist in the foremost part of the universe only in the form of pure consciousness. The only difference being that while according to the Jainas the situation of the Siddhas there is eternal, according to the Buddhists that of the Arupadhātu gods is temporary for the life-duration of the gods there. The Buddhists believe that on the expiry of the life-span of the Arūpadhātu gods, the purely conscious entity attains final

PREFACE :LXXXIX
liberation and that it doesn't have to take rebirth in this mundane world. Therefore, this condition of the Arūpadhātu gods of the Buddhist tradition is different from the gods of the highest heaven called the Sarvārthasiddha-vimāna. Where the gods of the Sarvārthasiddha Vimānas, on completion of their heavenly tenure, have to be reborn as human-beings before they are finally liberated, the gods of Arūpadhātu category do not get reborn as human beings. As the concept of final liberation is non-existent in Buddhist tradition and it has not been laid down as to what happens to the finally liberated souls, there is no entity in the Buddhist tradition that can compare with the Siddhas of the Jaina tradition.
We have, thus, considered many an aspect of the concept pertaining to the heavenly gods in the two traditions of the Buddhists and the Jainas. In these concepts there are some similarities and some dissimilarities. In this preface, the Jaina concept of heavenly gods has been described on the basis of the present work – Devendrastava while that of the Buddhists has been described on the basis of the third part (Lokanirdeśa) of the Abhidharmakośa.
Similarly, the other faiths - Hindu, Christianity and Islam also hold their own concepts pertaining to the heavens and the heaqvenly gods. It has not been possible to dwell upon all these concepts here due to the limitations of space and time. Here, we would only like to say that like other faiths, the Jaina tradition has also discussed the concept of heavenly gods in great detail. Even then, it must be remembered that in the Jaina tradition the ultimate goal of existence is not to gain the divine birth as heavenly gods, how-so-ever high, but it is to accomplish the ultimate goal of

spiritual liberation. Although the divine existence has been hailed as noble, the Jaina precept has it that the final liberation is not possible from the godly species but only from the human birth. Therefore, the human birth is the best from where one can attain that ultimate accomplishment of Arhatatva (omniscient enlightenment) whom the gods also bow to.
24 November, 1988.
Prof. Sagrmal Jain Dr. Subhash Kothari
(Translated into English by Dr. Colonel D.S.Baya, 'Shreyas)

SRI RṢIPALITA STHAVIRA AUTHORED
DEVENDRASTAVA
PREFACE
After reverentially bowing to all supreme spiritual conquerors, universal teachers and all virtuous Jinesvaras including the first Tirthankara (Lord Prophet Propounder of the Jaina faith) Rsabhadeva and the last-twenty-fourth Tīrthankara, Lord Mahāvīra, some lay follower of the faith, who was decidedly learned in scriptures and tenets of the faith, one early evening started sweetly singing the praise of pride-conquered Lord Vardhamana as his wife sat comfortably in front of him and listened, with folded hands, peacefully and reverentially.
EULOGY IN PRAISE OF LORD VARDHAMĀNA
Along with the celestial queens, whose foreheads are marked with vermilion and other auspicious marks, we, too, bow our heads at the feet of pride-conquered Lord Vardhamana.
The heavenly gods, whose crowns have come lose by bowing deeply and reverently, too, pay their obeisance at the feet of perfectly anger-calmed Lord Vardhamāna of uncomparable fame.
We constantly meditate upon the beauty of His (Lord Vardhamana's) beneficial feet, whose virtues have com pletely won over the thirty-two Devendras, the celestial kings of the heavenly gods.

DEVENDRASTAVA : 5
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THIRTY-TWO INDRAS 7. She (the wife of the Śrāvaka- the lay follower of the faith)
says to her husband, “Pray explain, in detail, about the thirty-two Kings of heavenly gods (Indras), that are said to be there, for the sake of satisfying my curiosity to know about them”. “Which are those thirty-two Indras? Where does each of them live? What is each's life-duration? (and) What are the details of each one's palaces and wealth?”
10.
“How many are each one's celestial planes? How many are the palaces and cities? How much is the thickness of the celestial land on which each one lives? What are the heights and the colours of their celestial bodies?” “How much food does each take during the maximum, medium and minimum period? What is the system of each one's respiration and how much extra-sensory clairvoyant perception does each have?” (On listening to these questions) and dispensing all formality and ceremony, the husband, in all seriousness, replies to her free and frank questions thus – “O beautiful one ! please listen”.
12.
ANSWERS ABOUT THE THIRTY-TWO INDRAS
"In reply to your questions, please listen to the names etc of the (thirty-two) Indras from the analysis that is available (on this subject) in the sacred canonical literature (of our faith).”

THE LIFE-DURATIONS OF BHAVANAPATI INDRAS O' Beauteous one! the maximum life-duration of the Camarendra is said to be one Sagaropama. The same should be understood about Bali and Vairocana also.

DEVENDRASTAVA: 11
35.
The maximum life-durations of the Indras of the South, except that of Camarendra, is one and a half Palyopama.
Except that of Bali, the maximum life-durations of Indras of North are somewhat lesser than two Palyopamas each.
The expanse of the entire Ratnaprabha ground is eleven thousand Yojanas. Therein, after one thousand Yojanas, are the towns and cities of the Bhavanapati Indras.
All the palaces, therein, are quadrangular from within, circular from without and are naturally very beautiful, enjoyable and flawless. They are made of diamond stones.
The palaces of the Bhavanapti Indras are studded with crystal gems and the compound-walls of these palaces are made of gold.
Situated on the best lotus-petals, bedecked with various gem-studded frescoes, those palaces appear naturally enticing.

Their noble gates are eight Yojana tall, their tops are bedecked with red coloured pots and golden bells hang from them.
THE NUMBER OF PALACES OF THE INDRAS OF SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN BHAVANA HEAVENS
(Such are the palaces) where the Bhavanpati Indras remain so engrossed in the songs sung by beautiful young goddesses and music played on celestial instruments that they don't even notice the passage of time.
39. (The Bhavanapati Indras of the South are) Camarendra, Dharanendra, Veņudeva, Pūrṇa, Jalakānta, Amitagati, Velamba, Ghosa, Hari and Agniśikha.
The gem-studded, golden pillared and bedecked with enticing creeper coves, the palces of these Bhavanapti Indras are in the South. Those of the rest of the Indras are in the North.
Towards the South, there are thirty-four lākha (palaces of the Asurakumāras), forty-four lakha (palaces of the Nāgakumāras), forty-eight lakha (palaces of the Suparṇakumāras), forty lakha (palaces each of the Dvīpakumāras, Udadhikumāras, Vidyutakumāras, Stanitakumāras and the Agnikumāras) and fifty lākha (palaces of the Vāyukumaras).

'mahissīo, Sam. | Here, in the ‘Prakīrņakadaśaka’ edited by venerable ssŚrī Sāgarānandasūrīśvarajī, we find the text “cha vvāruņe samudde” printed, which appears to be a alphabet generated confusion. In his commentary on maxim 728 of Sthānāngasūtra, Śrīmad Abhayadevasūri has mentioned the origin of Asurakumāra etc at Aruna samudra and Mt. Aruna. (Folio 482, p.2). Also, there, in that commentary the phrases like “Asurāņam Nāgānam..." "Dīva-Disā-Udahiņam...” from the pair of verses 47-48 have been quoted as references. Again, the second half of verse 48 has been given as “Arunodaya samudde tatthaiva ya tesi uppāyā /” (Folio 483, p. 2).

43.
THE FAMILIES OF THE BHAVANAPTI INDRAS
All Bhavanapti and Vaimanika Indras have three tiered courts constituted by Trāyamstrimśa, Lokapāla and Sāmānika gods. The number of body-guard gods is four times those of the Sāmānika (ordinary) gods.
44.
The number of Sāmānika devas (ordinary gods) - subjects of of various classes of Indras is said to be as – sixty-four thousands Bhavanapatis of the South, sixty thousands of those of the North, six thousands Vāņavyantaras and four thousands of Jyotiska Indras.
45.
Camarendra and Bali have five queens-consorts each, while the rest of the Bhavanapati Indras have six queens-consorts each.
46.
THE RESIDENCES OF BHAVANAPATI INDRAS
Two Bhavanapati Indras reside in the Jambūdvīpa, four on Mt. Manusyottara, six in the Arunasamudra (Aruņa sea) and eight Bhavanapati Indras reside on the Arunadvīpa (Aruna island).
47.
These Bhavanapati Indras are born in/on the same sea (Samudra) or island (Dvīpa) in/on which they have their residences.

SIXTEEN INDRAS OF EIGHT FURTHER DIVISIONS OF THE VĀŅAVYANTARA GODS 71. Sannihita, Sāmānya, Dhātā, Vidhātā, Ķsi, Rsipāla, īśvara,
Maheśvara, Suvatsa and Viśāla -
Hāsa, Hāsaratī, Sreya, Mahāśreya, Patanga and Patangapati - these are the sixteen indras of the eight further divisions of the Vāņavyantara gods in the given order, at the rate of two each.
PALACES POSITIONS AND LIFE-DURATIONS OF THE
VYANTARA AND VĀŅAVYANTARA GODS 73. Vyantara gods are born and live in the upper, lower and
the middle parts of the universe. Again, their palaces are in the upper part of the Ratnaprabha land.
74.
There are innumerable best palaces, each of an immeasurable expanse, for each of the eight pairs of the Vyantarendras. I, now, narrate their characteristics.
75.
The larger of these best palaces resemble the Jambudvīpa, the smaller ones resemble the Bharataksetra and the medium ones resemble the Videhaksetra.
76.
Such are the best palaces that the Vyantara gods, living therein, remain so engrossed in the songs and instrumental music being played by the beauteous young goddesses that they even fail to notice the passage of time.
77.
Similarly, the eight Indras – Kāla, Surūpa, Pūrņa, Bhīma, Kinnara, Satpuruşa, Atikāya and Gītarati – are on the southern side.

There are eleven thousand six hundred and sixteen great planets and three thousand six hundred and ninety-six constellations (that revolve over the human lands).
126.
Similarly, the number of stars over the human habited part of the universe is eighty-eight Lākha (hundred thousand) forty thousand and seven hundred Kota-koti or 884,070,000,000,000,000,000.
127.
Briefly, this is the description of the heavenly bodies that revolve over the human habited part of the universe. However, the Jinas have said that the heavenly bodies that revolve over the remaining non-human habited part of the universe are innumerable.

ORBITS REGIONS AND SPEEDS OF JYOTISKAS
136.
The Suns, Moons, groups of Planets, etc are loosely bonded and, hence, they revolve around Mt. Meru in a clock-wise direction.
137.
Permanent orbits of constellations and stars are also similar. They, too, circumscribe Mt. Meru in a clock-wise direction.
138.
The Suns and the Moons do not move vertically. Their motions are inner, outer, transverse and circular.
139.
The specific movements of the Jyotiskas such as the Moons, 1 the Suns, the constellations, etc affect the pleasures and the pains in human lives.
140.
As a rule, the temperatures rise as we go nearer these Jyotiskas and they decrease as we go farther away from
them.
141.
Their heat regions are in the shape of Kalambuka flowers. The shapes of the heat regions of the Suns and the Moons are narrower within and wider without.
WAXING AND WANING OF THE MOON
142. Why does the Moon wax? Why does it wane? What are
the reasons for the Moon-light and its blackness?
143.
The black vehicle (Vimāna) of Rāhu always follows the Moon at a distance of four fingers below the Moon's path.

In the brighter fortnight, one sixty-second part of the Moon increases daily while it decreases by the same amount in the darker fortnight of every lunar month.
145.
Fifteen parts of the Moon get gradually covered by fifteen parts of Rāhu in the fifteen days of the darker half of the lunar month and in the brighter half they get gradually uncovered.
146.
Thus, the Moon waxes and wanes. These are the reasons for the darker and the brighter halves of the lunar months and the Moon-light and its darkness.
147.
MOVING AND STATIC JYOTISKAS The Jyotiska gods born and peregrinating in the human universe are of five types – the Moons, the Suns, the constellations, the planets and the stars.
148.
Besides these, there are the Suns, the Moons, the planets, the constellations and stars that are without the human universe. They neither move nor peregrinate.
NUMBERS OF MOONS, SUNS ETC OVER THE JAMBŪDVĪPA AND THEIR DIFFERENCES FROM THOSE OVER THE OTHER DVĪPAS AND SAMUDRAS 149. These Jyotiska gods are twice in the Jambūdvīpa, four times
in the Lavana-Samudra, and three times that much in the Dhataki-khanda.
150.
Thus, there are two Moons (and two Suns) in this (Jambu) dvīpa, in the Lavana-Samudra there are four Moons (and four Suns) and in the Dhataki-khanda the number of Moons is three times four i.e. twelve.

The number of Moons (and that of Suns) on any dvīpa or samudra can be obtained by multiplying the number of Moons on the previous samudra or dvīpa by three and adding the numbers of Moons on all the dvīpas and samudras prior to the previous one.
152.
If the number of any Jyotiska - Nakşatras (Constellations), Grahas (Planets) or Tārāgana (Stars) over a dvīpa or samudra is desired, it can be obtained by multiplying the number of Moons there by a suitable number (as given in verses 157-158).
153.
There are Moons and Suns situated outside Mt. Manuşottara. There the Moons are in conjunction with the Abhijita constellation and the Suns with the Pusya.
154.
(Outside the Mānusottara mountain the minimum distance between the Moons and the Suns is never less than fifty thousand Yojanas.
155.
Outside the Mānusottara mountain the minimum distance between one Moon and the other or that between one Sun and the other one hundred thousand Yojanas.
156.
The Suns are at an interval from the Moons and so are the Moons from the bright Suns. They are of many coloured rays. The Moons' rays dimmer and the Suns' are brighter.
157.
One Moon family has eighty-eight planets and twentyeight constellations. Now, I shall describe the Stars.
158.
There are sixty-six thousand nine hundred and seventyfive stars in one Moon family.

NON-EXISTENCE OF INDRAS IN THE GRAIVEYAKA AND ANUTTARAVIMĀNA HEAVENS : BIRTHS UP TO THE GRAIVEYAKA HEAVENS OF THOSE OF OTHER
FAITHS AND CORRUPT VISION
In the heavens above those (Kalpa) the gods are born with the self-governing dispositions, because in the Graiveyaka (and Anuttaravimāna) heavens the births of gods with other dispositions (of mastership or servitude) is not possible.
168.
Those who are of corrupt vision but still observe monastic vows, are born only up to the Graiveyaka heavens and not in the heavens beyond them.
NUMBER OF HEAVENLY ABODES (VIMĀNAS) OF THE
VAIMĀNIKA INDRAS

The body hues of the gods of the Sanatkumāra, Mahendra and Brahmaloka kalpa heavens are lotus coloured. The gods of the heavens beyond (the Brhamloka kalpa) are of white body hue.
The noble gods of the Saudharma and Īsānakalpa heavens are of the colour of heated radiant gold while those of the next three (Sanatkumāra, Mahendra and Brahmaloka) kalpas have the complexion like that of a lotus flower. THE HEIGHTS AND STATURES OF GODS
The heights of the Bhavana, Vāṇavyantara and Jyotiska gods equals seven Ratnis. O' Pretty one! now listen to the description of the statures of the noble Kalpapati gods.
The noble gods of the Saudharma and Īsāna kalpa heavens are seven Ratnis tall. The statures of the gods in each of the next five pairs of Kalpa heavens are equal while they reduce by one Ratni in each subsequent pair.
The Graiveyaka heavens have gods with statures of two Ratnis and the gods of the Anuttaravimāna heavens have body-statures of one Ratni only.
The life-durations of the gods increases as we go from one Kalpa to the next higher one while the heights of the Vimānas reduce by one eleventh from one Kalpa to the next higher one.
The height of a Vimana and the thickness of its ground equal three thousand and two hundred Yojanas.

DEVENDRASTAVA: 59
THE CARNAL SATISFACTION OF GODS
The carnal activities of the gods (and goddesses) of Bhavana, Vāṇavyantara and Jyotiska heavens are physical i.e. they indulge in corporeal carnal acts. O' Pretty one! now, I shall describe the ways in which gods (and goddesses) of the Kalpa heavens derive carnal satisfaction.
The gods (and goddesses) of Saudharma and Īsāna kalpa heavens derive carnal satisfaction physically. Those of the Sanatkumara and Mahendra Kalpa heavens derive carnal satisfaction just by touching each other.
In the Brahma and Lantaka Kalpa heavens the gods (and goddesses) derive such satisfaction by sight i.e. just by seeing each other while those of the Mahaśukra and the Sahasrara Kalpas do so by hearing each other's voices or by talking to each other.
The gods (and goddesses) of the Anata-Prāṇata and ĀraṇaAcyuta Kalpas derive carnal satisfation mentally i.e. just by thinking about it. Gods of heavens beyond the Kalpas don't have carnal desires at all.
THE SMELL SIGHT AND TOUCH OF THE GODS
The gods are sweet smelling just as the fragrance of Gośīṛṣa sandal, incense, Ketakīleaves, Punnaga, Bakula, Campaka and Lotus flowers.
This description of the gods' smell is briefly stated by way of comparison. The gods have stable sight and their touch is very tender.

(In the series) the first is the circular vimāna, the trigonal vimāna the second and the third one is the quadrangular vimāna. After an interval again comes the quadrangular one then the circular one and then, again the trigonal vimāna and so on and so forth.
212.
In the columns of vimānas the circular vimānas come over the circular ones, the trigonal ones over the trigonal vimā nas and the quadrangular vimānas come over the quadrangular ones.
213.
The supporting ropes of all the vimānas are the same from top to bottom and from one end to the other.

218.
The Vāņavyantara gods of the lateral (middle) universe have innumerable cities and mansions. The number of vimānas of the Jyotiska gods is numerable times more than those of the Vāņavyantara gods.
COMPARATIVE NUMBERS OF FOUR TYPES OF GODS
219.
Vaimānika gods are few (numerable), the Bhavanavāsī and Vānavyantara gods are innumerable times more and the Jyotiska gods are numerable times more still.
NUMBERS OF VIMĀNAS OF VAIMĀNIKA GODDESSES
220.
In the Saudharma Kalpa the number of separate vimānas of the Vaimānika goddesses is six hundred thousand (600, 000), in the Iśānakalpa it is four hundred thousand (400, 000).
NUMBER OF VIMĀNAS, NATURE AND SOUND ETC OF
THE ANUTTARA GODS.
221. Five types of Anuttara gods are the best as per the
considerations of class, caste, and appearance. They enjoy incomparable pleasures.
222.
As the gods of the Anuttara-vimānas have the best of sight, sound, smell, touch and taste, the inanimate matter there, too, has the best of these qualities.
223. As the humming black bee enjoys sucking honey from the
best of buds, flowers and lotuses in bloom, so do the gods (and goddesses) of the Anuttara-vimānas enjoy the best of material pleasures.

O' Beauteous one! all of them (gods and goddesses of the Anuttara-vimāna heavens) are as fair as the best of lotuses, they are born in the same heavens (according to their classes) and they experience the pleasure of liberation on coming out of those heavens (i.e. they liberate in the births next to theirs).
THE FOOD AND RESPIRATION OF THE GODS
O' Pretty one! the gods of the Anuttara-vimāna heavens feel like having food once in every thirty-three thousand years.
The gods with medium life-spans have food once in every sixteen thousand and five hundred years.
The gods with life-spans of ten thousand years have food every alternate day.
O' Beauteous one! the gods of the Anuttara-vimāna heavens respirate once in every year and four and a half months.
O' Beauteous bodied one! the gods with medium lifespans respirate once in every eight months and seven and a a half days.
O' Moon-faced one! the gods with the minimum lifespans respirate once in every seven stokas (a measure of time not current now).
The gods respirate one in as many fortnights as their lifespans in Sāgaropama years and they feel like having food once in as many thousand years.

CLAIRVOYANT PERCEPTION OF VAIMĀNIKA GODS 233. O' Beauteous one! I shall, now, describe the subject of the limits of clairvoyant perception of various types of gods serially and in the prescribed order.
235.
236.
237.
DEVENDRASTAVA: 69
I have, thus, briefly described the schedule of eating and respiration of the gods. O' Beauteous one! soon I shall describe their finer details.
Downwards, the gods of the Śakra (Saudharma) and Īsāna heavens see upto the first (hellish ground). Those of the Sanatkumāra and Mahendra heavens see up to the second, the Brahma and Lantaka gods see upto the third and those of the Sukra and Sahasrara heavens see up to the fourth hellish ground.
The gods of the Āṇata and Parāṇata heavens can see up to the fifth hellish ground and, similarly, those of the Araṇa and Acyuta heavens are also able to see upto the fifth hellish ground.
The gods of the lower and middle (triads of) the Graiveyaka heavens are able to see upto the sixth hellish ground, those of the upper (triad of) the Graiveyaka heavens can see upto the seventh hellish ground. The gods of the five Anuttaravimānas can see the entire universe downwards.
In the middle universe, the limit of clairvoyant perception of the gods of life-spans upto a half Sagaropama years is that of numerable Yojanas. The minimum limit of the clairvoyant perception of the gods with life-spans upto twenty-five Sāgaropama years is also numerable Yojanas.

The gods with life-spans more than that (twenty-five Sāgropama years) are able to see upto innumerable lands and oceans. Upwards, all the gods can see upto the heights of the domes of their own Kalpas.
239.
The hellish creatures, the gods and the Tīrthankaras have clairvoyant perceptions from their births and they can see wholly while the others (who acquire it through spiritual efforts) can see only partially.
240.
Thus, I have briefly described the subject of the limits of clairvoyant perception. Now, I shall, again, describe the colours, thicknesses and heights of the Deva-vimānas.
DESCRIPTION OF VIMĀNAS, MANSIONS, PALACES, LIFE-SPANS RESPIRATION AND BODIES ETC OF THE
VAIMĀNIKA GODS 241. The land in the Saudharma and the īśāna Kalpa heavens is
two thousand and seven hundred Yojana thick and it is strewn and studded with various kinds of gems.
242.
In those vimānas there are many mansions and palaces with beautiful gem-studded platforms, domes of Vaidūryagems, which are decorated with gem-garlands and gem studdedjewellery
243.
Out of those Deva-vimānas, the black ones, where the gods live, appear like the black metal or the dark cloud or the crow-feather.
244.
The green coloured Deva-vimānas, where the gods live, appear like the Medaka metal or like the neck of the peacock.

247. These gods have bodies that don't show age and which always appear fresh and clean. They wear garlands which don't wilt, their exhalation is fragrant, they emit light and their eye-lids don't bat.
250.
DEVENDRASTAVA: 73
Out of those Deva-vimānas, the flame coloured ones, where the gods live, appear like the Hingula metal or the Japa flower or the Sun.
Out of those Deva-vimānas, the yellow coloured ones, where the gods live, appear like the Koranta metal or the blooming yellow flower or turmeric.
All gods are skilled in seventy-two skills. They always fall from the heavens during the process of change of birth. (ie. on the expiry of their heavenly life-span, the gods are always reborn in species, which are lower than their own).
The natural bodies of those gods, who enjoy the fruits of their meritorious karma, are without clothes or jwells. However, they wear clothes and jwells manifested at will.
Like the round mustard-grains are exactly alike, these gods are also exactly similar in their glories, complexions, statures, sizes, and life-spans etc.
251. There, in those Kalpa heavens, there are five hundred black, blue, red, yellow and white tall and graceful mansions and palaces.
252. There are many types of seats, large and decorated bedsteads, clothes, jewells and gem-garlands, which are studded with hundreds of precious gems.

1 Here, in the available versions, the different readings such as niveyaṇā, nivveyaṇā, niceyaṇā, nicceyaṇa are seen. In the Prajñā panasūtra, too, the available reading is 'aveda avedaṇā, nimmamā asanga ya' (Sūtra 211 verse 158). After perusing all the different readings in various copies of Devendrastava, we have decided to take the 'niccayaṇā' version. 'Niccayaṇa-niścyavanāḥ or immortal, free from birth, decay and death, etc. It appears that the intended reading is nivveya and the difference in reading is a result of the author's negligence. Even then there is no loss of meaning here. "Ottasavvoṇā' in all the copies, here the text is in accordance with the Prajñāpanāsūtra.

284.
There, those Siddhas are certainly without any pain, affection, attachment and bodies but shaped by their densed soul-spaces.
285.
Where do the Siddhas stop? Where are they situated? Where do they discard their bodies? And where do they attain the perfect accomplishment of Siddhatva?
286.
The Siddhas stop at the beginning of the non-universe (Aloka). They are situated at the foremost portion of the universe. They discard their bodies in the middle universe. And they attain the supreme accomplishment of Siddhatva on reaching there (Siddhasila).
287.
The shapes of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddhas are the same as those at the ultimate moment of discarding their bodies in this (middle) universe.
288.
The sizes of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddhas are two thirds of the large or small statures in their respective last births just before liberating from this world.
289.
The maximum stature of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddhas is somewhat more than three hundred thirty-three bows (Dhanusa).

The medium stature of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddhas is somewhat more than four and two thirds Ratnis.
291.
The minimum stature of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddha is somewhat more than one Ratni and eight fingers.
292.
The statures of the densed soul-spaces of the Siddhas are one third less than the statures of their last bodies. The forms of the Siddhas, who are free from ageing and death, are invariable.
293.
Where one Siddha resides, infinite number of worldly bondage destroyed and liberated Siddhas can reside. All of them reside touching the top end of the universe and accommodating one within the other.
294.
The attributes of the Siddhas are incorporeality (bodylessness), densed soul-spaced, always engaged in the unspecific vision (Darśan) and specific knowledge (Iñān).
295.
The perfected soul (Siddhātmā) touches infinite other Siddhas with its soul spaces. Those touched by the parts of soul-spaces are innumerable times more.
296.
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SIDDHAS Through their infinite pure (specific) knowledge (omniscience) the Siddhas know all the qualities and modes of all substances. Through their infinite (general) vision they see everything every time everywhere.

Out of these two consciousnesses of infinite general perception ¢Kevaladarśana) and infinite specific perception (Kevalajñāna), all omniscients have one at a time and not two of them together.
298.
THE BLISS AND SIMILIES OF THE SIDDHAS Even if all the pleasures of all the heavenly gods be multiplied infinite times and squared again and again infinite times, they together cannot reach (compare with) the infinite bliss of the Siddhas.
299.
The unhindered pleasure that is available to the Siddhas is neither available to the humans nor to any of the gods.
300.
If the infinite bliss of the Siddhas is square-rooted infinite number of times, the quantity (numerical value) that is obtained is unaccomodable in the entire space.
301.
An uncivilised country bumpkin knows but cannot describe many an attributes of the town due to lack of similies (in his language) i.e. due to his lack of ability to put in words what he knows.
302.
Similarly, the infinite bliss of the Siddhas is incomparable and cannot be described. Even then I shall try to describe it with the help of some similies, listen.
303.
Eating and drinking the best foods and drinks satisfy a hungry and thirsty person, as if he has ingested elixir.
304.
Similarly, the Siddhas always remain completely satisfied and contented on acquiring incomparable, eternal and unhindered bliss of liberation.

305.
May Ķsipālita, the author of this eulogy of the Indras and the Lord (Mahā)vīra, be blessed. May the Siddhas, the spiritual teachers and torch-bearers of the gods and the demons, whom all the glorious Indras also bow, bless him with eternal bliss of Siddhi.
306.
Thus, the eulogy of the gods of Bhavanapati, Vānavyantara, Jyotiska and Vaimānika heavens has concluded.
